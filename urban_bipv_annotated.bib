	abstract = {To support urban energy transition, energy retrofit of building stock plays a key role since the majority of existing buildings have inadequate performances in comparison to current energy regulations. At the same time, the need to increase the building retrofit rate in a sustainable way can find advantageous applications through local renewable energy systems (RES) such as photovoltaics. However, the energy demand of existing buildings (and energy retrofit measures) and the potential RES production have been generally considered as separated disciplinary fields so far. Conversely, a synergic and integrated approach can be more efficient in terms of time and/or costs and can bring to novel urban energy strategies and policies enhancing the energy retrofit rate and the integration of photovoltaic in buildings (BIPV). Therefore, thanks to systematic analysis of the literature of these two disciplinary fields in terms of approaches, methods, tools and analysed characteristics, this paper aims at identifying their synergies, which can allow to set the basis for an integrated assessment of the urban BIPV retrofit potential for facades. Indeed, differently from other RES, BIPV, as multifunctional element, can both improve the energy performance of building envelopes and produce electricity from solar radiation in urban contexts.},

Cities not only contribute to global climate change by emitting the majority of anthropogenic greenhouse gases but also are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and extreme weather. We explore options for establishing sustainable energy systems by reducing energy consumption, particularly in the buildings and transportation sectors, and providing robust, decentralized, and renewable energy sources. Through technical advancements in power density, city-integrated renewable energy will be better suited to satisfy the high-energy demands of growing urban areas.

	abstract = {To foster urban energy transition needed to limit the growing climate change’ effects, the urban BIPV retrofit of façades can play a significant role thanks to the transformation of the existing energy-intensive building sector into an efficient energy producer. However, currently, there is a lack of tools for the evaluation of such potential mainly because it relies on several fragmented and heterogeneous urban data. Nevertheless, to exploit the not-negligible contribution of retrofitting façades with BIPV in urban energy transition, the assessment of this potential at the urban level should be considered. Therefore, this paper presents a novel integrated 3D GIS-based methodology for the evaluation of this potential, especially for the Swiss context and multi-family house buildings by combining data for the evaluation of the envelope retrofit potential and by increasing the accuracy of the assessment of the BIPV façade potential beyond typical LOD2. Moreover, it includes GIS-based tools for evaluating the BIPV façade potential, the energy retrofit potential of envelopes, and the annual and seasonal urban energy balance. Finally, implementation’ results show that increasing the urban data’ accuracy can significantly affect the urban BIPV retrofit potential of façades, thus providing new crucial information for energy planning.},

	abstract = {To unlock the solar energy integration in the built environment, the assessment of the BIPV potential for existing urban areas represents a preliminary fundamental step. In fact, by knowing the BIPV potential, urban decision makers can support the integration of PV in the urban environment with appropriate policies to achieve energy transition goals. Specifically, to assess urban BIPV potential of façades, not only solar radiation algorithms are required but also the identification of construction façade characteristics, which significantly affect the real BIPV exploitability. However, current urban BIPV façade cadastres generally do not considered such characteristics since the majority of them are based on 3D city-models at LOD2, meaning that the influence of architectural elements (such as windows, balconies, etc.) is not evaluated. Therefore, this work proposes a calculation method capable to match existing solar radiation analysis at LOD2 with architectural characteristics of façades, through building typological indicators, in order to better estimate the urban BIPV potential of façades, namely defined as LOD2.5, without the need of LOD3 models, which involve important investments at urban level. The results demonstrate that such method can improve the current estimations and it creates the framework to be suitably implemented within city solar planning tools.},

Furthermore, a capability of solar design methodologies and tools to accurately and time efficiently simulate light phenomena can greatly influence performance results and design decisions. This is especially important in complex cases such as dense urban settings with the significant surface shadowing, and vertical facades including daylighting devices and photovoltaics. Consequently, choosing a suitable approach and tool for each design phase is essential for achieving unique design and performance goals. This paper was carried out within the framework of IEA-PVPS Task 15 – BIPV and it aims to facilitate this decision for all parties involved in solar design process. Here presented, is an overview of almost 200 solar design tools, analyzing their numerous features regarding accuracy, complexity, scale, computation speed, representation as well as building design process integration in about 50 2D/3D, CAD/CAM and BIM software environments. Furthermore, tools from various fields have been analysed in a broad interdisciplinary context of solar design with a particular attention for being used for Daylighting and Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) purposes. This approach should open many new perspectives on a potentially wider multidisciplinary usage and interpretation of solar design tools, sometimes well beyond their initial scope of work.},

	abstract = {Despite the steady growth of grid-connected installed capacity in Singapore in the last decade and intensive government effort towards “solarization”, implementation of photovoltaics (PV) and especially building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) into the built environment has not gathered as much momentum as would have been expected given the country’s ample solar energy resource potential, strong economic fundamentals and the robust real estate sector. Based on a conducted web-survey and qualitative interviews among local professionals, this paper examines the obstacles, potentials and drivers that could facilitate and accelerate BIPV and PV façade integration, as well as needs that could encourage wider PV use. In order to define a unified strategy, aligning the stakeholders’ views, the following disputable factors are pointed out and discussed: (1) incomplete understanding of BIPV and building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV) among stakeholders, (2) costs of BIPV systems, (3) low awareness of and confidence in “integrability” of PV modules, (4) incomplete knowledge about and insufficiently investigated PV performance and (5) potential of PV façade and roof integration. Since the costs are the key identified factor for BIPV implementation, life-cycle cost (LCC) assessments of PV façade and roof integrations have been performed, which supported the search for solutions to identified problems. The performed analysis and findings present the basis for the development of a long-term holistic strategy for PV implementation in Singapore that could help the highly-urbanized, tropical resource- and land-constrained island city-state reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and achieve the climate change targets, thus promoting a more sustainable built environment.},

In this paper, four different urban forms in the city of Constantine, a cold semi-arid city in Algeria, are analysed. Using the Citysim model, calibrated against local electricity and gas demand, and weather data taken from Meteonorm7.0, for both present and future climates, the study shows a significant difference between the energy demands of the urban forms due to their typo-morphological indicators. It is also shown that a small area of photovoltaics on rooftops can supply building demand, highlighting the favorable solar potential for the location. Future climate projections, for 2050, within the lifetime of many buildings, are expected to lead to higher energy demand, particularly in the summer. The increase in photovoltaic capacity to address that higher demand will open the opportunity to replace a significant fraction of gas usage with solar-powered heat pumps in the heating season.},

The results of this study provide an informed reference for future researchers in understanding the historical development of BIPV, as an emerging and important solar power generation technology in the built environment. At the same time, big data of patents are analyzed using SNA and text clustering, which overcomes the limitation of previous methods of frontiers study that have depended on expert opinion or peer review.},

	abstract = {Increased demand for conventional energy like coal, natural gas, and oil, forcing researchers to develop renewable or non-conventional energy resources. Renewable energy sources such as fuel cells, wind and solar have received considerable attention because of the ever-increasing demand and electricity expectations. The most prominent and mature technology, including various technologies for harnessing solar energy, is the photovoltaic conversion from sunlight to electricity. To generate maximum solar energy, it is required to have more land in an open space to install solar panels and we know the land is already a burning crisis in most countries. Through constructing a holding system of PV modules with a vertical pole on the ground and retaining the PV cells in a structure similar to branches and leaves of a natural tree, the minimum land can be used for optimum solar absorption by creating the maximum solar surface. Therefore, the system is called a solar PV tree. Solar photovoltaic tree structures use 1\% land area and increase efficiency by approximately 10 − 15\% by providing variable height and innovative design compared to flat solar PV. Solar PV trees are artificial solar architectures that look like a natural tree. Solar tree designs are distinctive and created to provide specific support to various urban and natural environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of available different designs and applications of solar photovoltaic trees in the world. This paper also reviewed solar PV tress performance in terms of energy, economic, and environmental.},

	abstract = {Many countries apply measures for the limitation of the conventional energy technologies and try to expand the use of renewables. As the building sector accounts for almost 40\% of the energy consumption in Europe, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems gain peoples’ interest lately concerning the replacement of the conventional construction materials of the buildings envelope with photovoltaic (PV) panels which can serve at the same time as construction material and energy producer. The aim of this study is to present an overview of the available published research on the BIPV systems and identify the barriers and risks associated with the application of BIPV and discuss the future perspectives and solutions through recommendations for future research and development. The most important barriers of the BIPV systems are the feed in tariff implementation, the public acceptance, the governmental economic support in terms of subsidies and technical aspects like the power losses and the architectural considerations. The future perspectives of the BIPV systems proposed are based on the barriers discussed. It is stated that new solutions in the PV industry are many and various and there is room for improvement regarding design, configuration, ventilation, positioning, guidelines, monitoring and performance prediction. In total, more than 100 articles have been identified and analysed since 2000. Many of these articles have a predominant focus on the investigation of the performance of the system, and the ventilation of the PV panels in BIPV applications for electricity production, due to the negative role of the temperature on PVs electrical efficiency, and the heat transfer behavior of the system. This paper shows that although research in the adoption of BIPV systems in terms of their performance and optimization is fairly new, it has gained attention in the last decades. However, their practical applications have been slow in comparison with the conventional rack-mounted PV panels.},

	abstract = {Technological advancement in Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has converted the building façade into a renewable energy-based generator. The BIPV façade is designed to provide energy generation along with conventional design objectives such as aesthetics and environmental control. The challenge however, is that architectural design objectives sometimes conflict with energy performance, such as the provision of view and daylight versus maximum power output. In innovative cases, the characteristics of conventional BIPV façades have been modified by researchers to address such conflicts through customization as an emerging trend in BIPV façade design. Although extensive reviews exist on BIPV product types, design integration, adoption barriers and performance issues, research on BIPV customization has not been reviewed as a solution to BIPV adoption. This paper seeks to review the potential of BIPV façade customization as a means of enhancing BIPV adoption. The current paper identifies customization parameters ranging from the customization category, level, and strategies, and related architectural potential along with an assessment of their impact. The findings reflect that elemental and compositional level customization using combined customization strategies provide enhanced BIPV products. These products are well integrated for both energy generation and aesthetic applications with a power output increase of up to 80\% in some cases. The paper concludes that a wide range of BIPV adoption barriers such as aesthetics, architectural integration, and performance can be overcome by appropriate BIPV customization.},

	abstract = {The design of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) often involves complex geometries, non-uniform irradiance conditions and partial shading. This can lead to high energy losses if not considered adequately. This paper presents a BIPV modeling and optimization method which uses a parametric 3D modeling tool, coupled to a high-resolution ray-tracing irradiance simulation and an electrical model based on the single diode model on a subcell level. With the use of a genetic algorithm, electrical interconnections of the modules are optimized for maximum yield. The presented approach allows the simulation and optimization of BIPV in urban environments where complex shading occurs and high electrical mismatch of photovoltaic cells and modules is to be expected. It allows specific geometric design and optimization of photovoltaic installations and their electrical layout. The electrical simulation is validated for both flat and curved thin-film CIGS modules, as well as for two connected thin-film CIGS modules under deferring irradiance and partial shading conditions. The presented method is further applied in a case study on a double-curved roof shell. The results show that by using genetic algorithms the layout can be optimized to minimize the string mismatch losses for BIPV networks with a variety of modules. The detailed electrical simulation allows to quantify effects of module designs and inverter concepts on the system performance. This is demonstrated for the case study, indicating that thin-film modules with longitudinal cell direction outperform modules with orthogonal cell direction by up to 8\%. Furthermore, module-integrated bypass diodes show little benefits for the best performing module technologies. Post-processing the results allows the evaluation of annual, seasonal, daily and hourly losses on a highly disaggregated level.},

The main perceived barriers for widespread building integration of solar energy are economic feasibility, lack of available materials and lack of knowledge about the integration process. In the past, economical aspects and product diversity have been addressed by joint research and industry eﬀorts, resulting in a growing number of products and decreasing costs. To further support knowledge transfer and foster the design with solar materials in the built environment, we present an early design stage framework for thermal and electrical activation of building envelopes with solar materials. The goal of the framework is to provide fast feedback of energy performance values and visualizations to study the interactions of building geometry, building systems and aesthetic design choices. Design choices include cover technologies with diﬀerent colors, photovoltaic cell types and thermal absorber types as well as heating system choices. The calculations are based on physical and semi-empirical equations. Typical values have been implemented to make the framework accessible to non-experts. Results are compared with experimental data from literature and the impact of design choices is demonstrated by a case study where diﬀerent combinations and diﬀerent cover types were investigated.},

This paper explores the possibilities of improving the energy efficiency of sacred heritage buildings by utilizing photovoltaic systems. As an exceptionally significant cultural good, the Cathedral of St. Michael the Archangel in Belgrade shall serve as a case study, with the aim of examining the methods of mounting photovoltaic (PV) panels, taking into account the fact that the authenticity and the aesthetic value of this cultural monument must remain intact. A comparative analysis of the two options for installing PV panels on the southwestern roof of the church was performed using simulations in PVgis and PVsist V6.84 software, with the aim of establishing the most efficient option in terms of power generation. The simulation results show that photovoltaic panels can produce 151,650 kWh (Option 1) and 150,894 kWh (Option 2) per year, while the required amount of energy is 42,726 kWh. The electricity produced exceeds the electricity requirements for the decorative lighting of the Cathedral Church, so it can be used for other purposes in the sacred complex.},

The starting point is an analysis of the relevance of BIPV technologies for the decarbonization of energy systems, providing energy for direct use of electricity and sector coupling together with an analysis of the German BIPV market. The paper presents the wide range of technical design options for BIPV systems and categorizes and analyzes them to provide a structured overview. This comprises a detailed analysis of the design options for BIPV modules, in which not only the design options for the PV cell layer were comprehensively investigated, but also the different variants of embedding materials, front and rear cover materials, additional interlayers and electrical module layout. Two fundamental module-level design options were investigated in particular detail: The use of PV cells as basic elements of patterns and the use of color to conceal the PV cells. Subsequently, options for the design of complete electrical systems are reviewed, ranging from sub-module level design parameters to building energy systems. Design options for the constructional integration of BIPV modules in the building envelope complete the review of technological design possibilities.},

	abstract = {Building-integrated photovoltaic technology (BIPV) is a decentralised renewable energy source with a building material function. Lack of confidence in the economic viability of BIPV has become one of the critical issues in investment decisions. Therefore, there is a need to review the real economic value of recent BIPV projects to dispel the common myth of the high cost of BIPV. This paper reviews forty-five (45) BIPV projects attached to non-domestic buildings located in twelve (12) western countries between 2009 and 2018 to understand their real economic value. Levelized cost energy, net present value and discounted payback periods are estimated to identify both direct and indirect benefits of BIPV. The economic assessment revealed that projects are economically feasible when both direct and indirect are measured. Analysis further discovered that 1) curtain wall, double-skin facades, discontinuous roofs and skylights among the building application types, 2) educational buildings among the functions of non-domestic buildings and 3) c-Si among the module technologies are economically feasible performances. BIPVs are complex and unique designs with diverse economic performances. It is important to carefully select the parameters to assess the performance levels of the application before any decision is made. The study confirms that understanding the broad values facilitates the quantification of the real contribution of BIPV. The outcome of the paper assists decision-makers and policymakers in developing strategies to decide BIPV adoption.},

The ensemble combines several gradient boosting on decision tree algorithms and Bayesian logistic regression. In a presented case study, the model is trained on three summers of hourly weather data and indoor air temperature data of a south-facing, naturally-ventilated office in Vancouver, Canada. The model is then used to predict thermal comfort exceedance under a possible climate change scenario. It is found that the ensemble outperforms its individual models in terms of accuracy, precision, and similar metrics. In eight of nine trials using the ensemble to re-assess known history, the ensemble predicts total comfort-exceeding days within a margin of one day. Under the RCP 8.5 global climate change scenario, the model predicts annual comfort-exceeding days will double before the 2050s, by that point exceeding current local thermal comfort compliance guidelines. Future applications of the presented methodology may assist other areas of data-driven forecasting, such as peak energy demand prediction. It may also assist analysis of emerging space cooling solutions such as radiant cooling of free-running buildings.},

The greatest potential for reducing energy consumption in private households is through retrofits of existing houses. One of the most common ways to promote retrofits is the act of sending an energy advisor to visit homeowners in order to explain the technological and economic advantages that arise from undertaking a retrofit. However, little is known about how homeowners make sense of retrofits. Based on an extensive anthropological fieldwork study of 12 Danish homeowners who had received energy advice, retrofits were investigated from the perspective of the everyday life of homeowners. Three social dimensions that played an important role when the people in the study discussed house renovation were identified and discussed: houses as part of homeowners’ life cycles and personal events; houses as frameworks for social relations; and houses as markers of social values and status. These results indicate a need to develop new strategies to promote retrofits more effectively, which focus less on the techno-economic aspects and more on the social dimensions.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns the combination of experts' probability distributions in risk analysis, discussing a variety of combination methods and attempting to highlight the important conceptual and practical issues to be considered in designing a combination process in practice. The role of experts is important because their judgments can provide valuable information, particularly in view of the limited availability of “hard data” regarding many important uncertainties in risk analysis. Because uncertainties are represented in terms of probability distributions in probabilistic risk analysis (PRA), we consider expert information in terms of probability distributions. The motivation for the use of multiple experts is simply the desire to obtain as much information as possible. Combining experts' probability distributions summarizes the accumulated information for risk analysts and decision-makers. Procedures for combining probability distributions are often compartmentalized as mathematical aggregation methods or behavioral approaches, and we discuss both categories. However, an overall aggregation process could involve both mathematical and behavioral aspects, and no single process is best in all circumstances. An understanding of the pros and cons of different methods and the key issues to consider is valuable in the design of a combination process for a specific PRA. The output, a “combined probability distribution,” can ideally be viewed as representing a summary of the current state of expert opinion regarding the uncertainty of interest.},

	abstract = {Purpose Traditionally, early-stage investment decisions on buildings purely based initial capital costs and simply ignored running costs and total lifecycle cost. This was basically due to the absence of estimating models that yield running costs at the early design stage. Often, when the design of a building, which is responsible for 10–15\% of its total cost, is completed, 80\% of the total cost is committed. This study aims to develop a building characteristic-based model, which is an early-stage determinant of running costs of buildings, to predict the running costs of commercial buildings. Design/methodology/approach A desk study was carried out to collect running costs data and building characteristics of 35 commercial buildings in Sri Lanka. A Pareto analysis, bivariate correlation analysis and hedonic regression modelling were performed on collected data. Findings According to Pareto analysis, utilities, services, admin work and cleaning are four main cost constituents, responsible for 80\% of running costs, which can be represented by highly correlated building characteristics of building height, number of floors and size. Approximately 94\% of the variance in annual running costs/sq. m is expressed by variables of number of floors, net floor area and working hours/day together with a mean prediction accuracy of 2.89\%. Research limitations/implications The study has utilised a sample of 35 commercial buildings due to non-availability and difficulty in accessing running cost data. Originality/value Early-stage supportive running costs estimation model proposed by the study would enable construction professionals to benchmark the running costs and thereby optimise the building design. The developed hedonic model illustrated the variance of running costs concerning the changes in characteristics of a building.},

	abstract = {This study investigates an energy-inefficient council housing tower block in London, due for retrofit, by exploring the correlations between occupancy and energy consumption patterns, thermal comfort and building energy performance in the winter. The aim of this study is to evaluate the building performance and develop a reliable building simulation model to be employed in the second phase of the study for developing an energy-efficient and cost-effective retrofit strategy to support the council's plans. The research seeks to demonstrate the significance of using dominant occupancy and energy use profiles as opposed to relying on standardised profiles when calculating building energy consumption using building simulation software. The paper reports on the results from the first phase of the study where a quantitative methodology; including a questionnaire, structured interviews, indoor monitoring, and building simulation modelling was adopted. The results provide evidence that occupants’ socio-demographic characteristics have a considerable impact on household energy consumption and fuel bills. The results also show that indoor environmental issues experienced in many flats are partly attributed to the thermally inefficient building envelope and partly due to occupants’ patterns of operating their homes with evidence of excessive heating energy use in attempts to alleviate the indoor issues experienced.},

	abstract = {A proliferation of energy models has been developed across disciplines to explore energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reduction strategies in cities. Hybrid models are especially useful because they incorporate more dynamics to simulate realistic results informed by relevant high-level policy decisions and building-level factors. Spatial and aspatial energy models, however, are not often linked, which overlooks the spatial impact of energy and emissions policies in urban environments. A new method is presented that links these types of models to understand how building stocks change over time in response to policies. This approach integrates outputs from an aspatial economic model, CIMS, with buildings in a spatially explicit urban building energy model (UBEM), UMI. The energy–economy model is parameterised against the UBEM using identified baseline condition and proposed future policy interventions. Building stock replacement and retrofit change are downscaled and disaggregated to individual buildings based on existing stock age and a probability-based Markov chain model (MCM). This integration enables simulations of cross-scale policy interventions that are sensitive to both economically and mechanically driven factors. An application of this approach shows how it can be used to evaluate how different policies interact with and influence building energy demand and GHG emissions.

 

Practice relevance

The results are integrated as a series spatially explicit energy modeling procedure (UMI) at the neighborhood scale. This process enables local assessments of efficacy of the proposed city scale and even regional policies in municipalities with various energy and GHG emission agendas. In the presented case study (of the Sunset neighborhood of Vancouver, BC, Canada) this method can quantify the elasticity of emission reductions from various urban form changes (e.g. infill, transportation-oriented development, etc.), new building code (i.e. BC Energy Step Code), active transportation and retrofit strategies from 2020 to 2050.},

	abstract = {Background
Population screening for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using ultrasound has the potential to improve survival outcomes; however, a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) has yet to be performed. Owing to the lack of existing evidence, we performed structured expert elicitation to derive unknown quantities to inform the CEA.
Objective
To elicit the cancer stage distribution (proportion of individuals with each stage of cancer) for different RCC screening scenarios and the annual transition probabilities for undiagnosed disease becoming diagnosed in the National Health Service.
Methods
The study design and reporting adhered to the Reporting Guidelines for the Use of Expert Judgement in Model-Based Economic Evaluations. The elicitation was conducted face-to-face or via telephone between each individual expert and the facilitator, aided by online material. For multinomial data, Connor-Mosimann and modified Connor-Mosimann distributions were fitted for each expert and for all experts combined using mathematical linear pooling.
Results
A total of 24 clinical experts were invited, and 71\% participated (7 urologists, 6 oncologists, 4 radiologists). The modified Connor-Mosimann distribution provided the best fit for most elicited quantities. Greater uncertainty was noted for the elicited transition probabilities compared with the elicited stage distributions.
Conclusion
We performed the first expert elicitation of RCC screening parameters, crucial information that will inform the CEA of screening. In addition, the elicited quantities may enable future health economic evaluations assessing the value of diagnostic tools and pathways in RCC.},

Bayesian methodology can be used to maximise what is learnt from clinical trials in these circumstances. We elicited expert prior opinion for a future Bayesian randomised controlled trial for a rare inflammatory paediatric disease, polyarteritis nodosa (MYPAN, Mycophenolate mofetil for polyarteritis nodosa). Methods A Bayesian prior elicitation meeting was convened. Opinion was sought on the probability that a patient in the MYPAN trial treated with cyclophosphamide would achieve disease remission within 6-months, and on the relative efficacies of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide. Expert opinion was combined with previously unseen data from a recently completed randomised controlled trial in ANCA associated vasculitis. Results A pan-European group of fifteen experts participated in the elicitation meeting. Consensus expert prior opinion was that the most likely rates of disease remission within 6 months on cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil were 74\% and 71\%, respectively. This prior opinion will now be taken forward and will be modified to formulate a Bayesian posterior opinion once the MYPAN trial data from 40 patients randomised 1:1 to either CYC or MMF become available.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the perceptions of architects in relation to the challenges of building energy efficiency in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach From a review of pertinent literature 18 factors were identified as challenging. Empirical investigation was carried out using survey questionnaire. The consideration of overlapping aspects of the study largely motivated the use of factor analysis to analyse the data which made it possible to make scientific deductions and built explanations from the results. Findings The study derives five brands of uncorrelated variables that better explains challenges faced in implementing building energy efficiency in Ghana. These variables include financial barriers, information barrier, private sector participation, behavioural barriers and production barrier. The study provides insight on the contextual provision of realities faced in implementing building energy efficiency in Ghana.

	abstract = {Designing sustainable and resilient buildings is a complex process involving multiple actors and numerous, often conflicting, criteria to describe the social, environmental, and economic consequences of design decisions. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a well-established branch of systematic decision science that may be used to narrow the choice set and balance decision criteria and objectives. MCDM methods rely on eliciting decision makers’ (DM) criteria preferences through surveys—a critical, but often time-consuming and expensive process. This study compares two survey methods—Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique and Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives—used to capture DM’s preferences for subjective criteria relevant to the design of resilient and sustainable buildings. Significant differences were found between the results of the two methods, indicating that building design criteria are evaluated differently in different contexts. However, most DMs reported that both surveys accurately captured their preferences, complicating conclusions about DM’s actual preferences through single surveys. The design professionals surveyed also report lower cognitive load for the direct weighting method. Although this study does not report a preferred survey method, the findings suggest that great care must be taken when eliciting DM preferences, and when attempting to apply MCDM to building design decisions.},

I examine three houses central to the history of solar energy and its possible futures: the George O. Löf House (Denver, CO, 1957); the Douglass Kelbaough House (Princeton, NJ, 1974), and the Saskatchewan Conservation House (Regina, Saskatchewan, 1977) in order to assess the cultural and technical changes they elicited.
            At stake in reconsidering the distinction between active and passive solar energy is an attempt to understand how we experience simultaneously the resource conditions of our thermal interiors and the transformations of global climatic patterns. Which is to say, reconsidering active and passive in solar architecture (with heat storage as the hinge) also reconsiders the role of buildings in the production of the carbon zero future—less, at least relatively, as spaces of technological innovation, and more as spaces of social and species evolution. An active passive solar architecture aspires to lifestyles, habits, and expectations coming into line with the massive geophysical transformation of climate instability. By emphasizing the contingency of the built environment and of means of inhabitation, the solar house becomes a medium for epochal social change.},

Major problems accounting for low adoption rates despite well-established benefits are: lack of information or information in unsuitable and usable format for decision making by homeowners. Despite the important role of expert knowledge in developing such systems, its elicitation has been fraught with challenges. Design/methodology/approach Using extensive literature review and a Delphi-dominated data collection technique, the relevant knowledge of 19 industry experts, selected based on previously developed determinants of expert knowledge and suitable for decision making was elicited and compiled.

	abstract = {Biophotovoltaics is a relatively new discipline in microbial fuel cell research. The basic idea is the conversion of light energy into electrical energy using photosynthetic microorganisms. The microbes will use their photosynthetic apparatus and the incoming light to split the water molecule. The generated protons and electrons are harvested using a bioelectrochemical system. The key challenge is the extraction of electrons from the microbial electron transport chains into a solid-state anode. On the cathode, a corresponding electrochemical counter reaction will consume the protons and electrons, e.g., through the oxygen reduction to water, or hydrogen formation. In this review, we are aiming to summarize the current state of the art and point out some limitations. We put a speciﬁc emphasis on cyanobacteria, as these microbes are considered future workhorses for photobiotechnology and are currently the most widely applied microbes in biophotovoltaics research. Current progress in biophotovoltaics is limited by very low current outputs of the devices while a lack of comparability and standardization of the experimental set-up hinders a systematic optimization of the systems. Nevertheless, the fundamental questions of redox homeostasis in photoautotrophs and the potential to directly harvest light energy from a highly efﬁcient photosystem, rather than through oxidation of inefﬁciently produced biomass are highly relevant aspects of biophotovoltaics.},

As part of the EU’s 2020 targets, it is aimed to reach a 20\% share of renewable energy sources in ﬁnal energy consumption by 2020, according to EU’s renewable energy directive. Within this context national renewable energy targets were set for each EU country ranging between 10\% (for Malta) and 49\% (for Sweden). A large share of renewable energy research has been devoted to photovoltaic systems which harness the solar energy to generate electrical power. As an application of the PV technology, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems have attracted an increasing interest in the past decade, and have been shown as a feasible renewable power generation technology to help buildings partially meet their load. In addition to BIPV, building integrated photovoltaic/thermal systems (BIPV/T) provide a very good potential for integration into the building to supply both electrical and thermal loads.},

To alleviate enhanced temperature from both BIPV and BAPV, active and passive cooling can be introduced, however passive techniques are inﬂuential in trimming down the temperature for retroﬁt building.

The hydrophobic (icephobic) self-cleaning coating is suited for snow covering PV while hydrophobic and hydrophilic are both applicable for anti-soiling.

	abstract = {The design of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) often involves complex geometries, non-uniform irradiance conditions and partial shading. This can lead to high energy losses if not considered adequately. This paper presents a BIPV modeling and optimization method which uses a parametric 3D modeling tool, coupled to a high-resolution ray-tracing irradiance simulation and an electrical model based on the single diode model on a subcell level. With the use of a genetic algorithm, electrical interconnections of the modules are optimized for maximum yield. The presented approach allows the simulation and optimization of BIPV in urban environments where complex shading occurs and high electrical mismatch of photovoltaic cells and modules is to be expected. It allows specific geometric design and optimization of photovoltaic installations and their electrical layout. The electrical simulation is validated for both flat and curved thin-film CIGS modules, as well as for two connected thin-film CIGS modules under deferring irradiance and partial shading conditions. The presented method is further applied in a case study on a double-curved roof shell. The results show that by using genetic algorithms the layout can be optimized to minimize the string mismatch losses for BIPV networks with a variety of modules. The detailed electrical simulation allows to quantify effects of module designs and inverter concepts on the system performance. This is demonstrated for the case study, indicating that thin-film modules with longitudinal cell direction outperform modules with orthogonal cell direction by up to 8\%. Furthermore, module-integrated bypass diodes show little benefits for the best performing module technologies. Post-processing the results allows the evaluation of annual, seasonal, daily and hourly losses on a highly disaggregated level.},

To further support knowledge transfer and foster the design with solar materials in the built environment, we present an early design stage framework for thermal and electrical activation of building envelopes with solar materials.

	abstract = {Indoor air quality typically encompasses the ambient conditions inside buildings and public facilities that may affect both the mental and respiratory health of an individual. Until the COVID-19 outbreak, indoor air quality monitoring was not a focus area for public facilities such as shopping complexes, hospitals, banks, restaurants, educational institutes, and so forth. However, the rapid spread of this virus and its consequent detrimental impacts have brought indoor air quality into the spotlight. In contrast to outdoor air, indoor air is recycled constantly causing it to trap and build up pollutants, which may facilitate the transmission of virus. There are several monitoring solutions which are available commercially, a typical system monitors the air quality using gas and particle sensors. These sensor readings are compared against well known thresholds, subsequently generating alarms when thresholds are violated. However, these systems do not predict the quality of air for future instances, which holds paramount importance for taking timely preemptive actions, especially for COVID-19 actual and potential patients as well as people suffering from acute pulmonary disorders and other health problems. In this regard, we have proposed an indoor air quality monitoring and prediction solution based on the latest Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning capabilities, providing a platform to measure numerous indoor contaminants. For this purpose, an IoT node consisting of several sensors for 8 pollutants including NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, PM 2.5 along with the ambient temperature \&amp; air humidity is developed. For proof of concept and research purposes, the IoT node is deployed inside a research lab to acquire indoor air data. The proposed system has the capability of reporting the air conditions in real-time to a web portal and mobile app through GSM/WiFi technology and generates alerts after detecting anomalies in the air quality. In order to classify the indoor air quality, several machine learning algorithms have been applied to the recorded data, where the Neural Network (NN) model outperformed all others with an accuracy of 99.1\%. For predicting the concentration of each air pollutant and thereafter predicting the overall quality of an indoor environment, Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is applied. This model has shown promising results for predicting the air pollutants\&rsquo; concentration as well as the overall air quality with an accuracy of 99.37\%, precision of 99\%, recall of 98\%, and F1-score of 99\%. The proposed solution offers several advantages including remote monitoring, ease of scalability, real-time status of ambient conditions, and portable hardware, and so forth.},

	abstract = {The cost of nosocomial infections in the United States is estimated to be \$4 billion to \$5 billion annually. Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design, i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.},

The results demonstrated that the location of an infected patient would affect the infection risks to other occupants and healthcare workers inside the same hospital ward, and an increased air change rate in the ward could reduce the risk of infection from direct contact and inhalation. It was found that an air change rate of 9 h−1 could effectively minimize the deposition and floating time of respiratory virus particles while maximizing energy efficiency. This study should provide a useful source of reference for the hospital management to mitigate the risk of infection with MERS or other airborne transmitted viruses through better ventilation design strategies.},

	abstract = {Current indoor air quality (IAQ) guidelines in school buildings are framed around thermal conditions, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and corresponding ventilation rates without considering specific indoor pollution levels. Drawing on detailed monitoring data from a sample of 18 classrooms from six London schools, the aim of this paper is to highlight behavioural and environmental factors that affect pollution levels in classrooms, and evaluate the adequacy of CO2 as an overall predictor for IAQ using multilevel modelling. Together with elimination of indoor emission sources, keeping the temperatures below 26℃, and preferably below 22℃ depending on season, may limit total volatile organic compounds below thresholds associated with sensory irritations. The models suggested that after removing dust reservoirs from the classrooms, lowering average indoor CO2 levels below 1000 ppm by increasing ventilation rates can limit indoor airborne particulate matter concentrations below recommended annual WHO 2010 guidelines. Uncontrolled infiltration rates may increase indoor NO2 levels and microbial counts of fungal and bacterial groups, whose presence is associated with wet and moist materials. Overall, indoor CO2 levels were a useful proxy for indoor investigations as they can prevent overheating, dilute pollutants with indoor sources and purge concentrations of airborne particles; however, they were a poor predictor of traffic related pollutants. Practical implications of the findings on the UK policy and building design industry are discussed., Practical application: Driven by the growing population, and many years of intensive use, the UK building stock is in need of rapid expanding, extensive refurbishment and maintenance. However, local authorities lack the money for comprehensive and specialist renovations. The recommendations presented in this paper take into account specific needs and possibilities, and target building designers, engineers and occupants involved with daily operation and management of school buildings. Timely control of ventilation and heating systems, informed selection of construction materials, interior finishing and elimination of indoor sources may improve IAQ of school classrooms.},

A 7h day in a UK school classroom is used as a reference scenario because its geometry, building services, and occupancy have uniformity and are regulated. The REI is used to highlight types of indoor space, respiratory activity, ventilation provision and other factors that increase the likelihood of far field ({\textgreater}2 m) exposure. The classroom reference scenario and an 8h day in a 20 person office both have an REI≃1 and so are a suitable for comparison with other scenarios. A poorly ventilated classroom (1.2ls−1per person) has REI{\textgreater}2 suggesting that ventilation should be monitored in classrooms to minimise far field aerosol exposure risk. Scenarios involving high aerobic activities or singing have REI{\textgreater}1; a 1h gym visit has a median REI=1.4, and the Skagit Choir superspreading event has REI{\textgreater}12. Spaces with occupancy activities and exposure times comparable to those of the reference scenario must preserve the reference scenario volume flow rate as a minimum rate to achieve REI=1, irrespective of the number of occupants present.},

A full-scale experiment using Bacillus subtilis and computational fluid dynamics were utilized to model the bioaerosol characteristics in a two-bed hospital ward with a constant air change rate (12 ACH). The results indicated that the bioaerosol removal efficiency of unilateral downward ventilation was 50\% higher than that of bilateral downward ventilation. Additionally, health care workers (HCWs) and nearby patients had lower breathing zone concentrations in the ward with unilateral downward ventilation. Furthermore, a partition played a positive role in protecting patients by reducing the amount of bioaerosol exposure. However, no obvious protective effect was observed with respect to the HCWs. Only 10\% of the bioaerosol was deposited on the surfaces in the ward with unilateral downward ventilation, while up to 35\% of the bioaerosol was deposited on the surfaces in the ward with bilateral downward ventilation during the 900 s. The main deposition locations of the bioaerosols were near the wall on the same side of the room as the patient's head in all cases.

The aim here is to recommend effective guidelinesfor the control and management of hospital IAQ. Material/Methods: The authors have done an extensiveliterature review and conducted comprehensive IAQ assessments in nine hospitals. It is noted that theIAQ measurements are not presented in this paper because of confidentiality. However, the IAQ analysiswas studied carefully in the development of the recommendations given in this paper. Results: The airbornechemical and microbiological contaminants of concern for hospitals have been identified and the majoremission sources, monitoring methods, and exposure limits have been well documented and are reviewedhere. Proper engineering system designs and operations are also reviewed, with recommendations for effectivedilution and removal of the contaminants. The control and mitigation measures cover mechanical ventilation,filtration, differential pressure control, directional airflow control, local exhaust ventilation, andultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) disinfection. Their applications in critical environments,such as operating theatres, isolation rooms, and other typical units, such as outpatient departmentsand laboratories, are also considered. Conclusions: Effective IAQ monitoring methods and mitigation measuressuitable for the hospital environment have been identified. Accordingly, strategies for the implementationof a hospital indoor air quality management system are recommended. Healthcare workers, hospital engineers,and administrative staff can use the above as guidelines to manage and run their hospitals with healthfulindoor air quality.},

	abstract = {The cost of nosocomial infections in the United States is estimated to be \$4 billion to \$5 billion annually. Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design, i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.},

	abstract = {Research indicates that staff wellbeing, productivity and satisfaction are linked with a hospital's physical environment, in particular the aspects that are determined during early design stages of a building's lifecycle. Incorporating healthcare providers' perspectives during the design of a facility is, therefore, essential to create an effective therapeutic environment. Past research on physical environments in hospitals focused mostly on user satisfaction and was linked with service delivery in a specific setting. Research findings seldom provided useful insights into user perspectives on design related aspects that had the potential to affect their interaction with the environment. This research was aimed at filling this gap by exploring healthcare providers' perception of physical environment design factors in hospitals. A 16-item questionnaire was used to gather perspectives of nurses, doctors and administrative staff in two Chinese hospitals, with a response rate of 77.3\% (N = 304). Descriptive, principal component analysis and statistical tests were applied on the responses to investigate the relationship between perceptions of design factors and demographic and work related variables. Three principal components were identified, namely spatial, maintenance and environmental design. The identified components had good correspondence with previous research on behavioral and environmental psychology. Female healthcare providers were found to be more perceptive about factors related to sensory environments such as visual, acoustic and olfactory, compared to their male counterparts. The working pattern and length of service had associations with perceptions of maintenance and environmental design factors. Respondents ranked abstract and more subjective design factors such as aesthetics and the presence of coordinated art objects lower than the factors generally associated with the safe and efficient delivery of service.},

Consequently, the structural system should be a primary target for reducing the embodied carbon and energy of a building. Parking garages offer an ideal case study for comparing the embodied carbon and energy of different structural systems. As parking garages have little operational energy use and have few materials or systems, the embodied carbon and energy of the structure comprises a majority of the environmental impacts during its life-cycle. This study uses manual material take-offs from construction documents of four parking garages with one-way spans; one pre-cast concrete, one post-tensioned concrete, one cellular steel and one mass timber. The resulting comparison shows that there is little difference in the embodied carbon and energy of structural systems used for parking garages under best material practices. Mass timber, while more viable in a worst-practices scenario, loses its advantages when cement replacement and high recycled content steel are utilized.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Can thermal retrofit measures also enhance summer heat resilience and climate justice? Two common building types of multifamily dwellings in Central Europe are investigated: the ‘Gründerzeithaus’ and post-war large-panel construction along with their different inhabitant demographics. Thermal simulations and demographic surveys were undertaken for dwellings in both building types to evaluate the effectiveness of retrofit measures in reducing winter heat demand and to understand the impacts on summer overheating. Results indicate that standard retrofitting measures can reduce the overheating risks. The high summer temperatures on the top floor can be significantly lowered to values comparable with the ground floor. The remaining overheating in highly exposed rooms is reduced by additional selective adaptation measures. Adaptation requires more than technical interventions. Demographic surveys conducted for both building types show that different social groups are affected. The economics of retrofit requires policy clarity to avoid placing additional burdens on economically disadvantaged people. Inhabitants’ active involvement in night-time ventilation are vital for avoiding overheating. Appropriate affordances and a clear guidance for manual window opening/closing can reduce overheating. However, inhabitants who are unable to act (e.g. the elderly, immobile or those with chronic diseases) will be increasingly vulnerable and disadvantaged by increased exposure to overheating.

 

Practice relevance
The existing approaches for reducing heating demand and their impacts on overheating are examined for two common building types in Central Europe: the Gründerzeithaus and post-war large-panel multifamily housing. The evidence of physical effects and social interdependencies provides a basis both for decision-makers to select suitable measures, and for inhabitants to apply appropriate behavioural practices. Thermal retrofitting strategies for reducing winter heating demand can lead to enhanced resilience to hot summer weather, but also entail inhabitants’ active involvement. Additional technical measures are needed to ensure reduced levels of overheating. Inhabitants’ practices have a significant influence on resilience and the reduction of overheating. Therefore, technical interventions must be accompanied by clear strategies to empower inhabitants to control internal temperatures using natural ventilation. Elderly or ill inhabitants may not be able to perform these practices and, therefore, remain vulnerable. Increased rents caused by retrofits may displace socially disadvantaged inhabitants.},

	abstract = {A consensus is forming among experts that the best way to achieve emissions’ reduction in the near and mid-term is increasing the demand-side energy efficiency—this is especially true in developing countries where the potential for demand reduction is significant and achievable at relatively lower cost. Enhanced energy efficiency also reduces energy costs and can result in a financial benefit to end-users, if the life-cycle value of energy savings offsets the upfront cost of implementing the measure. At the same time, reducing energy demand translates into lower pull for fossil fuel import and supply/distribution capacity expansion. An ideal candidate for the implementation of demand-side energy efficiency measures is the building sector, since it contributes to a large extent to the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted worldwide. In most developing countries, the contribution of the building sector to the total national GHG emissions is significantly higher than the worldwide average. This is in part due to the lower level of industrial activity. Other drivers of the high emissions of the building sector are the inefficiency of the envelope and technical systems of the existing buildings, as well as harsh climatic conditions requiring the use of energy intensive air-conditioning equipment. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) currently have the highest ecological footprint per capita in the world. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the focus of this study, can be expected to have a footprint that is even higher, being the largest economy and the major oil producer among the seven Emirates. In addition to the environmental consequences of unrestrained energy consumption, the fact that energy prices are heavily subsidized in  Abu Dhabi results in a significant financial burden for the government. In the UAE and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the air-conditioning load in buildings is the ideal target for  demand-side management because it constitutes more than 60\% of the total energy consumption. However, many sources of uncertainty still remain. How should we assess the life-cycle cost/benefit of candidate demand-side interventions? Which ones to choose in order to maximize national utility? This study will start to answer those questions by using a detailed engineering model of a typical Abu Dhabi building as specified by the Emirate’s Urban Planning Council. Using the model building as a baseline, we then proceed to evaluate the energy impact of different retrofits through numerical simulation. We present a novel Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) for the Emirate of  Abu Dhabi focusing exclusively on demand-side measures having an impact on the  air-conditioning load. A surprising number of the abatement levers analyzed in this study exhibit a positive net present value (NPV), if the cost-reflective price of electricity is used for the life-cycle assessment.},

This detailed characterization facilitates the assessment of potential energy efficiency measures at the neighborhood and city district scales. In a novel approach we integrated existing methods in urban and energy planning domains such as spatial analysis, dynamic building energy modeling and energy mapping to provide a comprehensive, multi-scale and multi-dimensional model of analysis.

	abstract = {Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems contribute significantly to operational energy and CO2e emissions during the service life of office buildings. Over the last decade, stringent energy codes have enabled the introduction of new HVAC technologies to reduce operational CO2e emissions. However, life cycle carbon emissions of buildings are odivided into operational carbon (OC) and embodied carbon (EC). Operational carbon are the CO2e emissions generated from the burning of fossil fuels used to heat, cool and power the building space during its service life, while EC encompasses the CO2e emissions equivalent to producing, procuring, installing, mantaining, repairing and disposing of the materials and components that make up the building. Over the last decade, broad efforts have improved the understanding of the role that HVAC system selection play in overall OC, nevertheless, EC of HVAC has remained unexamined This paper aims to identify typical HVAC systems used in office building design in Washington State and explore the effects of current practice on total energy use, operational and embodied CO2e. The study sample is composed of twenty office buildings in Washington State registered under the LEED v3 2009 version, from which 15 have obtained LEED certification in the last two years. The projects are registered under the New Construction (NC), Core and Shell (CS), Existing Buildings and Operation and Maintenance (EB:OM) and Commercial Interiors (CI) products and comply with the requirements established in the ASHRAE 90.1-2007 energy standard. The results show that typical HVAC system selection is often a combination of different technologies for ventilation, heating and cooling, and that in general: smaller buildings tend to incorporate high efficiency packaged units while medium and large size buildings typically rely on High Performance Variable Air Volume (HPVAV) systems or hydronic systems such as chilled beams and water source heat pumps (WSHP). The results also indicate that data available through the LEED v3 2009 documentation system on embodied carbon of the mechanical systems is limited and that simplified methods to assess embodied carbon of HVAC are needed in order to integrate EC into whole life assessment of Mechanical Systems.},

	abstract = {Key questions that scientists and engineers typically want to address can be formulated in terms of predictive science. Questions such as: “How well does my computational model represent reality?”, “What are the most important parameters in the problem?”, and “What is the best next experiment to perform?” are fundamental in solving scientiﬁc problems. mystic is a framework for massively-parallel optimization and rigorous sensitivity analysis that enables these motivating questions to be addressed quantitatively as global optimization problems. Often realistic physics, engineering, and materials models may have hundreds of input parameters, hundreds of constraints, and may require execution times of seconds or longer. In more extreme cases, realistic models may be multi-scale, and require the use of high-performance computing clusters for their evaluation. Predictive calculations, formulated as a global optimization over a potential surface in design parameter space, may require an already prohibitively large simulation to be performed hundreds, if not thousands, of times. The need to prepare, schedule, and monitor thousands of model evaluations, and dynamically explore and analyze results, is a challenging problem that requires a software infrastructure capable of distributing and managing computations on large-scale heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we present the design behind an optimization framework, and also a framework for heterogeneous computing, that when utilized together, can make computationally intractable sensitivity and optimization problems much more tractable. The optimization framework provides global search algorithms that have been extended to parallel, where evaluations of the model can be distributed to appropriate large-scale resources, while the optimizer centrally manages their interactions and navigates the objective function. New methods have been developed for imposing and solving constraints that aid in reducing the size and complexity of the optimization problem. Additionally, new algorithms have been developed that launch multiple optimizers in parallel, thus allowing highly efﬁcient local search algorithms to provide fast global optimization. In this way, parallelism in optimization also can allow us to not only ﬁnd global minima, but to simultaneously ﬁnd all local minima and transition points -- thus providing a much more efﬁcient means of mapping out a potential energy surface.},

	abstract = {As drivers of climate action, cities are taking measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which if left unabated pose a challenge to meeting long-term climate targets. The economics of climate action needs to be at the forefront of climate dialogue to prioritize investments among competing mitigation measures. A marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve is an effective visualization of climate action that initiates a technical and economic discussion of the cost-effectiveness and abatement potential of such actions among local leaders, policy makers, and climate experts. More commonly demonstrated for countries, MAC curves need to be developed for cities because of their heterogeneity, which vary in their urban activities, energy supply, infrastructure stock, and commuting patterns. The methodology for constructing bottom-up MAC curves for cities is presented for technologies that offer fuel switching and/or energy efficiencies, while considering technology lifetimes, city-specific electricity and fuel prices, and emission intensities. Resulting MAC curves are unique to every city, and chart the pathway towards low-carbon growth by prioritizing measures based on cost-effectiveness. A case study of Toronto’s climate targets demonstrates the prioritization of select technologies. Leveraging MAC curves to support climate programs enables cities to strategically invest in financing climate action and designing incentives.},

	abstract = {Hurricane Harvey is one of the costliest tropical cyclones in history. In this paper, we use a probabilistic event attribution framework to estimate the costs associated with Hurricane Harvey that are attributable to anthropogenic influence on the climate system. Results indicate that the “fraction of attributable risk” for the rainfall from Harvey was likely about at least a third with a preferable/best estimate of three quarters. With an average estimate of damages from Harvey assessed at about US\$90bn, applying this fraction gives a best estimate of US\$67bn, with a likely lower bound of at least US\$30bn, of these damages that are attributable to the human influence on climate. This “bottom-up” event-based estimate of climate change damages contrasts sharply with the more “top-down” approach using integrated assessment models (IAMs) or global macroeconometric estimates: one IAM estimates annual climate change damages in the USA to be in the region of US\$21.3bn. While the two approaches are not easily comparable, it is noteworthy that our “bottom-up” results estimate that one single extreme weather event contributes more to climate change damages in the USA than an entire year by the “top-down” method. Given that the “top-down” approach, at best, parameterizes but does not resolve the effects of extreme weather events, our findings suggest that the “bottom-up” approach is a useful avenue to pursue in future attempts to refine estimates of climate change damages.},

We calculate these using previously collected information about the damages and losses associated with past floods and droughts, and estimates of the “fraction of attributable risk” that characterizes each event. The estimates we obtain are not comprehensive, and almost certainly represent an underestimate of the full economic costs of climate change, notably chronic costs associated with long-term trends. However, the paper shows the potential for developing a new stream of information that is relevant to a range of stakeholders and research communities, especially those with an interest in the aggregation of the costs of climate change or the identification of specific costs associated with potential liability.},

	abstract = {As efforts to address climate change shift to action at local scales, municipalities are called upon to develop locally specific action plans. Many municipalities lack the resources to develop energy and emissions-reducing policy interventions appropriate to their characteristics. This research synthesises urban form, scenario analysis and energy simulation into a cohesive workflow for evaluating energy and emissions policy interventions across a range of urban forms. A geospatial and census analysis of six cities across British Columbia, Canada, led to the development of seven urban neighborhood patterns. These represent neighborhood forms and densities found in cities of various sizes, densities, forms and climates. To test the approach of an urban built environment model (UBEM), retrofit and infill redevelopment ‘what-if’ scenarios were applied iteratively to two sample patterns comparing the relative efficacy of building technology-improvement policies versus land-use intensification policies. The future ‘what-if’ policy scenarios were spatially tested and validated using relevant policy. The simplified UBEM methods applied to typical patterns and development demonstrates a step towards an accessible and flexible modeling approach. Small and medium-sized municipalities can use this approach to assess and compare potential energy and emissions policy options and outcomes at building and neighborhood scales.

 

Practice relevance
A new, simple method has been created for municipalities to understand multiple ‘what-if’ scenarios for reducing energy demand and emissions from buildings. This is based on profiles from census data, geospatial analysis and energy data that characterise urban neighborhood patterns. The approach integrates building-scale and neighborhood-scale energy and greenhouse gas simulations. It can simulate a variety of policy scenarios and strategy interventions in order to show the interactions between and among urban form and retrofit options. This enables planners and decision-makers to compare the relative magnitudes of different interventions at the neighborhood or city level for energy and emissions performance. The model was developed for use by a variety of communities in British Columbia, Canada. There is potential for adapting this method for use in other locations.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about regional and local climate change can inform climate risk assessments and adaptation decisions. However, estimates of future precipitation change at the regional and local level are deeply uncertain for many parts of the world. A novel methodology was developed that uses climate processes and expert elicitation to build narratives of future regional precipitation change. The narratives qualitatively describe physically plausible evolutions of future regional climate substantiated by climate processes. This method is applied to the Indian Summer Monsoon, focusing on the Cauvery River Basin in Karnataka, Southern India. Six climate narratives are constructed as a function of two drivers prioritised by the experts: moisture availability over the Arabian Sea and strength of the low-level westerly ﬂow. The narratives describe how future precipitation could change until the 2050s and which climate processes and anthropogenic factors could inﬂuence this evolution. Analysis using observed (Global Precipitation Climatology Centre) and re-analysis (ERA20 and Interim) data shows the experts’ judgement on key drivers ﬁts well with empirical relationships. The expert elicited drivers explain 70\% of the variance in peak monsoon precipitation (July and August) over the Western Ghats between 1979−2013 (using ERA Interim). The study shows that through expert elicitation, process-based narratives enable climate scientists to characterise and communicate elements of deep uncertainty in future precipitation change. Expert judgment techniques need be more widely applied to characterise uncertainty in regional and local climate change.},

The ensemble combines several gradient boosting on decision tree algorithms and Bayesian logistic regression. In a presented case study, the model is trained on three summers of hourly weather data and indoor air temperature data of a south-facing, naturally-ventilated office in Vancouver, Canada. The model is then used to predict thermal comfort exceedance under a possible climate change scenario. It is found that the ensemble outperforms its individual models in terms of accuracy, precision, and similar metrics. In eight of nine trials using the ensemble to re-assess known history, the ensemble predicts total comfort-exceeding days within a margin of one day. Under the RCP 8.5 global climate change scenario, the model predicts annual comfort-exceeding days will double before the 2050s, by that point exceeding current local thermal comfort compliance guidelines. Future applications of the presented methodology may assist other areas of data-driven forecasting, such as peak energy demand prediction. It may also assist analysis of emerging space cooling solutions such as radiant cooling of free-running buildings.},

	abstract = {The risk of overheating in UK dwellings is predicted to increase due to anthropogenic climate change and local urban climate modification leading to an increased urban heat island effect. Dwelling geometry characteristics such as orientation, aspect, and glazing, and building fabric characteristics such as thermal mass and resistance can influence the risk of overheating. The majority of simulation-based studies have focused on identifying the importance of building characteristics on overheating risk using a small number of weather files, or focus solely on the impact of external temperatures rather than a full set of climatic variables. This study examines the overheating risk in London dwelling archetypes when simulated under different UK climates, both in the present and under ‘hot future’ conditions, with the objective of identifying whether the conclusions drawn from location-specific studies can be generically applied to different cities. Simulations were carried out using the dynamic thermal simulation tool EnergyPlus using 3456 dwelling variants and six different Design Summer Year (DSY) climate files from locations within the UK. In addition, a 2050 Medium Emissions scenario weather file was used to model a particularly hot summer in all locations. The results indicate that weather files can influence the ranking of relative overheating risk between dwelling types, with significant variations in the relative ranking between London, Scotland and the North of England, and the rest of England. These results show that studies examining the overheating risk across the UK need to consider the variability of building performance under regional weather conditions.},

	abstract = {We examine the performance of the two rank order correlation coefficients (Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau) for describing the strength of association between two continuously measured traits. We begin by discussing when these measures should, and should not, be preferred over Pearson's product–moment correlation coefficient on conceptual grounds. For testing the null hypothesis of no monotonic association, our simulation studies found both rank coefficients show similar performance to variants of the Pearson product–moment measure of association, and provide only slightly better performance than Pearson's measure even if the two measured traits are non-normally distributed. Where variants of the Pearson measure are not appropriate, there was no strong reason (based on our results) to select either of our rank-based alternatives over the other for testing the null hypothesis of no monotonic association. Further, our simulation studies indicated that for both rank coefficients there exists at least one method for calculating confidence intervals that supplies results close to the desired level if there are no tied values in the data. In this case, Kendall's coefficient produces consistently narrower confidence intervals, and might thus be preferred on that basis. However, if there are any ties in the data, irrespective of whether the percentage of ties is small or large, Spearman's measure returns values closer to the desired coverage rates, whereas Kendall's results differ more and more from the desired level as the number of ties increases, especially for large correlation values.},

The subject area of this special issue (risk and vulnerability assessments and management of critical infrastructures) might be a good example as are risk management of chemical installations and accident consequence management for nuclear power plants. Decisions with regard to infrastructures functioning and possible malfunctioning must be taken on the basis of predictions of technical and organizational system behaviour. These predictions use mathematical models containing scores of uncertain parameters. Decision makers want to take, and want to be perceived to take, these decisions in a rational manner. The question is, how can this be accomplished in the face of large uncertainties? One available source is experts in the many fields of interest within infrastructures. This paper describes the use of structured expert judgement in a formal manner. The paper refers to the Procedures Guide published by the European Union as EUR 18820. This Procedures Guide addresses two methods for using expert judgements developed at Delft University of Technology. The paired comparisons method is particularly suitable to identify the relative importance of attributes in the risk management arena, while the Classical Model, apt to arrive at subjective probability assessments, is particularly suitable to derive uncertainty distributions over model parameters. Examples will be referred to for further illustration of applications relevant in the field of risk assessment and risk management.},

The ensemble combines several gradient boosting on decision tree algorithms and Bayesian logistic regression. In a presented case study, the model is trained on three summers of hourly weather data and indoor air temperature data of a south-facing, naturally-ventilated office in Vancouver, Canada. The model is then used to predict thermal comfort exceedance under a possible climate change scenario. It is found that the ensemble outperforms its individual models in terms of accuracy, precision, and similar metrics. In eight of nine trials using the ensemble to re-assess known history, the ensemble predicts total comfort-exceeding days within a margin of one day. Under the RCP 8.5 global climate change scenario, the model predicts annual comfort-exceeding days will double before the 2050s, by that point exceeding current local thermal comfort compliance guidelines. Future applications of the presented methodology may assist other areas of data-driven forecasting, such as peak energy demand prediction. It may also assist analysis of emerging space cooling solutions such as radiant cooling of free-running buildings.},

	abstract = {Patterns of future climate and expected extreme conditions are pushing design limits as recognition of climate change and its implication for the built environment increases. There are a number of ways of estimating future climate projections and creating weather files. Obtaining adequate representation of long-term patterns of climate change and extreme conditions is, however, challenging. This work aims at answering two research questions: does a method of generating future weather files for building performance simulation bring advantages that cannot be provided by other methods? And what type of future weather files enable building engineers and designers to more credibly test robustness of their designs against climate change? To answer these two questions, the work provides an overview of the major approaches to create future weather data sets based on the statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate models. A number of weather data sets for Geneva were synthesized and applied to the energy simulation of 16 ASHRAE standard reference buildings, single buildings and their combination to create a virtual neighborhood. Representative weather files are synthesized to account for extreme conditions together with typical climate conditions and investigate their importance in the energy performance of buildings. According to the results, all the methods provide enough information to study the long-term impacts of climate change on average. However, the results also revealed that assessing the energy robustness of buildings only under typical future conditions is not sufficient. Depending on the type of building, the relative change of peak load for cooling demand under near future extreme conditions can still be up to 28.5\% higher compared to typical conditions. It is concluded that only those weather files generated based on dynamical downscaling and that take into consideration both typical and extreme conditions are the most reliable for providing representative boundary conditions to test the energy robustness of buildings under future climate uncertainties. The results for the neighborhood explaining the critical situation that an energy network may face due to increased peak load under extreme climatic conditions. Such critical situations remain unforeseeable by relying solely on typical and observed extreme conditions, putting the climate resilience of buildings and energy systems at risk.},

	abstract = {Sustainable energy technologies are frequently considered for use with buildings in order to reduce their environmental impact. However, each technology will come with its own associated embodied carbon, which might potentially represent a significant proportion of a building's total embodied carbon impact. There is a need for further studies on the embodied carbon or CO2 equivalent (CO2e) impact of sustainable energy technologies and it is important to understand how they contribute to the total CO2e budget of a building. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used for the CO2e calculations and this paper has reviewed a significant number of existing studies. The results show that LCA methodologies can and do present information which has a significant degree of inaccuracy. Furthermore, the impact of some technologies can significantly increase the embodied CO2e impact of modern low to zero energy buildings. Considering the whole life CO2e impact of each aspect of a building is crucial for the successful creation of a truly low to zero carbon building. Many current studies omit the CO2e impact from sustainable energy technologies. This leads to results which are under representative and misleading.},

	abstract = {Most bias correction algorithms used in climatology, for example quantile mapping, are applied to univariate time series. They neglect the dependence between different variables. Those that are multivariate often correct only limited measures of joint dependence, such as Pearson or Spearman rank correlation. Here, an image processing technique designed to transfer colour information from one image to another—the N-dimensional probability density function transform—is adapted for use as a multivariate bias correction algorithm (MBCn) for climate model projections/predictions of multiple climate variables. MBCn is a multivariate generalization of quantile mapping that transfers all aspects of an observed continuous multivariate distribution to the corresponding multivariate distribution of variables from a climate model. When applied to climate model projections, changes in quantiles of each variable between the historical and projection period are also preserved. The MBCn algorithm is demonstrated on three case studies. First, the method is applied to an image processing example with characteristics that mimic a climate projection problem. Second, MBCn is used to correct a suite of 3-hourly surface meteorological variables from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) across a North American domain. Components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, a complicated set of multivariate indices that characterizes the risk of wildfire, are then calculated and verified against observed values. Third, MBCn is used to correct biases in the spatial dependence structure of CanRCM4 precipitation fields. Results are compared against a univariate quantile mapping algorithm, which neglects the dependence between variables, and two multivariate bias correction algorithms, each of which corrects a different form of inter-variable correlation structure. MBCn outperforms these alternatives, often by a large margin, particularly for annual maxima of the FWI distribution and spatiotemporal autocorrelation of precipitation fields.},

It constitutes a practical planning aid on the subject of refurbishment, providing a basic introduction to the relevant aspects of building physics, fire protection, sustainability and energy, hazardous materials, construction materials for interior and façade, historic preservation, and technical building equipment. It offers concrete tips on planning steps, methods of building analysis, and cost benchmarks, as well as clear constructional solutions with built projects as examples. A unique feature of the volume is the specially developed timeline, which allows the planner to quickly grasp, categorize, and evaluate a concrete building task and thus obtain an efficient planning overview. Planungsaufgaben im Bestand gehören derzeit zu den häufigsten Auftragsarten und nahezu jedes Bauwerk stellt andere Anforderungen und weist individuelle Probleme auf. Analog dazu gibt es auf dem Markt eine fast unüberschaubare Anzahl Publikationen in meist sehr spezialisierter Form. Der Sanierungsatlas möchte Licht in diesen Publikationsdschungel bringen: Er definiert Begrifflichkeiten, vereint die fokussierenden Betrachtungsweisen der Fachleute und vermittelt konkrete Herangehensweisen an diese weit gefächerte Thematik. Der Sanierungsatlas schließt die Lücke zwischen grundlegender Baukonstruktions- und sehr einseitig spezialisierter Fachliteratur. Das Buch stellt eine praktische Planungshilfe zum Thema Sanierung dar – und zwar in Form von relevanter Grundlagenvermittlung zu Bauphysik, Brandschutz, Nachhaltigkeits- und energetischen Aspekten, Schadstoffen, Baustoffen im Innenraum und an der Fassade, zu Aspekten der Denkmalpflege ebenso wie zur technischen Gebäudeausstattung. Er liefert konkrete Hinweise zu Planungsschritten, Methoden der Bauanalyse und Kostenkennwerten sowie anschauliche Konstruktionslösungen am Beispiel gebauter Projekte. Einzigartig ist die speziell entwickelte Zeitschiene, mit deren Hilfe eine konkrete Bauaufgabe schnell erfasst, kategorisiert und bewertet werden kann – und die dem Planer somit einen effizienten Planungsüberblick verschafft.},

Following the proven model of earlier manuals in the series, the Energy Manual presents a comprehensive look at the constructional parameters of energy efficiency and sustainability. It offers an advance look at the legal regulations being planned by the EU, and – as a tool ready for immediate use by architects, engineers, and designers in their daily work – it points the way toward the efficient and sustainable construction and operation of buildings. With its focus on the entire lifecycle of a building, it provides an integrated perspective – a necessary prerequisite for sustainable economic management.},

Twenty-one of these office buildings were identified as LEED-certified, providing the opportunity for direct comparison of energy performance data for LEED and non-LEED buildings of the same type, time frame, and geographical and climate region. With regard to energy consumption and GHG emission the LEED-certified buildings, collectively, showed no savings as compared with non-LEED buildings.

The flow patterns which develop are quite realistic, including a jet and zonal surface westerlies in middle latitudes, and the growth of a large disturbance. The associated energy transformations are investigated, and demonstrate the important role of the disturbance in the development of the zonal currents. The meridional circulation is also studied, together with its contribution to the zonal momentum budgets of the lower and upper halves of the atmosphere.

	abstract = {Within the context of amongst others urban energy planning and energy system design, urban and district energy simulations have gained interest to quantify the energy use of existing districts. To reduce calculation time and in absence of adequate detailed building level data, urban energy simulations often deploy reductive modelling approaches based on a limited set of buildings, or archetype buildings. This may lead to significant modelling errors when the archetype buildings are not tailored to the studied location. This paper explores a building clustering approach that harvests available local building information, e.g. geospatial data, to generate a tailored set of archetype buildings. Focussed on simulating the annual heat demand or peak heat demand, this paper evaluates if clustering on building properties can be an alternative to clustering on the energy key performance indicators of interest to define the tailored archetypes. As consumption data on a building level is often not available, such an approach would eliminate the need to simulate the energy use for all buildings. The results show that indeed clustering on the properties is a viable alternative with robust results for both annual energy use and peak energy demand and a comparable accuracy compared to clustering on the targeted performance indicators.},

Nevertheless, most of the existing studies and strategies are based on specific (and often singular) environmental processes, and their efficacy is largely undermined by their heavy dependence on locality. Here we present a novel modeling framework for urban studies to capture spatial connectivity and teleconnection among cities in response to different environmental stressors. For illustration, a generic message-passing-based algorithm is used to identify spatial structures among U.S. cities. Urban structures are analyzed under two types of environmental stressors, i.e., extreme heat and air pollution, based on remotely sensed land surface temperature data during short-term heat wave events and a yearlong remotely sensed aerosol optical depth dataset, respectively. Results show that U.S. cities are clustered as locally and regionally connected groups, while the hub–periphery organization manifest via environmental similarity and atmospheric transport under both event-scale meteorological extremes and long-term environmental stressors. The physics-driven urban agglomeration reveals that cities are multilevel interconnected complex systems rather than isolated entities. The proposed framework provides a new pathway to shift goal- or process-based urban studies to system-based global ones.},

	abstract = {Floods are considered as one of the most frequently occurring natural hazards worldwide and are occurring increasingly frequent in recent decades. Flood risk assessment is an important tool for flood prevention and involves significant practical applications in flood risk management and flood disaster reduction. In the study, an integrated methodology is proposed by incorporating urban flood inundation model, improved entropy weight method and k-means cluster algorithm to evaluate urban flood risk. The proposed approach is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels, and thus provides a more reasonable and objective result. A region in Haikou, China is adopted to test the applicability of the proposed approach. Seven evaluation indices are selected by coupling the natural hazard index system and hydrological models. The index weights are calculated by an improved entropy weight method that integrates the entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Subsequently, the k-means cluster algorithm is used to develop the flood risk map in the study area. The results indicate that high risk zones cover 13.7\% of total area, which generally exhibit higher inundation depth and lower elevations. The assessment result matches well with the historical data of flood events. The traditional cluster algorithm and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods are used for comparison with the improved entropy-cluster algorithm so as to validate the proposed approach for risk management. The result demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible and exhibits the most reasonable classification result. The study outcomes provide a novel approach for flood risk assessment and can provide valuable information for urban flood management.},

	abstract = {To achieve computational efficiency, efforts toward developing urban-scale energy modeling applications frequently rely on various domain simplifications. For instance, heat transfer phenomena are captured using reduced order models. As a consequence, specific aspects pertaining to the temporal dynamics of energy load patterns and their dependency on transient phenomena (e.g., weather conditions, inhabitants’ presence and actions) cannot be realistically represented. To address this circumstance, we have conceived, implemented, and documented a two-step urban energy modeling approach that combines cluster analysis and sampling techniques, full dynamic numeric simulation capability, and stochastic methods. The paper describes the suggested urban energy modeling approach and the embedded cluster analysis supported sampling methodology. More particularly we focus on the aspects of this approach that explicitly involve the representation of inhabitants in urban-scale energy modeling. In this regard, the potential to recover lost dynamic diversity (e.g., in computation of temporal load patterns) due to the deployed reductive sampling is explored. Parametric runs based on stochastic variations of underlying building use profiles facilitate the generation of highly realistic load patterns despite the small number of buildings selected to represent the simulation domain. We illustrate the utility of the proposed urban energy modeling approach to address queries concerning the energy efficiency potential of behaviorally effective instruments. The feasibility of the envisioned scenarios concerning inhabitants and their behavior (high-resolution temporal load prediction, assessment of behavioral variation) is presented in detail via specific instances of district-level energy modeling for the city of Vienna, Austria.},

We hypothesize that the intrinsic characteristics of landscape at the city scale reflect both the local socioeconomic context and the regional trends towards urbanization, possibly representing the contrasting attitude towards suburbanization found in European countries. Using comprehensive information provided by Urban Atlas maps, we propose an exploratory multivariate analysis of eighty-five variables describing land-use composition, landscape structure, and urban form in 283 cities with the aim being to classify the urbanization patterns observed in five European macroregions. Landscape metrics seem to be more powerful in discriminating cities among regions than indicators of land-use composition. The most relevant metrics discriminating among cities are (i) those describing fragmentation processes along the urban gradient and (ii) those evaluating form and patchiness of discontinuous settlements. Landscape and class average patch size and edge density correctly classified cities in more than 80\% of cases. In particular, cities in Southern, Eastern, and Northern Europe were identified as three homogeneous groups as far as landscape structure is concerned, confirming the converging urbanization trends in the Mediterranean countries and the peculiar morphological characteristics of post‑socialist urban areas.},

	abstract = {The present research effort investigates the requirements of an urban energy computing environment, aimed to support strategic decision making with regard to physical and technological interventions as well as behavioral, and contextual changes. Providing an analytical overview of some previous efforts, the present contribution introduces a novel two-step approach toward bottom-up urban energy computing, involving a reductive phase and a re-diversification process. The reductive phase is performed through an automated process within a GIS platform. The developed process utilizes available large-scale data to generated an energy-relevant representation of the urban building stock. A matrix of energy-influential building characteristics, depicted as aggregate descriptive indicators, is computed based on the generated representation and subjected to multivariate cluster analysis methods for stock classification. The resulting classes are represented through typical buildings, which undergo detailed performance simulation computations. The re-diversification process addresses the loss of diversity due to the reductive method, through employment of stochastic occupancy models and model parametrization. This paper reports on the development of the reductive step, illustrating the encountered challenges and the adopted responses.},

	abstract = {Ho Chi Minh City faces significant and growing flood risk. Recent risk reduction efforts may be insufficient as climate and socio-economic conditions diverge from projections made when those efforts were initially planned. This study demonstrates how robust decision making can help Ho Chi Minh City develop integrated flood risk management strategies in the face of such deep uncertainty. Robust decision making is an iterative, quantitative, decision support methodology designed to help policy makers identify strategies that are robust, that is, satisfying decision makers' objectives in many plausible futures, rather than being optimal in any single estimate of the future. This project used robust decision making to analyze flood risk management in Ho Chi Minh City's Nhieu Loc-Thi Nghe canal catchment area. It found that the soon-to-be-completed infrastructure may reduce risk in best estimates of future conditions, but it may not keep risk low in many other plausible futures. Thus, the infrastructure may not be sufficiently robust. The analysis further suggests that adaptation and retreat measures, particularly when used adaptively, can play an important role in reducing this risk. The study examines the conditions under which robust decision making concepts and full robust decision making analyses may prove useful in developing countries. It finds that planning efforts in developing countries should at minimum use models and data to evaluate their decisions under a wide range of conditions. Full robust decision making analyses can also augment existing planning efforts in numerous ways.},

	abstract = {The accurate prediction of building indoor overheating risk is critical in order to mitigate its possible consequences on occupant health and wellbeing. The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers issued Technical Memorandum 59 (TM59) with the aim of achieving consistency in the modelling processes followed for the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. However, as each tool’s prediction may depend on its inherent assumptions, an inter-model comparison procedure was used to assess whether the choice of building performance simulation tool inﬂuences the overheating assessment. The predictions of two popular tools, IES VE and EnergyPlus, were compared for nine variations of a naturally ventilated, purpose built, London ﬂat archetype, modelled under the default algorithm options. EnergyPlus predicted a high overheating risk according to TM59 criteria in seven out of the nine model variants, contrary to the low risk of all the IES VE variants. Analysis of heat transfer processes revealed that wind-driven ventilation and surface convection algorithms were the main sources of the observed discrepancies. The choice of simulation tool could thus inﬂuence the overheating risk assessment in ﬂats while the observed discrepancies in the simulation of air and heat transfer could have implications on other modelling applications.},

	abstract = {Increasing the energy efficiency of the built environment has become a priority worldwide and especially in Europe. Because of the relatively low turnover rate of the existing built environment, energy efficiency retrofitting appears to be a fundamental step in reducing its energy consumption. Last experiences have shown that there is a vast energy efficiency potential lying in the building stock, and it is mainly untapped. One of the reasons is a lack of robust methodologies able to evaluate the effect of applied energy efficiency measures and inform about the expected impact of potential retrofitting strategies. Nowadays, dynamic measured data coming from automated metering infrastructure provides valuable information to evaluate the effect of energy conservation strategies. For this reason, energy performance modeling and assessment methods based on this data are starting to play a major role. In this paper, several methodologies for the measurement and verification of energy savings, and for the prediction and recommendation of energy retrofitting strategies, are analysed in detail. Practitioners looking at different options for these two processes, will find in this review a thorough and detailed overview of the different methods that can be used. Guidance is also provided to determine which method could work best depending on the specific case under analysis. The reviewed approaches include statistical learning models, machine learning models, Bayesian methods, deterministic approaches, and hybrid techniques that combine deterministic and data-driven modeling. Existing research gaps are identified and prospects for future investigation are presented within the main conclusions of this research work.},

Accurate energy forecasting models have numerous implications in planning and energy optimization of buildings and campuses. For new buildings, where past recorded data is unavailable, computer simulation methods are used for energy analysis and forecasting future scenarios. However, for existing buildings with historically recorded time series energy data, statistical and machine learning techniques have proved to be more accurate and quick. This study presents a comprehensive review of the existing machine learning techniques for forecasting time series energy consumption. Although the emphasis is given to a single time series data analysis, the review is not just limited to it since energy data is often co-analyzed with other time series variables like outdoor weather and indoor environmental conditions. The nine most popular forecasting techniques that are based on the machine learning platform are analyzed. An in-depth review and analysis of the ‘hybrid model’, that combines two or more forecasting techniques is also presented. The various combinations of the hybrid model are found to be the most effective in time series energy forecasting for building.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption models play an integral part in energy management and conservation, as it pertains to buildings. It can assist in evaluating building energy efficiency, in carrying out building commissioning, and in identifying and diagnosing building system faults. This review takes an in-depth look at energy-demand prediction models for buildings in that it delves into recent developments in building energy approaches used to predict energy usage. By enlisting current approaches to the modelling of buildings, methods for building energy simulations can be categorized into four level classes as follows: (i) data-driven approaches; (ii) physics-based approaches; (iii) large scale building energy forecasting approaches; and (iv) hybrid approaches. The focus of this review is to target the data-driven approach and large-scale building energy predicting-based approaches. Here the data driven approaches can be categorized by (1) artificial neural network based approaches; (2) clustering based approaches; (3) statistical and machine learning-based approaches; and (4) support vector machine based approaches. From there, the type of data-driven based approach is further grouped by (a) benchmarking models; (b) energy-mapping models; (c) energy forecasting models; and (d) energy profiling models. Large-scale building-energy prediction techniques is then categorized as follows: (1) white-box based approaches; (2) black-box based approaches, and (3) grey-box based approaches. The current study explores first-rate data-driven based approaches about building energy analysis for industrial, commercial, domestic, etc., within a rural and urban setting. This review paper is based on the necessity of identifying points of departure and research opportunities for urban and rural-level analyses of building level energy performance. A variety of issues are explored which include: energy performance metrics; end-use of different building types; multiple levels of granularity; and urban and rural scales. Each technique encompasses a variety of input information as well as varying calculations or simulation models along with furnishing contrasting outcomes that suggest a variety of usages. A thorough review of each technique is presented in this study. This review highlights strengths, shortcomings, and purpose of the methods of numerous data-mining based approaches. A comprehensive review of energy forecasting models that are specified in the literature part is also provided.},

Energy performance of building is complicated since it depends on multiple variables associated to the building characteristics, equipment and systems, weather, occupants, and sociological influences. This paper aims to provide an up-to-date review on the basics of building energy estimation. Regarding models, a classification for energy estimation models is proposed based on the different classifications found in the literature review. The paper focuses on models developed with whole building energy simulation software and their validation. This focus is justified because of the importance that whole building energy tools have gained on areas such as green building design, and analysis of energy conservation strategies and retrofits.

Therefore, considerable energy savings can be obtained by using proper thickness of insulation in buildings. Given the significant climatic variations that exist in different parts of Turkey, 16 cities from four climate zones of Turkey are selected for analysis and optimum insulation thicknesses, energy savings, and payback periods are calculated. The annual heating requirements of buildings in different climates zones were obtained by means of the heating degree-days concept. The optimization is based on life-cycle cost analysis. Five different fuels; coal, natural gas, fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and electricity, and as an insulation material polystyrene are considered. The results show that optimum insulation thicknesses vary between 2 and 17cm, energy savings between 22\% and 79\%, and payback periods between 1.3 and 4.5 years depending on the city and the type of fuel.},

	abstract = {Using cost–benefit analysis to determine an optimal climate mitigation target is criticised, especially because i) it fails to sufficiently take into account low-probability, high-impact events, and ii) results strongly depend on the discount rate used. One of the alternative suggestions to inform policymakers about the right mitigation target that does take the risks associated with low-probability, high-impact events explicitly into account is the minimax regret criterion. We apply the minimax regret criterion quantitatively using an integrated assessment model with extreme values for climate sensitivity, damage estimates and mitigation costs. The goal is to analyse whether such a method leads to different results compared to standard cost–benefit analysis and whether the results are still sensitive to the discount rate used. We find that the minimax regret approach leads to more stringent and robust climate targets for relatively low discount rates and if both a high climate sensitivity and high damage estimates are assumed. If one of these assumptions does not hold, the difference between the minimax regret approach and standard cost–benefit analysis is much smaller. Therefore, we conclude that the discount rate used can still be of vital importance even when applying a minimax regret approach.},

Building Energy Simulation and Optimization (BESO) is an emerging innovative technique that shows promise but is not yet a widely adopted design practice. To identify the needs, benefits, and hindrances of applying BESO to sustainable building design, particularly passive design, a two-part survey was conducted. A significant amount of attention was dedicated to analyzing the opinions of early adopters. Out of nine potential hindrances of the BESO technique, long calculation time, lack of adequate advertisement, and lack of a standard method or procedure are in the top three. Based on the survey results, a review was conducted to categorize a general procedure for the BESO technique. The application of the BESO technique to passive building design was investigated. The passive design components covered building forms, opaque envelopes, fenestrations, shadings, natural ventilation, and thermal mass materials. The review concludes that the three-phase optimization method was the most widely used method. Currently, compared to other passive design methods, BESO proved to be a more efficient method for helping designers (especially architects) explore various design territories.},

	abstract = {Neglecting extremes and designing buildings for the past or most likely weather conditions is not the best approach for the future. Robust design techniques can, however, be a viable option for tackling future challenges. The concept of robust design was first introduced by Taguchi in the 1940s. The result of the design process is a product that is insensitive to the effect of given sources of variability, even though the sources themselves are not eliminated. A robust design optimization (RDO) method is for the first time proposed in this paper, for supporting architects and engineers in the design of buildings with robust energy performance under climate change and extreme conditions. The simplicity and the low computational demand of the process underlies the feasibility and applicability of this method, which can be used at any stage of the design process. The results show that the performance of the optimum solution not only has a 81.5\% lower variation (less sensitivity to climate uncertainty) but at the same time has a 14.4\% lower mean energy use value compared with a solution that is compliant with a recent construction standard (ASHRAE 90.1-2016). Less sensitivity to climate uncertainty means greater robustness to climate change whilst maintaining high performance.},

Current research regarding the impact of orientation on a building's energy needs seldom tap into the potential of BIM. This study investigates the impact of orientation on energy consumption in small-scale construction, and assesses how BIM can be used to facilitate this process. The methods adopted are three-fold. Firstly, a real-life building is modelled using Revit, one of the leading BIM tools. Secondly, through green building Extensible Markup Language, the model is exported to Green Building Studio, one of the leading energy simulation software. Thirdly, in the Green Building Studio, different building orientations are adopted and their impacts of the whole building energy are investigated. Based on the analysis of the energy consumption corresponding to the different orientations, it emerged that a well-orientated building can save a considerable amount of energy throughout its life cycle. Specifically, a total electricity use difference of 17 056 kWh and a total gas use difference of 27 988 MJ leading to a combined energy cost savings of £878 throughout a 30 year period between the best (+180°) and worst (+45°) orientations of the building was achieved.},

To improve the climate resiliency of existing and new buildings, it is important to evaluate their performance over current and projected future climates. Hygrothermal and whole building simulation models, which are important tools for assessing performance, require continuous climate records at high temporal frequencies of a wide range of climate variables for input into the kinds of models that relate to solar radiation, cloud-cover, wind, humidity, rainfall, temperature, and snow-cover. In this study, climate data that can be used to assess the performance of building envelopes under current and projected future climates, concurrent with 2 \&deg;C and 3.5 \&deg;C increases in global temperatures, are generated for 11 major Canadian cities. The datasets capture the internal variability of the climate as they are comprised of 15 realizations of the future climate generated by dynamically downscaling future projections from the CanESM2 global climate model and thereafter bias-corrected with reference to observations. An assessment of the bias-corrected projections suggests, as a consequence of global warming, future increases in the temperatures and precipitation, and decreases in the snow-cover and wind-speed for all cities.},

Applied behavioural research characterises drivers and barriers to cost-effective renovations, and identifies personal and contextual influences on homeowners’ renovation decisions. Research findings inform policies to promote energy efficiency by removing barriers or strengthening decision influences. Sociological research on domestic life points to limitations in this understanding of renovation decision making that emphasises houses but not homes, energy efficiency but not home improvements, the one-off but not the everyday, and renovations but not renovating. The paper proposes a situated approach in response to this critique. A situated approach retains a focus on renovation decision making, but conceptualises decisions as processes that emerge from the conditions of everyday domestic life and are subject to different levels of influence. This situated approach is tractable for energy efficiency policy while recognising the ultimate influences that explain why homeowners decide to renovate.},

Engineering studies identify several investments in new energy-efficiency equipment or building retrofits that would more than pay for themselves in terms of lower future energy costs, but homeowners and businesses generally do not have good information about how to take advantage of these opportunities. Energy auditors make up a growing industry of professionals who evaluate building energy use and provide this information to building owners. This paper reports the results of a survey of nearly 500 home energy auditors and contractors that Resources for the Future conducted in summer 2011. The survey asked about the characteristics of these businesses and the services they provide, the degree to which homeowners follow up on their recommendations, and the respondents’ opinions on barriers to home energy retrofits and the role for government. Findings from the survey suggest that the audit industry only partially is filling the information gap. Not enough homeowners know about or understand audits, and the follow-through on recommendations once they do have audits is incomplete. But the survey findings suggest that low energy prices and the high cost of retrofits may be more responsible for these outcomes than failures of information.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses an intractable problem: how to energy-upgrade the existing residential housing stock on a large scale, potentially saving up to 30\% of all greenhouse gas emissions? The paper focuses on the USA, with a case study in Worcester, Massachusetts. To address this problem we conceptualise the residential housing stock as a socio-technical system, with as main elements technology, professional knowledge and know-how, formal institutions, markets and the key actors within each. The analysis demonstrates the interconnectedness of the elements and sub-elements of the system, the need to affect change in all of them, identifies homeowners (consumers) and local authorities as the most difficult to change, and suggests that both technological and social innovation – including grassroots activism and multistakeholder collaboration – is needed. We conceptualise housing retrofitting projects as small-scale niche experiments and as grassroots innovations. In this paper we describe an experiment in Worcester, Massachusetts, in which the vision of the project – as community development – was produced by a coalition (WoHEC) of many local actors. This project illustrates both the potentials of our proposed framework in terms of grassroots innovations and socio-technical experiments and its limitations: learning among stakeholders is often slow and ineffective. More research is needed to refine the conceptual framework and to make it applicable to both grassroots innovations and municipal projects.},

	abstract = {General circulation models (GCM) have been used by researchers to assess the effect of climate change in different fields of study. In the case of building energy performance, GCMs can be used to evaluate future building energy performance through simulations. However, a key issue with the use of GCM data in building energy simulation is the inadequate resolution and bias of the data. Therefore, in order to use this data for simulation purposes and better predict future building performance, further processing is required. The first challenge is that the GCMs are usually biased, which means a considerable deviation can be found when the historical GCM data is compared to station observed weather data. The second challenge is that the GCM data has daily temporal resolution rather than the hourly resolution required in building energy simulation. In order to utilize GCM data to estimate future building performance through simulation, the current study suggests a workflow that can be applied to climate change data. First, a bias-correction technique, known as the quantile-quantile method, is applied to remove the bias in the data in order to adapt GCMs to a specific location. The study then uses a hybrid classification-regression model to downscale the bias-corrected GCM data to generate future weather data at an hourly resolution for building energy simulation. In this case, the hybrid model is structured as a combined model, where a classification model serves as the main model together with an auxiliary regression model for cases when data is beyond the range of observed values. The proposed workflow uses observed weather data to determine similar weather patterns from historical data and use it to generate future weather data, contrary to previous studies, which use artificially generated data. However, in cases where the future GCM data showed temperatures ranging outside of the observed data, the study applied a trained regression model to generate hourly weather data. The proposed workflow enables users to generate future weather files year by year under different climate change scenarios and, consequently, extreme weather characteristics are preserved for extreme or reliability analysis and design optimization.},

The authors conducted a comprehensive and critical review to provide a both qualitative and quantitative introduction of POE, including a brief introduction of the history, definition and benefits of POE, a statistical analysis of 146 POE projects since 2010, a comparison of 16 existing POE protocols, a summary of emerging research focuses, and potential future research areas. The 146 POE projects were analyzed in terms of building types, countries, purposes, methods used, and key findings. The review of 16 POE protocols show the state-of-the-practice POE techniques. Apart from POE projects, the authors present emerging research topics related to the visualization of POE results, analyses of occupant survey database, and measurement of occupancy. Finally, the discussion summarizes the current condition of POE research and proposes five transitions that POE efforts should pursue: from one-off to continuing, from high-level to detailed, from researchers-oriented to owners/occupants-oriented, from academia to industry, and from independent to integrated. This paper provides a thorough introduction of POE to the beginners in this area, as well as informing more seasoned investigators about the trends, gaps, and potential future directions in POE research.},

	abstract = {With the increasing demand for more energy efficient buildings, the construction industry is faced with the challenge to ensure that the energy performance predicted during the design stage is achieved once a building is in use. There is, however, significant evidence to suggest that buildings are not performing as well as expected and initiatives such as PROBE and CarbonBuzz aim to illustrate the extent of this so called ‘performance gap’. This paper discusses the underlying causes of discrepancies between energy modelling predictions and in-use performance of occupied buildings (after the twelve month liability period). Many of the causal factors relate to the use of unrealistic input parameters regarding occupancy behaviour and facilities management in building energy models. In turn, this is associated with the lack of feedback to designers once a building has been constructed and occupied. The paper aims to demonstrate how knowledge acquired from Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) can be used to produce more accurate energy performance models. A case study focused specifically on lighting, small power and catering equipment in a high density office building is analysed and presented. Results show that by combining monitoring data with predictive energy modelling, it was possible to increase the accuracy of the model to within 3\% of actual electricity consumption values. Future work will seek to use detailed POE data to develop a set of evidence based benchmarks for energy consumption in office buildings. It is envisioned that these benchmarks will inform designers on the impact of occupancy and management on the actual energy consumption of buildings. Moreover, it should enable the use of more realistic input parameters in energy models, bringing the predicted figures closer to reality.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

	abstract = {We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6–3.9 K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3–4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5–95\% ranges are 2.3–4.7 K, bounded by 2.0–5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

	abstract = {Extreme weather and climate-related events occur in a particular place, by definition, infrequently. It is therefore challenging to detect systematic changes in their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records. However, there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community in the extent to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human-induced climate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies seek to determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability or magnitude of particular events. They have shown clear evidence for human influence having increased the probability of many extremely warm seasonal temperatures and reduced the probability of extremely cold seasonal temperatures in many parts of the world. The evidence for human influence on the probability of extreme precipitation events, droughts, and storms is more mixed. Although the science of event attribution has developed rapidly in recent years, geographical coverage of events remains patchy and based on the interests and capabilities of individual research groups. The development of operational event attribution would allow a more timely and methodical production of attribution assessments than currently obtained on an ad hoc basis. For event attribution assessments to be most useful, remaining scientific uncertainties need to be robustly assessed and the results clearly communicated. This requires the continuing development of methodologies to assess the reliability of event attribution results and further work to understand the potential utility of event attribution for stakeholder groups and decision makers.

Currently, it is unclear how useful this extra spatial resolution will be and it is this question that is addressed here. It is found that for both future and present climate, the spatial variability of the weather is the dominating factor.

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the main characteristics of the RCP8.5 scenario. The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W/m2). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution.},

Global climate models (GCMs), which attempt to represent all relevant physical processes, provide the most direct means of estimating climate sensitivity via CO quadrupling experiments. Here we show that the closely related effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), with values spanning 1.8–5.6 K across 27 GCMs and exceeding 4.5 K in 10 of them. This (statistically insignificant) increase is primarily due to stronger positive cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo. Both of these are tied to the physical representation of clouds which in CMIP6 models lead to weaker responses of extratropical low cloud cover and water content to unforced variations in surface temperature. Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications.},

	abstract = {Logistical constraints can limit the number of global climate model (GCM) simulations considered in a climate change impact assessment. When dealing with annual or seasonal variables, one can visualize and manually select GCM scenarios to cover as much of the ensemble’s range of changes as possible. Most environmental systems are sensitive to climate conditions (e.g., extremes) that cannot be described by a small number of variables. Instead, algorithms like k-means clustering have been used to select representative ensemble members. Clustering algorithms are, however, biased toward high-density regions of climate variable space and tend to select scenarios that describe the central tendency rather than the full spread of an ensemble. Also, scenarios selected via clustering may not be ordered: that is, scenarios in the ﬁve-cluster solution may not appear in the six-cluster solution, which makes recommending a consistent set of scenarios to researchers with different needs difﬁcult. Alternatively, an automated procedure based on a cluster initialization algorithm is proposed and applied to changes in 27 climate extremes indices between 1986–2005 and 2081–2100 from a large ensemble of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations. Selections by the method are ordered and are designed to span the overall range of the ensemble. The number of scenarios required to account for changes spanned by at least 90\% of the CMIP5 ensemble members is reported for 21 regions of the globe and compared with k-means clustering. On average, the proposed method requires 40\% fewer scenarios to meet this threshold than k-means clustering does.},

	abstract = {Since local weather and climate greatly affect the construction and performance of buildings, reliable meteorological data is essential when simulating building performance. It is well understood that climate change will affect future weather and there is a growing interest in generating future weather files to support climate resilient building design. Weather files that account for climate change have not been widely used for the lower mainland region of British Columbia. In this study, hourly weather files for future climate conditions in Vancouver are created for three time periods using a “morphing” methodology. Morphing uses results from global climate models to adjust observed weather data at a specific location. In this study, daily data from climate simulations for the RCP8.5 emission scenario have been used. The weather variables that have been adjusted are dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, cloud cover, wind speed and atmospheric pressure. The impact of climate change on the energy performance of a multi-unit residential building located on the University of BC campus is analyzed using the energy modelling software EnergyPlus. The simulation results indicate that the changing climate in Vancouver, following RCP8.5, would have a considerable effect on building energy performance and energy demand due to decrease in space heating and increase in cooling requirements.},

In order to assess buildings' energy demand across the 21st century, we develop an energy demand model — EDGE — and apply it in an analytical scenario framework — the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) — to take socio-economic uncertainty into consideration. EDGE projects energy demand for five energy services, four fuel categories, and eleven regions covering the world. The analysis shows that, without further climate policies, global final energy demand from buildings could increase from 116 EJ/yr in 2010 to a range of 120–378 EJ/yr in 2100. Our results show a paradigm shift in buildings' energy demand: appliances, lighting and space cooling dominate demand, while the weight of space heating and cooking declines. The importance of developing countries increases and electricity becomes the main energy carrier. Our results are of high relevance for climate mitigation studies as they create detailed baselines that define the mitigation challenge: the stress on the energy supply system stemming from buildings will grow, though mainly in the form of electricity for which a number of options to decrease GHG emissions exist.},

	abstract = {To mitigate emissions from the electricity and transportation sectors, large scale deployment of renewable energy generators and battery electric vehicles are expected in the coming decades. However, adoption of these technologies may exacerbate issues related to mismatch of electricity supply and demand. In this study, we utilize a hybrid capacity expansion and dispatch model to quantify grid impacts of the conversion of the entire road vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2050. We examine impacts of policies, such as targeting a renewable energy penetration of 93\%, using British Columbia as a case study. Scenarios making use of utility controlled charging of vehicles to balance supply and demand are further analyzed. Results show that although electrifying the entire road vehicle fleet will require generation capacity to increase by up to 60\%, relative to a scenario without electrification, levelized cost of electricity only increases by 9\% in the same scenario due to availability of low cost generation options such as wind and solar. We also find that a 93\% renewable energy target leads to carbon abatement costs 30\% lower than a scenario where this policy is removed. Further use of utility controlled charging reduces total system capacity up to 7\%.},

	abstract = {Building retrofit analysis in Switzerland traditionally relies on expert heuristics and best practices. These processes are not often supplemented by data or modeldriven techniques that would enhance the accuracy and ability to quantify the impact of innovative technologies. We present a process of calibrated building energy model (BEM) analysis of a case study using a building information model (BIM) and measured data from a custom wireless sensor network. The case study is a mixed-use office and residential historically listed building in Zürich, Switzerland. A BIM model was first developed in Autodesk Revit and then extracted to an EnergyPlus model through the Design Performance Viewer (DPV) toolkit. This toolkit uses the RevitPythonShell (RPS) plug-in to convert the BIM data model to a geometric representation for EnergyPlus. This model was further developed using the OpenStudio modeling suite and collected sensor data was used for calibration. The geometry translation process from BIM to BEM included many difficult challenges with respect to zone creation and model simplification. The calibration process was implemented on various façade and heating system retrofit options. A scenario was chosen for the project that has a predicted energy savings of 32\%. Other results of this calibration and lessons learned regarding model development and translation to EnergyPlus are discussed.},

	abstract = {Urban planners face significant challenges when identifying building energy efficiency opportunities and developing strategies to achieve efficient and sustainable urban environments. A possible scalable solution to tackle this problem is through the analysis of building stock databases. Such databases can support and assist with building energy benchmarking and potential retrofit performance analysis. However, developing a building stock database is a time-intensive modeling procedure that requires extensive data (both geometric and non-geometric). Furthermore, the available data for developing a building database is sparse, inconsistent, diverse and heterogeneous in nature. The main aim of this study is to develop a generic methodology to optimize urban scale energy retrofit decisions for residential buildings using data-driven approaches. Furthermore, data-driven approaches identify the key features influencing building energy performance. The proposed methodology formulates retrofit solutions and identifies optimal features for the residential building stock of Dublin. Results signify the importance of data-driven retrofit modeling as the feature selection process reduces the number of features in Dublin’s building stock database from 203 to 56 with a building rating prediction accuracy of 86\%. Amongst the 56 features, 16 are identified to be recommended as retrofit measures (such as fabric renovation values and heating system upgrade features) associated with each energy-efficiency rating. Urban planners and energy policymakers could use this methodology to optimize large-scale retrofit implementation, particularly at an urban scale with limited resources. Furthermore, stakeholders at the local authority level can estimate the required retrofit investment costs, emission reductions and energy savings using the target retrofit features of energy-efficiency ratings.},

The focus lies on determining the spatiotemporal variability of energy services in both standing and future buildings in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. This detailed characterization facilitates the assessment of potential energy efficiency measures at the neighborhood and city district scales. In a novel approach we integrated existing methods in urban and energy planning domains such as spatial analysis, dynamic building energy modeling and energy mapping to provide a comprehensive, multi-scale and multi-dimensional model of analysis. The model is part of a geographic information system (GIS), which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. The model is validated against measured data and a peer model for a city district in Switzerland. In this context, we present practical applications in the analysis of energy efficiency measures in buildings and urban zoning. We furthermore discuss potential applications in educational, urban and energy planning practices.},

In particular, the rate of adoption of new energy-efficient technologies is often hard to model and underlines the need for an advanced approach to capture diversity in decision-making, and enable the inclusion of economic, comfort, environmental and social aspects. This paper presents an enhanced agent-based model that captures several characteristics of consumer behaviour that influence investment decisions. Multiple agents with different objectives, search strategies, and decision methods are implemented. A case study is presented which illustrates the benefits of the approach for the residential sector in the UK. The agent-based method shows diversity in investment decisions, without requiring the constraints on uptake needed in many models. This leads to a range of technologies in the market during a transition phase, continuous investment in low capital cost technologies, and eventually the emergence of a low carbon system based on new mass market technologies. The system that emerges is vastly different from one observed when economically rational investment is assumed and uptake constraints are applied.},

	abstract = {Legal commitments to reduce CO2 emissions require policy makers to find cost-efficient means to meet these obligations. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves, which illustrate the economics associated with climate change mitigation, have recently attracted a great amount of attention. A number of limitations with MAC curves are explained by the implication they should be just one tool in a broader set of decision-making aids used in assessing climate policy. MAC curves, for example, omit ancillary benefits of greenhouse gas emission abatement, treat uncertainty in a limited manner, exclude intertemporal dynamics and lack the necessary transparency concerning their assumptions. MAC curves based on the individual assessment of abatement measures suffer from additional shortcomings such as the non-consideration of interactions and non-financial costs, a possibly inconsistent baseline, double counting and limited treatment of behavioural aspects. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation exhibit many of the above-mentioned problems, making it particularly difficult to capture in a cost curve. Policy makers should therefore be cautious when interpreting MAC curves, pay attention to the underlying assumptions, consider non-financial costs and be aware of the important uncertainties and underlying path dependencies.},

	abstract = {Urban building energy models aspire to become key planning tools for the holistic optimization of buildings, urban design, and energy systems in neighborhoods and districts. The energy demand of buildings is largely influenced by the behavior of the occupants. The insufficient consideration of occupant behavior is one of the causes to the “performance gap” in buildings - the difference between the simulated and the actually observed energy consumption. On the urban-scale impacts of different occupant behavior modeling approaches onto the various purposes of urban building energy models are still largely unknown. Research shows that the inappropriate choice of occupant behavior model could result in oversized district energy systems, leading to over-investment and low operational efficiency. This work therefore reviews urban building energy models in terms of their occupant behavior modeling approaches. Three categories of approaches are established and discussed: (1) deterministic space-based approaches, (2) stochastic space-based approaches, and (3) stochastic person-based approaches. They are further assessed in terms of their strategy to consider diversity in occupant behavior. Stochastic models, especially stochastic person-based models, seem to be superior to deterministic models. However, there are no stochastic models available yet that can be used for case studies of mixed-districts, comprising buildings of various occupancy types. In the reviewed urban-scale approaches, only single-use type districts (residential or office) are modeled with stochastic techniques. However, people interact with various buildings on a daily basis. Their activities relate to their presence in different spaces at the urban-scale and to their use of appliances in those spaces. Their individual levels of comfort and behavioral patterns govern the control actions towards building systems. Therefore, a novel activity-based multi-agent approach for urban occupant behavior modeling is proposed as alternative to current approaches.},

	abstract = {Designing infrastructure for a changing climate remains a major challenge for engineers. In popular discourse a narrative has emerged that infrastructures are likely underdesigned for the future. Weather-related hazards are directly embedded in the infrastructure design process. Yet the codes and standards that engineers use for this risk analysis have been changing for decades, sometimes increasing and other times decreasing design values. Further complicating the issue is that climate projections show increasing or decreasing intensities depending on the hazard and region. Thus, it is not clear that infrastructure is universally underdesigned. Here, analyses are developed at both regional and national scales using precipitation and roadway drainage systems to answer this question. First, it is shown that modeling uncertainty can pose challenges for using future projections to update region-specific standards. Second, the results show that depending on the historical design conditions and the direction of projections, roadway drainage infrastructures may be designed appropriately in some regions while in others they are possibly underdesigned. Given these uncertainties, the authors believe that there is a need for alternative design paradigms, and these needs are discussed.

	abstract = {Patterns of future climate and expected extreme conditions are pushing design limits as recognition of climate change and its implication for the built environment increases. There are a number of ways of estimating future climate projections and creating weather files. Obtaining adequate representation of long-term patterns of climate change and extreme conditions is, however, challenging. This work aims at answering two research questions: does a method of generating future weather files for building performance simulation bring advantages that cannot be provided by other methods? And what type of future weather files enable building engineers and designers to more credibly test robustness of their designs against climate change? To answer these two questions, the work provides an overview of the major approaches to create future weather data sets based on the statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate models. A number of weather data sets for Geneva were synthesized and applied to the energy simulation of 16 ASHRAE standard reference buildings, single buildings and their combination to create a virtual neighborhood. Representative weather files are synthesized to account for extreme conditions together with typical climate conditions and investigate their importance in the energy performance of buildings. According to the results, all the methods provide enough information to study the long-term impacts of climate change on average. However, the results also revealed that assessing the energy robustness of buildings only under typical future conditions is not sufficient. Depending on the type of building, the relative change of peak load for cooling demand under near future extreme conditions can still be up to 28.5\% higher compared to typical conditions. It is concluded that only those weather files generated based on dynamical downscaling and that take into consideration both typical and extreme conditions are the most reliable for providing representative boundary conditions to test the energy robustness of buildings under future climate uncertainties. The results for the neighborhood explaining the critical situation that an energy network may face due to increased peak load under extreme climatic conditions. Such critical situations remain unforeseeable by relying solely on typical and observed extreme conditions, putting the climate resilience of buildings and energy systems at risk.},

	abstract = {Climate plays an important role in heating energy consumption owing to the direct relationship between space heating and changes in meteorological conditions. To quantify the impact, the Transient System Simulation Program software was used to simulate the heating loads of office buildings in Harbin, Tianjin, and Shanghai, representing three major climate zones (i.e., severe cold, cold, and hot summer and cold winter climate zones) in China during 1961–2010. Stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to determine the key climatic parameters influencing heating energy consumption. The results showed that dry bulb temperature (DBT) is the dominant climatic parameter affecting building heating loads in all three climate zones across China during the heating period at daily, monthly, and yearly scales (R2 ≥ 0.86). With the continuous warming climate in winter over the past 50 years, heating loads decreased by 14.2, 7.2, and 7.1 W/m2 in Harbin, Tianjin, and Shanghai, respectively, indicating that the decreasing rate is more apparent in severe cold climate zone. When the DBT increases by 1 °C, the heating loads decrease by 253.1 W/m2 in Harbin, 177.2 W/m2 in Tianjin, and 126.4 W/m2 in Shanghai. These results suggest that the heating energy consumption can be well predicted by the regression models at different temporal scales in different climate conditions owing to the high determination coefficients. In addition, a greater decrease in heating energy consumption in northern severe cold and cold climate zones may efficiently promote the energy saving in these areas with high energy consumption for heating. Particularly, the likely future increase in temperatures should be considered in improving building energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Weather has significant impacts on the thermal environment and energy use in buildings. Thus, accurate weather data are crucial for building performance evaluations. Traditionally, typical year data inputs are used to represent long-term weather data. However, there is no guarantee that a single year represents the changing climate well. In this study, the long-term representation of a typical year was assessed by comparing it to a 55-year actual weather data set. To investigate the weather impact on building energy use, 559 simulation runs of a prototype office building were performed for 10 large cities covering all climate zones in China. The analysis results demonstrated that the weather data varied significantly from year to year. Hence, a typical year cannot reflect the variation range of weather fluctuations. Typical year simulations overestimated or underestimated the energy use and peak load in many cases. With the increase in computational power of personal computers, it is feasible and essential to adopt multiyear simulations for full assessments of long-term building performance, as this will improve decision-making by allowing for the full consideration of variations in building energy use.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a multi-year (MY) approach to building energy simulation and presents a pilot study in Hong Kong that investigates long-term building energy performance using MY weather data. Building energy simulations in the pilot study were carried out using the DOE-2.1E program. A set of 17 years hourly weather data (1979-95) was taken as the weather input to drive the simulation. It is found that the MY approach can provide more information for the analysis of long-term building energy performance and climatic properties. It can also remove the ambiguity of typical years and design weather in the present-day simulation approach. Although the MY approach has many advantages, its implementation does require great efforts since a lot more data and computations are involved. The availability of MY weather data is a critical limiting factor at present. To carry out MY simulation effectively, it is important to develop an efficient simulation process and new ways of interpreting simulation results. It is hoped that more thoughts can be stimulated to develop this approach for improving the accuracy and capability of building energy simulation.},

	abstract = {Buildings consume more than one third of the world’s total primary energy. Weather plays a unique and significant role as it directly affects the thermal loads and thus energy performance of buildings. The traditional simulated energy performance using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather data represents the building performance for a typical year, but not necessarily the average or typical long-term performance as buildings with different energy systems and designs respond differently to weather changes. Furthermore, the single-year TMY simulations do not provide a range of results that capture yearly variations due to changing weather, which is important for building energy management, and for performing risk assessments of energy efficiency investments. This paper employs large-scale building simulation (a total of 3162 runs) to study the weather impact on peak electricity demand and energy use with the 30-year (1980–2009) Actual Meteorological Year (AMY) weather data for three types of office buildings at two design efficiency levels, across all 17 ASHRAE climate zones. The simulated results using the AMY data are compared to those from the TMY3 data to determine and analyze the differences. Besides further demonstration, as done by other studies, that actual weather has a significant impact on both the peak electricity demand and energy use of buildings, the main findings from the current study include: (1) annual weather variation has a greater impact on the peak electricity demand than it does on energy use in buildings; (2) the simulated energy use using the TMY3 weather data is not necessarily representative of the average energy use over a long period, and the TMY3 results can be significantly higher or lower than those from the AMY data; (3) the weather impact is greater for buildings in colder climates than warmer climates; (4) the weather impact on the medium-sized office building was the greatest, followed by the large office and then the small office; and (5) simulated energy savings and peak demand reduction by energy conservation measures using the TMY3 weather data can be significantly underestimated or overestimated. It is crucial to run multi-decade simulations with AMY weather data to fully assess the impact of weather on the long-term performance of buildings, and to evaluate the energy savings potential of energy conservation measures for new and existing buildings from a life cycle perspective.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study is to determine whether the use of Typical Year (TY) type weather file is adequate for estimating heating and cooling load in Building Energy Simulation (BES). Two Typical Year (TY) Type weather files – Canadian Weather Year for Energy Calculation(CWEC) 1990s and CWEC 2016 are compared with Historical Year (HY) weather data Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Datasets(CWEEDs) 1998 to 2014. Three stages of analysis are completed – 1) comparison of the cumulative distribution of Dry Bulb Temperature and Global Horizontal Irradiance; 2) analysis of extreme weather event occurrences through comparing temperature-based weather indices; 3) comparison of BES results from simulating DOE prototype buildings. Results show a hotter summer and warmer winter in CWEC 2016 indicated by a shift of median temperature in stage 1, increased hot weather characterizing indices and decreased cold weather characterizing indices in stage 2 when compared with CWEC 1990s. This translates to a lower heating energy use and higher cooling energy use in stage 3 with simulation using CWEC 2016. The total 17-year heating and cooling energy sum estimation using CWEC 2016 shows lower percentage difference for all buildings, ranging from 0 to -8\% difference, where most buildings are -1\% or -2\% from the estimation using historical weather data. However, neither simulation using CWEC 1990s nor CWEC 2016 yield consistent accuracy when compared to the yearly Historical simulation results, since the occurrence of years with hotter/colder temperature shows a periodical cycle, some years have more hot weather events, whereas other years have more cold weather event. This study concludes that Typical Year simulation alone is not sufficient for Building Energy Simulation because 1) past weather data might not be a good indication of recent or future weather events due to changes in climate; 2) the update cycle of TY type weather files are infrequent and therefore most recent climate may not be included in the analysis. Future work should focus on the development of a commonly accepted practice in using multi-year simulation, as well as a commonly accepted format for future or stochastic weather file format.},

	abstract = {A consensus is forming among experts that the best way to achieve emissions’ reduction in the near and mid-term is increasing the demand-side energy efficiency—this is especially true in developing countries where the potential for demand reduction is significant and achievable at relatively lower cost. Enhanced energy efficiency also reduces energy costs and can result in a financial benefit to end-users, if the life-cycle value of energy savings offsets the upfront cost of implementing the measure. At the same time, reducing energy demand translates into lower pull for fossil fuel import and supply/distribution capacity expansion. An ideal candidate for the implementation of demand-side energy efficiency measures is the building sector, since it contributes to a large extent to the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted worldwide. In most developing countries, the contribution of the building sector to the total national GHG emissions is significantly higher than the worldwide average. This is in part due to the lower level of industrial activity. Other drivers of the high emissions of the building sector are the inefficiency of the envelope and technical systems of the existing buildings, as well as harsh climatic conditions requiring the use of energy intensive air-conditioning equipment. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) currently have the highest ecological footprint per capita in the world. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the focus of this study, can be expected to have a footprint that is even higher, being the largest economy and the major oil producer among the seven Emirates. In addition to the environmental consequences of unrestrained energy consumption, the fact that energy prices are heavily subsidized in  Abu Dhabi results in a significant financial burden for the government. In the UAE and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the air-conditioning load in buildings is the ideal target for  demand-side management because it constitutes more than 60\% of the total energy consumption. However, many sources of uncertainty still remain. How should we assess the life-cycle cost/benefit of candidate demand-side interventions? Which ones to choose in order to maximize national utility? This study will start to answer those questions by using a detailed engineering model of a typical Abu Dhabi building as specified by the Emirate’s Urban Planning Council. Using the model building as a baseline, we then proceed to evaluate the energy impact of different retrofits through numerical simulation. We present a novel Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) for the Emirate of  Abu Dhabi focusing exclusively on demand-side measures having an impact on the  air-conditioning load. A surprising number of the abatement levers analyzed in this study exhibit a positive net present value (NPV), if the cost-reflective price of electricity is used for the life-cycle assessment.},

The economics of climate action needs to be at the forefront of climate dialogue to prioritize investments among competing mitigation measures. A marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve is an effective visualization of climate action that initiates a technical and economic discussion of the cost-effectiveness and abatement potential of such actions among local leaders, policy makers, and climate experts. More commonly demonstrated for countries, MAC curves need to be developed for cities because of their heterogeneity, which vary in their urban activities, energy supply, infrastructure stock, and commuting patterns. The methodology for constructing bottom-up MAC curves for cities is presented for technologies that offer fuel switching and/or energy efficiencies, while considering technology lifetimes, city-specific electricity and fuel prices, and emission intensities. Resulting MAC curves are unique to every city, and chart the pathway towards low-carbon growth by prioritizing measures based on cost-effectiveness. A case study of Toronto’s climate targets demonstrates the prioritization of select technologies. Leveraging MAC curves to support climate programs enables cities to strategically invest in financing climate action and designing incentives.},

	abstract = {The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) has an especial feature for existing buildings, a Recommendation List of Measures (RLM) designed to improve the energy performance of these buildings. This feature has not been properly studied by researchers or policymakers, in spite of being one of the main tools that can encourage building owners to perform renovation activities. Considering the scarce research focusing on the recommendations list of measures, more information is needed in order to identify weaknesses, barriers and improvements of this tool. This is especially important since the European commitment to reduce their emissions in 2020 are far from reaching the proposed goals, mainly becouse of the low renovation rate. This critical review is based on the current literature mainly from reports delivered by the Commission and academic research. The study focuses on the requirement set by the directive, its current performance, barriers and improvements that can be made to take this tool to a level that can be effectively used by policymakers, certifiers and owners. The upgrade of the recommendation list of measure should strengthen their calculation methods and procedure from both local authorities and the Commission. This should be in line with the certifiers’ needs in order to do relevant work, including proper training, mandatory field inspections and tools. Lastly, financial policies and information should be implemented to accompany the certificate, ensuring that building owners interested in renovation have assistance and financial facilities or easy access to relevant information on this matter. The main conclusion of this study reveals that the regulatory framework could use some strictness in order to avoid ‘just enough’ implementations. Ambiguous definitions and too flexible obligations should be revised, especially cost-effectiveness and training for the certifiers. Attention on how to deliver the information to building owners should be increased, allowing them to understand the results, its implications and how to concretize renovation work through financial mechanisms, thus increasing the reliability of the EPC and the RLM.},

	abstract = {The building sector accounts for 40\% of the total energy consumption in the EU. It faces great challenges to meet the goal of transforming the existing building stocks into near zero-energy buildings by 2050. The development of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) schemes in the EU provides a powerful and comprehensive information tool to quantitatively predict annual energy demand from the building stock, creating a demand-driven market for energy-effective buildings. Properties with improved energy rating have had a positive impact on property investments and rental return because of the reduced energy bills. In addition, the EPC databases have been applied to energy planning and building renovations. However, it should be mentioned that the current evaluation system faces problems, such as not being fully implemented, delivering low quality and insufficient information to stimulate renovation, therefore requiring improvements to be made. This paper provides a review of the current EPC situations in the EU and discusses the direction of future improvements. The next generation EPC should rely on BIM technology, benefit from big data techniques and use building smart-readiness indicators to create a more reliable, affordable, comprehensive and customer-tailored instrument, which could better represent energy efficiency, together with occupants’ perceived comfort, and air quality. Improved EPC schemes are expected to play an active role in monitoring building performance, future energy planning and quantifying building renovation rates, promoting energy conservation and sustainability.},

	abstract = {This paper explores why domestic energy policies, thermal retrofitting and the operation of domestic energy-efficient technologies are often met with social inertia in practice. Two sets of interview data – UK homeowners who have retrofitted their property and social housing tenants living in energy-efficient housing – reveal a very different mix of habits, skills and attitudes regarding domestic heating, rooted in socio-economic background and further determined by tenure. Middle-class homeowners’ retrofit design were part of their social and economic capital and self-expression of taste. These aspirational retrofits were characterized by comfort, conspicuous consumption and do-it-yourself (DIY) activities. Policy should strengthen these ‘paths of least resistance’ by providing resources to harness the taste-motivated retrofit stream. In contrast, the less-privileged tenant group struggled with the basic interaction with new technologies imposed on them and need more tailor-made paths: simpler heating controls; a simpler manual for some; and practical measures such as burglar-proof natural ventilation. The paper explores how social stratification and status-led consumption can be brought into understandings of energy retrofitting practices. Reflecting on gender in such contexts could also help to overcome exclusion practices and stereotyping, and there are market opportunities for retrofit packages to engage women and harness their emerging interest in DIY.},

However, the long-term contribution of wind to future energy supply, and the degree to which policy support is necessary to motivate higher levels of deployment, depends—in part—on the future costs of both onshore and offshore wind. Here, we summarize the results of an expert elicitation survey of 163 of the world’s foremost wind experts, aimed at better understanding future costs and technology advancement possibilities. Results suggest significant opportunities for cost reductions, but also underlying uncertainties. Under the median scenario, experts anticipate 24–30\% reductions by 2030 and 35–41\% reductions by 2050 across the three wind applications studied. Costs could be even lower: experts predict a 10\% chance that reductions will be more than 40\% by 2030 and more than 50\% by 2050. Insights gained through expert elicitation complement other tools for evaluating cost-reduction potential, and help inform policy and planning, R\&D and industry strategy.},

III/III+) designs to be somewhat more expensive in 2030 than they were in 2010, and they expected the next generation of designs (Gen. IV) to be more expensive still as of 2030. Projected costs of proposed small modular reactors (SMRs) were similar to those of Gen. IV systems. The experts almost unanimously recommended large increases in government support for nuclear RD\&D (generally 2−3 times current spending). The majority expected that such RD\&D would have only a modest eﬀect on cost, but would improve performance in other areas, such as safety, waste management, and uranium resource utilization. The U.S. and E.U. experts were in relative agreement regarding how government RD\&D funds should be allocated, placing particular focus on very high temperature reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors, fuels and materials, and fuel cycle technologies.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges managers face when trying to understand complex, technological systems (in their eﬀorts to mitigate system risks) is the quantiﬁcation of accident probability, particularly in the case of rare events. Once this risk information has been quantiﬁed, managers and decision makers can use it to develop appropriate policies, design projects, and/or allocate resources that will mitigate risk. However, rare event risk information inherently suﬀers from a sparseness of accident data. Therefore, expert judgment is often elicited to develop frequency data for these high-consequence rare events. When applied appropriately, expert judgment can serve as an important (and, at times, the only) source of risk information. This paper presents a Bayesian methodology for assessing relative accident probabilities and their uncertainty using paired comparison to elicit expert judgments. The approach is illustrated using expert judgment data elicited for a risk study of the largest passenger ferry system in the US.},

In this paper, we standardize disparate expert elicitation data from five EU and US studies, involving 65 experts, of the future costs of photovoltaics (PV) and evaluate the impact of expert and study characteristics on the elicited metrics. The results for PV suggest that in-person elicitations are associated with more optimistic 2030 PV cost estimates and in some models with a larger range of uncertainty than online elicitations. Unlike in previous results on nuclear power, expert affiliation type and nationality do not affect central estimates. Some specifications suggest that EU experts are more optimistic about breakthroughs, but they are also less confident in that they provide larger ranges of estimates than do US experts. Higher R\&D investment is associated with lower future costs. Rather than increasing confidence, high R\&D increases uncertainty about future costs, mainly because it improves the base case (low cost) outcomes more than it improves the worst case (high cost) outcomes.},

A better understanding of the key determinants of energy efficient retrofit investments in the residential sector is therefore crucial for the design of effective policies aimed at reducing energy demand and CO2 emissions. This article uses combined data from “English Housing” surveys and employs a probit model in order to investigate the dwelling-related and households characteristics influencing energy efficient retrofit investments in the English residential sector. The results show that couples with independent child(ren) living in detached or semi-detached houses built before 1990 and with a length of residence higher than 1 year are more likely to invest in retrofits measures; compared to households living in the North East region, households living in London are less likely to invest. While there is empirical evidence supporting the landlord-tenant problem, households that have taken out a mortgage are more likely to invest in energy efficient retrofit measures than outright owners. To maximise their impact and effectiveness, future energy efficiency policies should target specific household groups with the lowest rate of retrofit uptake.},

Two cases (building retrofitting and electric heating) were analysed using the same city, Stockholm (Sweden), and the same input data, energy performance certificates and heat energy use metering data. The distinctive character of these problems resulted in different modelling workflows and archetypes being developed. The building retrofitting case followed a hybrid approach, integrating statistical and physical perspectives, estimating energy savings for 5532 buildings from seven retrofitting packages. The electric heating case provided an explicitly statistical data-driven view of the problem, estimating potential for improvement of power capacity of the local electric grid at peak electric power of 147 MW. The conclusion was that the growing availability of linked building energy data requires a shift in the urban building energy modelling (UBEM) paradigm from single-logic models to on-request multiple-purpose data intelligence services.},

	abstract = {Private households constitute approximately 30\% of the total energy consumption in Denmark. The greatest potential for reducing energy consumption in private households is through retrofits of existing houses. One of the most common ways to promote retrofits is the act of sending an energy advisor to visit homeowners in order to explain the technological and economic advantages that arise from undertaking a retrofit. However, little is known about how homeowners make sense of retrofits. Based on an extensive anthropological fieldwork study of 12 Danish homeowners who had received energy advice, retrofits were investigated from the perspective of the everyday life of homeowners. Three social dimensions that played an important role when the people in the study discussed house renovation were identified and discussed: houses as part of homeowners’ life cycles and personal events; houses as frameworks for social relations; and houses as markers of social values and status. These results indicate a need to develop new strategies to promote retrofits more effectively, which focus less on the techno-economic aspects and more on the social dimensions.},

This paper explores when it is sensible to perform such elicitation and how that can best be done. A number of key issues are discussed, including topics on which there are, and are not, experts who have knowledge that provides a basis for making informed predictive judgments; the inadequacy of only using qualitative uncertainty language; the role of cognitive heuristics and of overconfidence; the choice of experts; the development, refinement, and iterative testing of elicitation protocols that are designed to help experts to consider systematically all relevant knowledge when they make their judgments; the treatment of uncertainty about model functional form; diversity of expert opinion; and when it does or does not make sense to combine judgments from different experts. Although it may be tempting to view expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.},

	abstract = {Retrofitting of existing buildings offers significant opportunities for reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This is being considered as one of main approaches to achieving sustainability in the built environment at relatively low cost and high uptake rates. Although there are a wide range of retrofit technologies readily available, methods to identify the most cost-effective retrofit measures for particular projects is still a major technical challenge. This paper provides a systematic approach to proper selection and identification of the best retrofit options for existing buildings. The generic building retrofit problem and key issues that are involved in building retrofit investment decisions are presented. Major retrofit activities are also briefly discussed, such as energy auditing, building performance assessment, quantification of energy benefits, economic analysis, risk assessment, and measurement and verification (M\&V) of energy savings, all of which are essential to the success of a building retrofit project. An overview of the research and development as well as application of the retrofit technologies in existing buildings is also provided. The aim of this work is to provide building researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of how to effectively conduct a building retrofit to promote energy conservation and sustainability.},

	abstract = {Knowledge regarding the characteristics of national building stocks is fundamental to understanding how the energy performance of the building stock can be improved. To facilitate large diversity and a number of buildings for such analyses, this paper presents a methodology by which national building stocks may be aggregated through archetype buildings. The methodology has been implemented and verified in four EU countries in regions with different climates, namely France, Germany, Spain and the UK. These countries account for about half of the final energy consumption of the EU-28 buildings. The analysis includes the residential and non-residential sectors (residential sector only for Germany). The number of archetypes per country has been defined according to different categories of building type, construction year, climate region and the main fuel source for heating purposes. The accuracy of the description is validated by simulating energy demand using the ECCABS Building Stock Model, and comparing the final energy demand modeled with corresponding statistical data. The total final energy demand calculated for these countries differs from available statistics by between −6\% and +2\%, which is considered satisfactory. The proposed description of the building stock is being used as a basis for analyzing the potential for and cost of energy conservation measures.},

	abstract = {One of our greatest challenges as researchers is predicting impacts of land use on biota, and predicting the impact of livestock grazing on birds is no exception. Insufficient data and poor survey design often yield results that are not statistically significant or that are difficult to interpret because researchers cannot disentangle the effects of grazing from other disturbances. This has resulted in few publications on the impact of grazing on birds alone. Ecologists with extensive experience in bird ecology in grazed landscapes could inform an analysis when time and monetary constraints limit the amount of data that can be collected. Using responses from 20 well-recognized ecologists throughout Australia, we captured this expert knowledge and incorporated it into a statistical model using Bayesian methods. Although relatively new to ecology, Bayesian methods allow straightforward probability statements to be made about specific models or scenarios and the integration of different types of information, including scientific judgment, while formally accommodating and incorporating the uncertainty in the information provided. Data on bird density were collected across three broad levels of grazing (no/low, moderate, and high) typical of subtropical Australia. These field data were used in conjunction with expert data to produce estimates of species persistence under grazing. The addition of expert data through priors in our model strengthened results under at least one grazing level for all but one bird species examined. When experts were in agreement credible intervals were tightened substantially, whereas, when experts were in disagreement, results were similar to those evaluated in the absence of expert information. In fields where there is extensive expert knowledge, yet little published data, the use of expert information as priors for ecological models is a cost-effective way of making more confident predictions about the effect of management on biodiversity.},

Curiously, although this work was debated at the time and more recent work has largely refuted many of the claims, this apparent heuristics and biases bias in elicitation research has gone unremarked.

We identified six types of explanatory variables considered in the studies: demographic/housing characteristics/location of residence (I), decision-maker dispositions (II), beliefs about consequences for (III) and beyond (IV) the household, social influences (V) and policy measures (VI). Energy-relevant investment decisions were often associated with beliefs about consequences for and beyond the household and with receiving energy consulting and financial incentives, although the effectiveness of financial measures appears to depend on how they are implemented.

Compared to partial retrofit measures, an integral approach to retrofits is more strongly associated with estimated energy saving potential, household income and professional advice seeking. On the other hand, free public energy consultation appears to have failed to deliver the expected outcome.

	abstract = {Current energy efficiency policy and incentive programs tend to target economic motivations, which may misalign with other potentially important motivations arising from situational factors, individual differences, and social context. Thus, in this research, we review areas of work that have focused on psychological and social influences to energy efficiency adoption in commercial buildings. We then conduct an empirical scoping study interviewing 10 commercial building owners/managers (decision makers) and 10 experts/consultants (decision influencers) regarding perceived motives and barriers to energy efficient investments, decision-maker attributes, and the social context of the decision. Potential factors that emerge from the interviews, which are not yet extensively discussed in the energy efficiency literature, include owners/managers’ resistance to change and the influence of investment funding origins on the decision. Our results also suggest potential heterogeneity in energy efficiency decision-making philosophies between the two groups. Interviewed owners/managers prioritize corporate social responsibility (CSR) and prefer internal consulting (e.g., building engineers). Conversely, experts/consultants do not emphasize CSR and are more concerned with external policies. These findings suggest that accounting for the decision maker and the social context in which decisions are made could enhance the design of commercial sector energy efficiency programs.},

	abstract = {Renovation/retrofit is a key policy measure to reduce energy and emissions in existing residential stock. Existing approaches are typically based on assumptions about individual attitudes and technical–rational models, reliant on regulations and incentive programmes to influence homeowner ‘behaviour’. However, insufficient evaluation, together with inadequate attention given to the social dimensions of renovation, result in considerable uncertainty over the effectiveness of such policies. Drawing on ethnographic case studies informed by theories of social practice, this paper examines to what extent low energy and other environmental concerns come into play in renovations when they are conceptualized as social practices. A practice theory approach is adopted to analyze the intersection of renovations with homeowners’ practices. The analysis highlights the disparity between policy intentions for energy efficiency and everyday life. Findings reveal retrofit practices are mediated by the performance of practices comprising daily routines, both current and those anticipated in the future. Current policies and programmes focused on technical interventions to improve energy efficiency will have limited reach and impact. Instead, it is suggested, among other interventions, that policies to reduce the environmental impact of housing should be reframed around and positioned to address the mundane practices of everyday life.},

	abstract = {Elicitation is a key task for subjectivist Bayesians. Although skeptics hold that elicitation cannot (or perhaps should not) be done, in practice it brings statisticians closer to their clients and subject-matter expert colleagues. This article reviews the state of the art, reflecting the experience of statisticians informed by the fruits of a long line of psychological research into how people represent uncertain information cognitively and how they respond to questions about that information. In a discussion of the elicitation process, the first issue to address is what it means for an elicitation to be successful; that is, what criteria should be used. Our answer is that a successful elicitation faithfully represents the opinion of the person being elicited. It is not necessarily “true” in some objectivistic sense, and cannot be judged in that way. We see that elicitation as simply part of the process of statistical modeling. Indeed, in a hierarchical model at which point the likelihood ends and the prior begins is ambiguous. Thus the same kinds of judgment that inform statistical modeling in general also inform elicitation of prior distributions. The psychological literature suggests that people are prone to certain heuristics and biases in how they respond to situations involving uncertainty. As a result, some of the ways of asking questions about uncertain quantities are preferable to others, and appear to be more reliable. However, data are lacking on exactly how well the various methods work, because it is unclear, other than by asking using an elicitation method, just what the person believes. Consequently, one is reduced to indirect means of assessing elicitation methods. The tool chest of methods is growing. Historically, the first methods involved choosing hyperparameters using conjugate prior families, at a time when these were the only families for which posterior distributions could be computed. Modern computational methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, have freed elicitation from this constraint. As a result, now both parametric and nonparametric methods are available for low-dimensional problems. High-dimensional problems are probably best thought of as lacking another hierarchical level, which has the effect of reducing the as-yet-unelicited parameter space. Special considerations apply to the elicitation of group opinions. Informal methods, such as Delphi, encourage the participants to discuss the issue in the hope of reaching consensus. Formal methods, such as weighted averages or logarithmic opinion pools, each have mathematical characteristics that are uncomfortable. Finally, there is the question of what a group opinion even means, because it is not necessarily the opinion of any participant.},

	abstract = {Buildings are significant drivers of climate change, generating one third of global greenhouse gas emissions. When new buildings are constructed to high performance standards, increased rates of building replacement spurred by rising property values can raise the operating efficiency of building stocks. However, it can take years before the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with new construction are offset by more efficient operations. This paper calculates the carbon dioxide emission payback period of newly constructed efficient single family homes in Vancouver, British Columbia. The average carbon dioxide emission payback period of 168 years for a typical high efficiency new home renders it unlikely that emission savings will be realized before it is replaced. A statistical model called the Teardown Index is presented, which indicates that replacing older poorly performing homes with new high efficiency homes in Vancouver will result in 1.3–2.8 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 2017 and 2050. For each percent increase to the compound annual growth rate of property values, an additional 150 thousand tonnes of CO2e will be released between 2017-2050. The findings suggest that current policies aimed at reducing emissions through new high efficiency buildings should be reconsidered.},

In this study, we analyze the EGH data compiled between October 1998 and September 2005 to determine what types of households chose to participate and what appear to be the main factors underlying retrofit decisions. In the program, homeowners were prescribed specific upgrade types in the first audit. Hence, the decision problem involves whether to retrofit at all and how many of the prescribed upgrades to adopt. Moreover, the second audit that reveals this decision does not reflect the possibility that some homeowners might have undertaken the recommended upgrades but opted not to or have yet to undergo the second audit. We adopt an econometric technique that takes these features of the data into account. We find that energy cost savings, financial incentives, and costs of retrofits are important factors behind retrofit decisions given several other home- and household-specific characteristics.},

This is consistent with Hassett and Metcalf (1993) and Metcalf and Rosenthal (1995), and with the fact that our scenarios contain no uncertainty. Respondents who feel completely uncertain about future energy prices are more likely to select the status quo (no renovations) in any given choice task and weight the costs of the investments more heavily than the financial gains (subsidies and savings on the energy bills).

In the survey, respondents were asked directly for reasons for and against retrofitting their homes, but also faced a choice experiment involving different energy retrofit measures. Overall, we find that house owners who are able to afford it financially, for whom it is profitable, and for whom there is a favorable opportunity are more likely to undertake energy retrofit activities. The latter point seems to be of particular importance in explaining the persistent low retrofit rate in Germany.

The house, designed and built as a solar house with very low energy use during operation, is located in southern Norway. It features both passive and active solar measures. In the study, the built version is compared with four other versions: two versions where the house is designed according to the requirements of the new Norwegian Building Code, one version where the house is designed according to present standards in Norway, and one version where the house is designed according to the principles used by the architects presently building “green” buildings in Norway. The results, which are also compared with some results from German studies, show that solar buildings have a lower overall energy use, when both embodied energy and energy use during operation are taken into account. The results also show that there should be little difference between the approaches of the two schools of thought. The best buildings will generally be those that are both solar, low energy, and “green”.},

The cases included both residential and non-residential units. Despite climate and other background differences, the study revealed a linear relation between operating and total energy valid through all the cases. Case studies on buildings built according to different design criteria, and at parity of all other conditions, showed that design of low-energy buildings induces both a net benefit in total life cycle energy demand and an increase in the embodied energy. A solar house proved to be more energy efficient than an equivalent house built with commitment to use “green” materials. Also, the same solar house decreased life cycle energy demand by a factor of two with respect to an equivalent conventional version, when operating energy was expressed as end-use energy and the lifetime assumed to be 50 years. A passive house proved to be more energy efficient than an equivalent self-sufficient solar house. Also, the same passive house decreased life cycle energy demand by a factor of three – expected to rise to four in a new version – with respect to an equivalent conventional version, when operating energy was expressed as primary energy and the lifetime assumed to be 80 years.},

On the other hand the concept of ‘net energy’ as used in the field of ecological economics, which does take into account the energy used during the production process of a commodity, is widely applied in fields such as renewable energy assessment. In this paper the concept of ‘net energy’ is introduced and applied within the built environment, based on a methodology accounting for the embodied energy of building components together with energy use in operation.

	abstract = {Buildings demand energy in their life cycle right from its construction to demolition. Studies on the total energy use during the life cycle are desirable to identify phases of largest energy use and to develop strategies for its reduction. In the present paper, a critical review of the life cycle energy analyses of buildings resulting from 73 cases across 13 countries is presented. The study includes both residential and office buildings. Results show that operating (80–90\%) and embodied (10–20\%) phases of energy use are significant contributors to building's life cycle energy demand. Life cycle energy (primary) requirement of conventional residential buildings falls in the range of 150–400kWh/m2 per year and that of office buildings in the range of 250–550kWh/m2 per year. Building's life cycle energy demand can be reduced by reducing its operating energy significantly through use of passive and active technologies even if it leads to a slight increase in embodied energy. However, an excessive use of passive and active features in a building may be counterproductive. It is observed that low energy buildings perform better than self-sufficient (zero operating energy) buildings in the life cycle context. Since, most of the case studies available in open literature pertain to developed and/or cold countries; hence, energy indicative figures for developing and/or non-cold countries need to be evaluated and compared with the results presented in this paper.},

The three streams are Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) and Life Cycle Carbon Emissions Assessment (LCCO2A). They were compared against their evaluation objectives, methodologies, and findings. Although they share similar objectives in evaluating the environmental impacts over the life cycle of building construction, they show some differences in the major focuses of evaluation and methodologies employed. Generally, it has been revealed that quite consistent results can be derived from the three streams with regard to the relative contribution of different phases of life cycle. However, discrepancies occur among the findings obtained from the three streams when different compositions of fuel mixes are used in power generation, or when the overall impacts are not contributed mostly by greenhouse gases emissions. The use of different functional units in different studies also makes it difficult to compare results with benchmarks or results from previous studies. Besides, there are drawbacks in boundary scoping, methodology framework, data inventory and practices which impair their usefulness as a decision making support tool for sustainable building designs.},

Total life cycle energy use in a building consists of two components: embodied and operational energy. Embodied energy is expended in the processes of building material production, on-site delivery, construction, maintenance, renovation and final demolition. Operational energy is consumed in operating the buildings. Studies have revealed the growing significance of embodied energy inherent in buildings and have demonstrated its relationship to carbon emissions. Current interpretations of embodied energy are quite unclear and vary greatly, and embodied energy databases suffer from the problems of variation and incomparability. Parameters differ and cause significant variation in reported embodied energy figures. Studies either followed the international Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standards or did not mention compliance with any standard. Literature states that the current LCA standards fail to provide complete guidance and do not address some important issues. It also recommends developing a set of standards to streamline the embodied energy calculation process. This paper discusses parameters causing problems in embodied energy data and identifies unresolved issues in current LCA standards. We also recommend an approach to derive guidelines that could be developed into a globally accepted protocol.},

	abstract = {This literature review addresses the Life Cycle Energy Analysis (LCEA) of residential buildings. As the fluctuation in the choice of functional units, boundaries of the system, life cycle inventory (LCI) methods, metrics and impact indicators complicated the potential comparability, the guidelines of Product Category Rule (PCR) 2014:02 for buildings were applied for the normalization procedure. Even though PCR provided a clear statement of the boundaries and a complete presentation of the results, uncertainty deriving from the LCI methods and the omissions in the system boundaries indicates that further standardization is needed. The sample consisted of 90 LCEA case studies of conventional, passive, low energy and nearly zero energy residential buildings (nZEB). Additional analysis identified an underestimation between case studies that use process instead of hybrid analysis, as the average value of embodied energy in hybrid analysis appears to be 3.92 times higher than in process analysis case studies. The highest value of embodied energy for an nZEB case study quantified with process analysis appears to be lower than all the input-output hybrid case studies. A revised definition, according to current trends and requirements in energy efficiency regulations, was also provided as an update of their consistency in time. Operating energy appeared to dominate in life cycle energy of residential buildings in the past. The results of this review show an increasing share of embodied energy in the transaction from conventional to passive, low energy and nZEB, despite the reduction in the total life cycle energy that could reach up to 50\%. The share of embodied energy dominates, mainly in low energy and nearly zero energy buildings, with a share of 26\%–57\% and 74\%–100\% respectively. In passive buildings, the share of embodied energy varies within a range between 11\% and 33\% that reaches the embodied energy limits of both a conventional and a low energy building. The use of renewable energy sources (RES) in a passive house, for the production of electricity, classifies it in the range of embodied energy of an nZEB. A significant gap of 17\% in the share of embodied energy, between the nearly zero and the most energy efficient building examined in the current review, is identified. This difference appears to be more important for the conventional and passive buildings, indicating the relative significance of embodied energy through time and towards the nZEB. Furthermore, if uncertainty and the underestimation of embodied energy deriving by process analysis were considered this gap could be different. The increase of embodied energy in buildings, indicates that a whole life cycle energy analysis may be needed in the methodological framework of current energy efficiency regulations.},

As the building was claimed to be sustainable on the basis of its outstanding energy saving performances, an ex post LCA was set up to understand whether, and to what extent, the positive judgement could be confirmed in a life cycle perspective. The dramatic contribution of materials-related impacts emerged. The shell-embedded materials represented the highest relative contribution, but maintenance operations also played a major role. The contributions of plants, building process and transportation were minor. The important role of the recycling potential also emerged. Unlike standard buildings, where heating-related impacts overshadow the rest of the life cycle, there is no single dominating item or aspect. Rather, several of them play equally important roles. The study has confirmed that the initial goal of environmental sustainability was reached, but to a much lower extent than previously thought. In comparison to a standard house, while the winter heat requirement was reduced by a ratio of 10:1, the life cycle energy was only reduced by 2.1:1 and the carbon footprint by 2.2:1.},

	abstract = {The design of high-performance buildings has been questioned for their actual performance in operation, where the impact of external perturbations such as occupant behavior and climate has proved to be prominent. These sources of variability, called aleatory uncertainties, are inherent variations of nondeterministic systems and are irreducible. Therefore, one of the main approaches to deal with these uncertainties is to consider them as noise during the design phase. The goal of the design is hence achieving a solution whose performance is least sensitive to the noise. This specific design process is called robust design. In this study, a prospect of climate conditions that a building might face during its lifespan is identified. However, although robust design can support the design of building variants whose performance is insensitive to typical climate conditions and also predictable extreme climate conditions, these building variants cannot be considered protected in case of unforeseeable extreme events. During such events, another property called resilience is required, which focuses on withstanding and recovering during and after the occurrence of the event. This study reviews the concepts of robustness and resilience and organizes them into a framework that clarifies their relationships in the protection of buildings against climate uncertainties.},

In particular, we explore how the stabilization-based discourse has become dominant through developments in climate science, environmental economics and policymaking. That this discourse is tethered to contemporary policy proposals is unsurprising; but that it has remained relatively free of critical scrutiny can be associated with fears of unsettling often-tenuous political processes taking place at multiple scales. Nonetheless, we posit that the fundamental premises behind stabilization targets are badly matched to the actual problem of the intergenerational management of climate change, scientifically and politically, and destined to fail. By extension, we argue that policy proposals for climate stabilization are problematic, infeasible, and hence impede more productive policy action on climate change. There are gains associated with an expansion and reconsideration of the range of possible policy framings of the problem, which are likely to help us to more capably and dynamically achieve goals of decarbonizing and modernizing the energy system, as well as diminishing anthropogenic contributions to climate change.},

	abstract = {Climate change and increased urban population are two major concerns for society. Moving towards more sustainable energy solutions in the urban context by integrating renewable energy technologies supports decarbonizing the energy sector and climate change mitigation. A successful transition also needs adequate consideration of climate change including extreme events to ensure the reliable performance of energy systems in the long run. This review provides an overview of and insight into the progress achieved in the energy sector to adapt to climate change, focusing on the climate resilience of urban energy systems. The state-of-the-art methodology to assess impacts of climate change including extreme events and uncertainties on the design and performance of energy systems is described and discussed. Climate resilience is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to represent the durability and stable performance of energy systems against extreme climate events. However, it has not yet been adequately explored and widely used, as its definition has not been clearly articulated and assessment is mostly based on qualitative aspects. This study reveals that a major limitation in the state-of-the-art is the inadequacy of climate change adaptation approaches in designing and preparing urban energy systems to satisfactorily address plausible extreme climate events. Furthermore, the complexity of the climate and energy models and the mismatch between their temporal and spatial resolutions are the major limitations in linking these models. Therefore, few studies have focused on the design and operation of urban energy infrastructure in terms of climate resilience. Considering the occurrence of extreme climate events and increasing demand for implementing climate adaptation strategies, the study highlights the importance of improving energy system models to consider future climate variations including extreme events to identify climate resilient energy transition pathways.},

The analysis used local cooling and heating degree-day data. The main results are as follows: (1) Most of the largest metropolitan areas are in developing countries (38 out of 50), and most of them, in turn, are in warm to hot climates. (2) All but two of the top 30 metropolitan areas in terms of cooling degree days are in developing countries. (3) The potential cooling demands are greater than heating demands in most of the metropolitan areas that are in developing countries (24 out of 38). The main implication of these findings is that increasing personal income is likely to lead to an unprecedented increase in energy demand in many developing countries. For example, the potential cooling demand in metropolitan Mumbai is about 24\% of the demand for the entire United States.},

	abstract = {Existing state-level models relating climate parameters to residential electricity consumption indicate a nominal sensitivity of 2–4\% for each degree Celsius increase in ambient temperatures. Long-term climate change will also impact electricity consumption through corresponding increases in the market saturation of air conditioning. In this paper we use air conditioning market saturation data for 39 US cities to develop a generalized functional relationship between market saturation and cooling degree days. The slope of this saturation curve is particularly high for cities that currently have low to moderate saturation. As a result, the total response of per capita electricity consumption to long-term warming may be much higher than previously thought. A detailed analysis of 12 cities in four states shows that for some cities changes in market saturation may be two to three times more important than the role of weather sensitivity of current loads. While actual behavioral response to climate change will be more complicated than that captured in our model of market saturation, this approach provides a new perspective on the sensitivity of space conditioning electricity consumption in the US to climate change.},

They had left Heaven for a new economic world. A world where, although blessed with a large dowry and patrimony [1], directly available resources were scarce. Air for breathing was available everywhere and so was water: water for drinking and washing, but not in all places and not always of the desired quality. Rivers and lakes then became privileged places for human settlements. The problem of finding food could first be solved through hunting and gathering. But all this was of limited efficiency when population density increased. The first economic revolution started with the beginning of agriculture. The descendants of Adam and Eve had learnt by then that most resources do not only exist per se, but also as a consequence of human knowledge and understanding of the environment inhabited by man and of the technologies he is able to develop.},

	abstract = {Paleoclimate data show that climate sensitivity is {\textasciitilde}3°C for doubled CO2, including only fast feedback processes. Equilibrium sensitivity, including slower surface albedo feedbacks, is {\textasciitilde}6°C for doubled CO2 for the range of climate states between glacial conditions and ice-free Antarctica. Decreasing CO2 was the main cause of a cooling trend that began 50 million years ago, the planet being nearly ice-free until CO2 fell to 450 ± 100 ppm; barring prompt policy changes, that critical level will be passed, in the opposite direction, within decades. If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that. The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes of non-CO2 forcings. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon. If the present overshoot of this target CO2 is not brief, there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects.},

Potential decisions can range from the installation of demand-side measures to the replacement of energy supply systems and combinations therewithin. The classical decision theories of Wald, Savage, and Hurwicz are used to perform non-probabilistic optimisation under both technical and economic uncertainty.

However, adoption of these technologies may exacerbate issues related to mismatch of electricity supply and demand. In this study, we utilize a hybrid capacity expansion and dispatch model to quantify grid impacts of the conversion of the entire road vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2050. We examine impacts of policies, such as targeting a renewable energy penetration of 93\%, using British Columbia as a case study. Scenarios making use of utility controlled charging of vehicles to balance supply and demand are further analyzed. Results show that although electrifying the entire road vehicle fleet will require generation capacity to increase by up to 60\%, relative to a scenario without electrification, levelized cost of electricity only increases by 9\% in the same scenario due to availability of low cost generation options such as wind and solar. We also find that a 93\% renewable energy target leads to carbon abatement costs 30\% lower than a scenario where this policy is removed. Further use of utility controlled charging reduces total system capacity up to 7\%.},

We assume that this hypothetical population is technologically stationary and agriculturally based, and estimate climate impacts as fractional decreases in economic activity, potentially amplified by a human population response to a diminished human carrying capacity. Monetary costs are converted to units of present-day dollars by multiplying the future damage fractions by the present-day global world production, and integrated through time with no loss due from time-preference discounting. Ultimate costs of C range from \$10k to \$750k per ton for various assumptions about the magnitude and longevity of economic impacts, with a best-estimate value of about \$100k per ton of C. Most of the uncertainty arises from the economic parameters of the model and, among the geophysical parameters, from the climate sensitivity. We argue that the ultimate cost of carbon is a first approximation of our potential culpability to future generations for our fossil energy use, expressed in units that are relevant to us.},

	abstract = {Elicitation is a key task for subjectivist Bayesians. Although skeptics hold that elicitation cannot (or perhaps should not) be done, in practice it brings statisticians closer to their clients and subject-matter expert colleagues. This article reviews the state of the art, reflecting the experience of statisticians informed by the fruits of a long line of psychological research into how people represent uncertain information cognitively and how they respond to questions about that information. In a discussion of the elicitation process, the first issue to address is what it means for an elicitation to be successful; that is, what criteria should be used. Our answer is that a successful elicitation faithfully represents the opinion of the person being elicited. It is not necessarily “true” in some objectivistic sense, and cannot be judged in that way. We see that elicitation as simply part of the process of statistical modeling. Indeed, in a hierarchical model at which point the likelihood ends and the prior begins is ambiguous. Thus the same kinds of judgment that inform statistical modeling in general also inform elicitation of prior distributions. The psychological literature suggests that people are prone to certain heuristics and biases in how they respond to situations involving uncertainty. As a result, some of the ways of asking questions about uncertain quantities are preferable to others, and appear to be more reliable. However, data are lacking on exactly how well the various methods work, because it is unclear, other than by asking using an elicitation method, just what the person believes. Consequently, one is reduced to indirect means of assessing elicitation methods. The tool chest of methods is growing. Historically, the first methods involved choosing hyperparameters using conjugate prior families, at a time when these were the only families for which posterior distributions could be computed. Modern computational methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, have freed elicitation from this constraint. As a result, now both parametric and nonparametric methods are available for low-dimensional problems. High-dimensional problems are probably best thought of as lacking another hierarchical level, which has the effect of reducing the as-yet-unelicited parameter space. Special considerations apply to the elicitation of group opinions. Informal methods, such as Delphi, encourage the participants to discuss the issue in the hope of reaching consensus. Formal methods, such as weighted averages or logarithmic opinion pools, each have mathematical characteristics that are uncomfortable. Finally, there is the question of what a group opinion even means, because it is not necessarily the opinion of any participant.},

Different heatwave definitions were evaluated in terms of their impacts on the risk of heat-related deaths in non-air conditioned buildings. This study found out a heatwave criterion suitable for the creation of future Hot Event Years (HEYs) for use in building resilience assessment against deadly heatwaves. Building practitioners will find future HEYs useful in providing building adaptations to ensure safe indoor environment against changing climate.},

	abstract = {During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.},

The peak daily average heating and cooling loads are typically below 10W/m2 and annual useful energy demands are below 15kWh/(m2a). The Passive House standard was originally developed in Germany. In this paper we show by hygro-thermal dynamic simulation that it is possible to realize residential Passive Houses in all of the world's relevant climate zones, represented here by Yekaterinburg, Tokyo, Shanghai, Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore. The window quality, insulation levels, and mechanical services all depend on the climate as well as on the building's shape and orientation. The resulting annual energy demand for space conditioning of the Passive Houses is 75 to 95\% lower than that of a traditionally insulated building of the same geometry. In humid climates like Shanghai or Singapore, special attention must be paid to humidity aspects. In climates which are hot and humid all year long, the total useful energy demand for sensible and latent cooling may exceed 70kWh/(m2a) even in a Passive House. Finally, it is shown that the architectural quality is not compromised by the Passive House requirements.},

In this paper, advantages of using green roofs were assessed and the findings of recent researches about the relationship between green roofs and energy consumption in buildings were reviewed. Results of reviewed studies show that thermal behavior of green roof is subject of different conditions like type and thickness of growing medium, leaf area index and density of vegetation, ceiling temperature transfer coefficient, R-value of roof, and climate of studied region.

	abstract = {Robust decision-making is being increasingly used to support environmental resources decisions and policy analysis under changing climate and society. In this context, a robust decision is a decision that is as much as possible insensitive to a large degree of uncertainty and ensures certain performance across multiple plausible futures. Yet, the concept of robustness is neither unique nor static. Multiple robustness metrics, such as maximin, optimism-pessimism, max regret, have been proposed in the literature, reflecting diverse optimistic/pessimistic attitudes by the decision maker. Further, these attitudes can evolve in time as a response to sequences of favorable (or adverse) events, inducing possible dynamic changes in the robustness metrics. In this paper, we explore the impact of alternative definitions of robustness and their evolution in time for a case of water resources system management under changing climate. We study the decisions of the Lake Como operator, who is called to regulate the lake by balancing irrigation supply and flood control, under an ensemble of climate change scenarios. Results show a considerable variability in the system performance across multiple robustness metrics. In fact, the mis-definition of the actual decision maker’s attitude biases the simulation of its future decisions and produces a general underestimation of the system performance. The analysis of the dynamic evolution of the decision maker’s preferences further confirms the potentially strong impact of changing robustness definition on the decision-making outcomes. Climate change impact assessment studies should therefore include the definition of robustness among the uncertain parameters of the problem in order to analyze future human decisions under uncertainty.},

Writing these two volumes over ten years, Kalman has produced a rich panorama, treating the vast range of Canadian building from the dwellings of the native peoples and the first settlers to buildings of the recent past and the present day. Describing the country's architectural history in a lucid and interesting narrative, and placing the buildings firmly in a social and cultural context, Kalman brings to light some distinctive characteristics of Canadian architects and architecture: a respect for nature, natural forms, and local materials; the tendencies to absorb ideas from abroad and then simplify and restrain them, and to take a middle position between extreme modernism and extreme traditionalism; the development of marked regional differences; and the flair for producing innovations in response to social issues.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on assessing the heat transfer rate and structural stability of a novel self-operating energy pile based on the principle of a thermo-syphon. Specifically, this new energy pile, referred to as a “thermo-syphon helical pile” (THP), is formed by pressurizing a hollow helical pile with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form a heat pipe, where spontaneous liquid-vapor phase change and natural convection inside the pile will facilitate self-operating heat transfer from the pile tip to the pile head. Based on the theories of heat transfer and fluid dynamics, a simplified analytical solution was developed to calculate the heat transfer rates within THPs with different geometries, which can be further converted into equivalent thermal conductivities. The results indicate that heat transfer within THPs is a function of the boundary temperature applied to the pile head, CO2 pressure, working fluid properties, and THP geometry. The results also revealed that the equivalent thermal conductivity of the THP is 1000 times higher than that of most metals due to the latent heat transfer of working fluid. An analysis of the structural stability of a THP under pressure indicates that bifurcation is not a problem if the ratio of the diameter to thickness of a THP is less than 90. While this analytical feasibility study demonstrates that THPs are a promising alternative for energy piles for both new and retrofitted buildings, future studies on soil-pile thermal and mechanical interaction under operational thermal gradients are needed to evaluate the range of heat transfer rates from the subsurface to a building when using a THP.},

	abstract = {The 1980s oil glut was a serious surplus of crude oil caused by falling demand following the 1970s energy crisis. The world price of oil had peaked in 1980 at over US\$35 per barrel (equivalent to \$109 per barrel in 2019 dollars, when adjusted for inflation); it fell in 1986 from \$27 to below \$10 (\$63 to \$23 in 2019 dollars). The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries due to the crises of the 1970s, especially in 1973 and 1979, and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices. The inflation-adjusted real 2004 dollar value of oil fell from an average of \$78.2 in 1981 to an average of \$26.8 per barrel in 1986.In June 1981, The New York Times proclaimed that an "oil glut" had arrived and Time Magazine stated that "the world temporarily floats in a glut of oil". However, The New York Times warned the next week that the word "glut" was misleading, and that temporary surpluses had brought down prices somewhat, but prices were still well above pre-energy crisis levels. This sentiment was echoed in November 1981, when the CEO of Exxon Corp also characterized the glut as a temporary surplus, and that the word "glut" was an example of "our American penchant for exaggerated language". He wrote that the main cause of the glut was declining consumption.  In the United States, Europe, and Japan, oil consumption had fallen 13\% from 1979 to 1981, "in part, in reaction to the very large increases in oil prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporters", continuing a trend begun during the 1973 price increases.After 1980, reduced demand and increased production produced a glut on the world market. The result was a six-year decline in the price of oil, which reduced the price by half in 1986 alone.},

The solar house is often understood as a product of the 1970s, and few people are aware of the influential experimental solar houses which were constructed during the previous four decades, beginning with the work of masters of twentieth-century architecture such as Richard Neutra, Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Paolo Soleri, Louis Kahn, Pietro Belluschi, Edward Durell Stone, and Harwell Hamilton Harris, and continuing with more recent innovations like the German Passivhaus movement and the Heliotrope, the first house to produce more energy than it consumed, and the U.S.-based Solar Decathlon, conceived as a living demonstration laboratory and recently expanded to include contests in Europe and China. Not only are these innovative projects the models for architects exploring environmentally conscious design today, they hold the imagination of the wider public, beginning with the idealism of the 1960s, the pragmatism that accompanied the energy crisis of the 1970s, and continuing into the twenty-first century with the demand for environmentally sustainable living.

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 × 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

Using a combination of in situ station measurements (Global Historical Climatology Network's Daily data set) and multiple other gridded data products, a derived 1° data set of growing season climate indices and extremes is compiled over the major growing regions for maize, wheat, soybean, and rice for 1951–2006. This data set contains growing season climate indices that are agriculturally relevant, such as the number of hot days, duration of dry spells, and rainfall intensity. Before 1980, temperature-related indices had few trends; after 1980, statistically significant warming trends exist for each crop in the majority of growing regions. In particular, crops have increasingly been exposed to extreme hot temperatures, above which yields have been shown to decline. Rainfall trends are less consistent compared to temperature, with some regions receiving more rainfall and others less. Anomalous temperature and precipitation conditions are shown to often occur concurrently, with dry growing seasons more likely to be hotter, have larger drought indices, and have larger vapor pressure deficits. This leads to the confluence of a variety of climate conditions that negatively impact crop yields. These results show a consistent increase in global agricultural exposure to negative climate conditions since 1980.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world have agreed to end hunger and food insecurity and to improve global nutrition, largely through changes to agriculture and food systems. However, they are faced with a lot of uncertainty when making policy decisions, since any agricultural changes will influence social and biophysical systems, which could yield either positive or negative nutrition outcomes. We outline a holistic probability modeling approach with Bayesian Network (BN) models for nutritional impacts resulting from agricultural development policy. The approach includes the elicitation of expert knowledge for impact model development, including sensitivity analysis and value of information calculations. It aims at a generalizable methodology that can be applied in a wide range of contexts. To showcase this approach, we develop an impact model of Vision 2040, Uganda's development strategy, which, among other objectives, seeks to transform the country's agricultural landscape from traditional systems to large-scale commercial agriculture. Model results suggest that Vision 2040 is likely to have negative outcomes for the rural livelihoods it intends to support; it may have no appreciable influence on household hunger but, by influencing preferences for and access to quality nutritional foods, may increase the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency. The results highlight the trade-offs that must be negotiated when making decisions regarding agriculture for nutrition, and the capacity of BNs to make these trade-offs explicit. The work illustrates the value of BNs for supporting evidence-based agricultural development decisions.},

Projects in the United States, and in many locations throughout the world, generally involve local jurisdictions raising the elevation of shoreline protection elements, with limited or no analysis of the feedback between shoreline management decisions and the impacts to water levels regionally. Our study examines the impact of local shoreline development on regional flood risk and considers SLR scenarios up to 1.5 m using a large-scale numerical model, as an example, for San Francisco Bay. Here we show that measures to prevent flooding along an embayment shoreline in one location or subregion may increase inundation elsewhere in the system. The network of interactions occurs not only within subbasins of the Bay but also across the greater geographic extent from one end of the Bay to the other, and local jurisdiction may have either reciprocal relationships with or asymmetric impacts on one other. Importantly, the nature of the interaction network is seen to evolve with SLR: interactions are purely subregional at current sea level but with higher sea level (e.g., 1 m of SLR), not only do the subregional interdependencies strengthen but also regional interdependences emerge.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades resilience has emerged as a promising concept that can help societies and more generally social-ecological systems become less vulnerable to shocks and stressors. As such it has been adopted by a large number of disciplines—from psychology, physics, and ecology to disaster risk reduction, climate change adaption, and humanitarian and food security interventions. However, although numerous definitions or measures of resilience have been proposed, those were mainly discipline centered and, as such, failed to provide an adequate overarching framework. This paper explores the question of the formalization and measurement of resilience, with the objective to develop a generic metric that applies across the disciplines and to the different interpretations of resilience. Building on the definitions found in the literature, a continuum of five categories of resilience responses is identified: (i) resistance, (ii) coping strategies, (iii) adaptation, (iv) adaptive preference, and (v) transformation. Those categories are then reframed into a generic metric, using viability analysis—a mathematical formalism which builds on dynamic systems and control theory. Theoretical and empirical analyses are then conducted, looking in particular at how inertia and costs associated with the types of responses influence the level of resilience. To illustrate this new metric, we draw on two models widely discussed in the resilience literature: the exploitation of renewable resources and the case of lake eutrophication. Both theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate the relevance of the typology as a generic framework for resilience but also highlight transformation as a particular case of resilience response.},

	abstract = {Communities in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin face the challenge of trying to achieve social, economic, and environmental sustainability; but experience entrenched conflict about the best way to achieve a sustainable future, especially for small rural communities. Integral ecology is a philosophical concept that seeks to address community, economic, social, and environmental sustainability simultaneously. Its inclusive processes are designed to reduce stakeholder conflict. However, to date the application of the integral ecology concept has been largely qualitative in nature. This study developed a quantitative integral ecology framework, and applied this framework to a case study of the Riverina, in the Murray-Darling Basin. Seventy-seven community-focused initiatives were assessed, ranked, and quantified. The majority of the community-focused ranked initiatives did not exhibit all aspects of integral ecology. Initiatives typically prioritized either (1) economic and community development or (2) environmental health; rarely both together. The integral ecology framework developed here enables recommendations on future community initiatives and may provide a pathway for community leaders and other policy-makers to more readily apply integral ecology objectives. Further research refining the framework's operationalization, application and implementation to a wider-scale may enhance communities' capacity to develop and grow sustainably.},

	abstract = {Systemic threats to food-energy-environment-water systems require national policy responses. Yet complete control of these complex systems is impossible and attempts to mitigate systemic risks can generate unexpected feedback effects. Perverse outcomes from national policy can emerge from the diverse responses of decision-makers across different levels and scales of resource governance. Participatory risk assessment processes can help planners to understand subnational dynamics and ensure that policies do not undermine the resilience of social-ecological systems and infrastructure networks. Researchers can play an important role in participatory processes as both technical specialists and brokers of stakeholder knowledge on the feedbacks generated by systemic risks and policy decisions. Here, we evaluate the use of causal modeling and participatory risk assessment to develop national policy on systemic water risks. We present an application of the Risks and Options Assessment for Decision-Making (ROAD) process to a district of Vietnam where national agricultural water reforms are being piloted. The methods and results of this project provide general insights about how to support resilient decision-making, including the transfer of knowledge across administrative levels, identification of feedback effects, and the effective implementation of risk assessment processes.},

However, this cost-benefit approach may not guarantee robustness under uncertain future conditions, for instance under climatic changes. In this paper, we expand risk-based decision analysis to explore possible ways of enhancing robustness in engineered water resources systems under different risk attitudes. Risk is measured as the expected annual cost of water use restrictions, while robustness is interpreted in the decision-theoretic sense as the ability of a water resource system to maintain performance—expressed as a tolerable risk of water use restrictions—under a wide range of possible future conditions. Linking risk attitudes with robustness allows stakeholders to explicitly trade-off incremental increases in robustness with investment costs for a given level of risk. We illustrate the framework through a case study of London's water supply system using state-of-the -art regional climate simulations to inform the estimation of risk and robustness.},

	abstract = {Transboundary river basins experience complex coordination challenges during droughts. The multiscale nature of drought creates potential for spillovers when upstream adaptation decisions have cascading impacts on downstream regions. This paper advances the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework to examine drought adaptation decision-making in a multijurisdictional context. We integrate concepts of risk management into the IAD framework to characterize drought across its natural and human dimensions. A global analysis identifies regions where severe droughts combine with institutional fragmentation to require coordinated adaptation. We apply the risk-based IAD framework to examine drought adaptation in the Rio Bravo/Grande—an archetypical transboundary river shared by the United States and Mexico and by multiple states within each country. The analysis draws on primary data and a questionnaire with 50 water managers in four distinct, yet interlinked, “institutional catchments,” which vary in terms of their drought characteristics, socioeconomic attributes, and governance arrangements. The results highlight the heterogeneity of droughts and uneven distribution of their impacts due to the interplay of drought hazards and institutional fragmentation. Transboundary water sharing agreements influence the types and sequence of interactions between upstream and downstream jurisdictions, which we describe as spillovers that involve both conflict and cooperation. Interdependent jurisdictions often draw on informal decision-making venues (e.g., data sharing, operational decisions) due to the higher transaction costs and uncertainty associated with courts and planning processes, yet existing coordination and conflict resolution venues have proven insufficient for severe, sustained droughts. Observatories will be needed to measure and manage the cascading risks of drought.},

	abstract = {Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are a standard tool for policy analysis and forecasts of economic growth. Unfortunately, due to computational constraints, many CGE models are dimensionally small, aggregating countries into an often limited set of regions or using assumptions such as static price-level expectations, where next period's price is conditional only on current or past prices. This is a concern for climate change modeling, since the effects of global warming by country, in a fully disaggregated and global trade model, are needed, and the known future effects of global warming should be included in forward-looking forecasts for prices and profitability. This work extends a large dimensional intertemporal CGE trade model to account for the various effects of global warming (e.g., loss in agricultural productivity, sea level rise, and health effects) on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and levels for 139 countries, by decade and over the long term, where producers look forward and adjust price expectations and capital stocks to account for future climate effects. The potential economic gains from complying with the Paris Accord are also estimated, showing that even with a limited set of possible damages from global warming, these gains are substantial. For example, with the comparative case of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (4°C), the global gains from complying with the 2°C target (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5) are approximately US\$17,489 billion per year in the long run (year 2100). The relative damages from not complying to Sub-Sahara Africa, India, and Southeast Asia, across all temperature ranges, are especially severe.},

This water-energy-food-environment nexus is not confined to semiarid regions but is emerging as a key business, societal, and economic risk in humid and temperate countries, where abundant water supplies and regulation have historically coped with fluctuating demands between industry, power generation, agriculture, domestic supply, and the environment. In the United Kingdom, irrigation is supplemental to rainfall, consumptive in use, and concentrated in the driest years and most resource-stressed catchments. This paper describes an empirical application of a mixed methods approach to integrate agriculture into a robust decision-making framework, focusing on a water-stressed region in England. The approach shows that competing demands between sectors can be reconciled and that potential options or portfolios compatible with multisectoral collaboration and investment can be identified. The methodological challenges in forecasting agricultural demand, defining acceptable trade-offs, managing scale and uncertainty issues, and the importance of engendering open dialogue between stakeholders are described. The study provides valuable insights for countries where similar emergent issues regarding conflicts over water demand exist.},

	abstract = {Managing integrated social-ecological systems to reduce risks to human and environmental well-being remains challenging in light of the rate and extent of undesirable changes that are occurring. Developing frameworks that are sufficiently integrative to guide research to deliver the necessary insights into all key system aspects is an important outstanding task. Among existing approaches, resilience and nexus framings both allow focus on unpacking relationships across scales and levels in a system and emphasize the involvement of different groups in decision making to different extents. They also suffer weaknesses and neither approach puts social justice considerations explicitly at its core. This has important implications for understanding who wins and loses out from different decisions and how social and ecological risks and trade-offs are shared and distributed, temporally and spatially. This paper conceptually integrates resilience and nexus approaches, developing a combined framework and indicating how it could effectively be operationalized in cases from mountain and mangrove social-ecological systems. In doing so, it advances understanding of complex social-ecological systems framings for risk-based decision making beyond that which could be achieved through use of either resilience or nexus approaches alone. Important next steps in testing the framework involve empirical and field operationalization, requiring interdisciplinary, mixed method approaches.},

The issue of how to balance these competing uses of water is of fundamental importance, especially with projected increases in the variability of water resources due to climate change. In response, a stochastic resilience optimization model is developed to assist decision-makers to optimally determine water releases from storages for environmental purposes and to measure the resilience of a system for given risk tolerances. The model, with sensitivity analyses, provides a valuable tool for water planners to minimize the risk of irreversible consequences and to optimize for resilience taking into account weather uncertainty, existing environmental conditions, and water storage levels. A calibration of the model to the Murray-Darling Basin and also the Goulburn-Broken catchment region in Australia highlights its potential to improve decision-making at multiple spatial scales and over time.},

	abstract = {Robustness is being used increasingly for decision analysis in relation to deep uncertainty and many metrics have been proposed for its quantification. Recent studies have shown that the application of different robustness metrics can result in different rankings of decision alternatives, but there has been little discussion of what potential causes for this might be. To shed some light on this issue, we present a unifying framework for the calculation of robustness metrics, which assists with understanding how robustness metrics work, when they should be used, and why they sometimes disagree. The framework categorizes the suitability of metrics to a decision-maker based on (1) the decision-context (i.e., the suitability of using absolute performance or regret), (2) the decision-maker's preferred level of risk aversion, and (3) the decision-maker's preference toward maximizing performance, minimizing variance, or some higher-order moment. This article also introduces a conceptual framework describing when relative robustness values of decision alternatives obtained using different metrics are likely to agree and disagree. This is used as a measure of how “stable” the ranking of decision alternatives is when determined using different robustness metrics. The framework is tested on three case studies, including water supply augmentation in Adelaide, Australia, the operation of a multipurpose regulated lake in Italy, and flood protection for a hypothetical river based on a reach of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. The proposed conceptual framework is confirmed by the case study results, providing insight into the reasons for disagreements between rankings obtained using different robustness metrics.},

	abstract = {Geographers and Geography has long been acquainted with the idea of climate. For much of the last century, climatology was one of the canonical sub-fields of physical geography and interactions between climate and the human world have proved fruitful sites of geographical inquiry. Although much contemporary scholarship and applied science is concerned with the idea of climate change, I believe there is important work still to be done on enriching the idea of climate. The argument put forward in this essay is that climate ? as it is imagined and acted upon ? needs to be understood, first and foremost, culturally. Rather than framing climate as an interconnected global physical system or as a statistical artefact of weather measurements, climate should be understood equally as an idea that takes shape in cultures and can therefore be changed by cultures. Climate has a cultural history, which is interwoven with its physical history. It is a history which forms the substrate out of which today's beliefs, claims and disputes about climate change emerge. This essay develops two core arguments. First, climate can be understood culturally, as an idea that humans use to stabilise relationships between weather and their patterned lives. In its various manifestations around the world, the idea of climate enables humans to live with their weather through a widening and changing range of cultural resources, practices, artefacts and rituals. Second, I argue that such a cultural understanding of climate alters the way the contemporary idea of climate change should be conceived; not primarily as a physical process which must be stopped, but as the latest stage in the cultural evolution of the idea of climate.},

A statistical analysis of semi-subterranean whale bone houses from two Thule sites in the Canadian High Arctic reveals architectural variability which reflects the use of two distinctive building strategies. I argue that these two strategies reflect attempts by Thule builders to accommodate (1) fluctuations in the availability of key building materials, and (2) differences in the anticipated use-life of a dwelling.
The spatial analysis of semi-subterranean whalebone houses and composite snow houses demonstrates that the spatial organization of each house form is generated by a different space syntax, or set of 'rules' which define how spaces are combined together. I argue that each space syntax reflects the distinctive socioeconomic configuration of Thule and Historic Inuit families.
The implication that social processes are reflected in the spatial organization of traditional Inuit architecture is then used as a baseline for understanding the impact that Euro-Canadian architecture has had on traditional Inuit households during the Settlement Era (1950 to present). I argue that the spatial organization of traditional Inuit houses and Euro-Canadian houses are generated by different space syntaxes; each reflecting the differing socioeconomic configuration of Inuit and Euro-Canadian families. As a consequence of this, I contend that Euro-Canadian house designs and housing programs effectively undermined the solidarity of the traditional Inuit extended family (Ilagiit), and fostered the ascendancy of the nuclear family; a household form favored by the Canadian Government for administrative purposes.},

There may have been some borrowing from Indian sources by early French-speaking settlers, but most forms seem to have been imported from the home country, with subsequent Canadian development. Expulsion of the Acadians obliterated early forms in Maritime Canada. Stone characterizes most of the surviving early forms in the St. Lawrence Valley, although fur trade personnel from the latter area carried their traditional techniques of log construction westward. English-speaking settlers of Ontario brought with them log dwellings of Pennsylvania origin. The same basic technique of handling logs in their dwellings was later carried westward and northward where it displaced that of the earlier fur trade. Other ethnic groups, in the Prairie Provinces, especially, introduced distinctive log dwellings at least in their initial settlement. Log dwellings are still numerous and widespread in Canada, but in most cases they now are based on the techniques from Pennsylvania rather than those from the St. Lawrence Valley.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the main characteristics of the RCP8.5 scenario. The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W/m2). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution.},

	abstract = {Low exergy buildings employ heating and cooling systems that match the building’s energy requirements to an energy source of optimal quality. It does not make sense to use high-temperature combustion (high-quality energy) to heat a room to 20 °C. Alternatively, a heat pump is an appropriate low exergy technology that exploits renewable, low-value heat sources. When the heat source (ground, water, solar, waste-heat) is relatively close to the heating supply temperature, very large amounts of heat per unit electricity can be moved. This efficiency is derived from the direct relationship between heat pump performance (COP) and temperature-lift. The key to realizing the benefits of low exergy systems lies in low temperature-lift, and the subsequent ultra-high COP that heat pumps can provide. As more low exergy systems enter the market, the potential for these heat pumps grows. In our research we present this potential and demonstrate how this active concept outperforms popular passive techniques.},

	abstract = {Logistical constraints can limit the number of global climate model (GCM) simulations considered in a climate change impact assessment. When dealing with annual or seasonal variables, one can visualize and manually select GCM scenarios to cover as much of the ensemble’s range of changes as possible. Most environmental systems are sensitive to climate conditions (e.g., extremes) that cannot be described by a small number of variables. Instead, algorithms like k-means clustering have been used to select representative ensemble members. Clustering algorithms are, however, biased toward high-density regions of climate variable space and tend to select scenarios that describe the central tendency rather than the full spread of an ensemble. Also, scenarios selected via clustering may not be ordered: that is, scenarios in the five-cluster solution may not appear in the six-cluster solution, which makes recommending a consistent set of scenarios to researchers with different needs difficult. Alternatively, an automated procedure based on a cluster initialization algorithm is proposed and applied to changes in 27 climate extremes indices between 1986–2005 and 2081–2100 from a large ensemble of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations. Selections by the method are ordered and are designed to span the overall range of the ensemble. The number of scenarios required to account for changes spanned by at least 90\% of the CMIP5 ensemble members is reported for 21 regions of the globe and compared with k-means clustering. On average, the proposed method requires 40\% fewer scenarios to meet this threshold than k-means clustering does.},

	abstract = {Quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artificially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modification of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quantities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algorithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inflate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremes with respect to the raw GCM, often substantially, as compared to DQM and especially QDM. The degree of corruption in the GCM trends by QM is particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of +500\% with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, with maximum changes by DQM and QDM nearing +240\% and +140\%, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed +120\%.},

	abstract = {Ensemble forecasts aim to improve decision-making by predicting a set of possible outcomes. Ideally, these would provide probabilities which are both sharp and reliable. In practice, the models, data assimilation and ensemble perturbation systems are all imperfect, leading to deficiencies in the predicted probabilities. This paper presents an ensemble post-processing scheme which directly targets local reliability, calibrating both climatology and ensemble dispersion in one coherent operation. It makes minimal assumptions about the underlying statistical distributions, aiming to extract as much information as possible from the original dynamic forecasts and support statistically awkward variables such as precipitation. The output is a set of ensemble members preserving the spatial, temporal and inter-variable structure from the raw forecasts, which should be beneficial to downstream applications such as hydrological models. The calibration is tested on three leading 15-d ensemble systems, and their aggregation into a simple multimodel ensemble. Results are presented for 12 h, 18 scale over Europe for a range of surface variables, including precipitation. The scheme is very effective at removing unreliability from the raw forecasts, whilst generally preserving or improving statistical resolution. In most cases, these benefits extend to the rarest events at each location within the 2-yr verification period. The reliability and resolution are generally equivalent or superior to those achieved using a Local Quantile-Quantile Transform, an established calibration method which generalises bias correction. The value of preserving spatial structure is demonstrated by the fact that 3)3 averages derived from grid-scale precipitation calibration perform almost as well as direct calibration at 3 )3 scale, and much better than a similar test neglecting the spatial relationships. Some remaining issues are discussed regarding the finite size of the output ensemble, variables such as sea-level pressure which are very reliable to start with, and the best way to handle derived variables such as dewpoint depression.},

We draw on that experience to identify questions and make propositions that should help make ensemble modeling with crop models more rigorous and informative. The propositions include defining criteria for acceptance of models in a crop MME, exploring criteria for evaluating the degree of relatedness of models in a MME, studying the effect of number of models in the ensemble, development of a statistical model of model sampling, creation of a repository for MME results, studies of possible differential weighting of models in an ensemble, creation of single model ensembles based on sampling from the uncertainty distribution of parameter values or inputs specifically oriented toward uncertainty estimation, the creation of super ensembles that sample more than one source of uncertainty, the analysis of super ensemble results to obtain information on total uncertainty and the separate contributions of different sources of uncertainty and finally further investigation of the use of the multi-model mean or median as a predictor.},

In architectural design optimization (ADO) practice and research, the most commonly applied black-box algorithms are genetic algorithms or other metaheuristics, to the neglect of more current, global direct search or model-based, methods. Model-based methods construct a surrogate model (i.e., an approximation of a fitness landscape) that they refine during the optimization process. This benchmark compares metaheuristic, direct search, and model-based methods, and concludes that, for the given evaluation budget and problems, the model-based method (RBFOpt) is the most efficient and robust, while the tested genetic algorithms perform poorly.

The evaluation of disaster resilience is based on dimensionless analytical functions related to the variation of functionality during a period of interest, including the losses in the disaster and the recovery path. This evolution in time including recovery differentiates the resilience approach from the other approaches addressing the loss estimation and their momentary effects. The recovery process usually depends on available technical and human resources, societal preparedness, public policies and may take different forms, which can be estimated using simplified recovery functions or using more complex organizational and socio-political models. Losses are described as functions of fragility of systems that are determined using multidimensional performance limit thresholds. The proposed framework is formulated and exemplified for a typical Californian Hospital building using a simplified recovery model, considering direct and indirect losses in its physical system and in the population served by the system. A hospital network is also analyzed to exemplify the resilience framework. Resilience function captures the effect of the disaster, but also the results of response and recovery, the effects of restoration and preparedness. Therefore, such a function becomes an important tool in the decision process for both the policy makers and the engineering professionals.},

First, the main assumptions behind the simplified model are presented. Then, CitySim is compared to other detailed simulation tools on case studies defined in the Building Energy Simulation Test (BESTEST) validation procedure. Finally, the predictions of CitySim regarding the annual heating load are compared with the monitored consumption of a building located on the campus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). Regarding the BESTEST, CitySim gives annual heating and cooling results together with peak heating and cooling loads that are within the acceptable range defined by reference simulation tools except for the annual heating load of case 960 and the peak cooling of case 610 but the differences are rather small (less than 1\%). Regarding the EPFL campus building, CitySim gives an annual heating consumption within a 5\% range of the monitored consumption of two reference years. The paper concludes that despite its simplified thermal model, CitySim results remain consistent with more detailed programs and the monitored heating consumption of an office building.

	abstract = {Neglecting extremes and designing buildings for the past or most likely weather conditions is not the best approach for the future. Robust design techniques can, however, be a viable option for tackling future challenges. The concept of robust design was first introduced by Taguchi in the 1940s. The result of the design process is a product that is insensitive to the effect of given sources of variability, even though the sources themselves are not eliminated. A robust design optimization (RDO) method is for the first time proposed in this paper, for supporting architects and engineers in the design of buildings with robust energy performance under climate change and extreme conditions. The simplicity and the low computational demand of the process underlies the feasibility and applicability of this method, which can be used at any stage of the design process. The results show that the performance of the optimum solution not only has a 81.5\% lower variation (less sensitivity to climate uncertainty) but at the same time has a 14.4\% lower mean energy use value compared with a solution that is compliant with a recent construction standard (ASHRAE 90.1-2016). Less sensitivity to climate uncertainty means greater robustness to climate change whilst maintaining high performance.},

	abstract = {The ‘water-energy-food (WEF) nexus’ has become an increasingly popular way to frame the challenges associated with reconciling improvements in human wellbeing and aspirations for better lives with sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems. Yet the nexus is complex, requiring effective engagement between expert and non-expert stakeholders in order to understand biophysical inter-linkages between resources and resource flows and social interactions between different actors in the socio-ecological system and landscape. This can be a substantial challenge due to varying levels of knowledge and understanding amongst actors with divergent, and often entrenched, interests. This paper presents insights on how participatory scenario-building processes can create space for dialogue amongst stakeholders with differing knowledge, experience, priorities and political perspectives. Drawing on completed and on-going research applying a ‘nexus toolkit’ in Ethiopia and Rwanda respectively, we contribute to a generalized conceptual framework for addressing, communicating, and assessing the water-energy-food nexus, with a particular focus on how to utilize the nexus concept in practice. We find that participatory scenario-building processes that facilitate engagement beyond technical aspects to include social, economic and political concerns provide a valuable space for discussing and negotiating development pathways that are sustainable both biophysically and socio-economically. In addition, the involvement of stakeholders throughout the project process greatly enhances the quality and legitimacy of results. Furthermore, we suggest that by building capacity amongst stakeholders to maintain a quantitative ‘nexus toolkit’, it has a better chance of informing decision-making and for supporting the development of more technically refined analyses of alternative decisions and management strategies.},

The results are based on the implementation using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model and are compared with a) other IMAGE implementations of the SSPs (SSP2 and SSP3) and b) the SSP1 implementation of other integrated assessment models. The results show that a combination of resource efficiency, preferences for sustainable production methods and investment in human development could lead to a strong transition towards a more renewable energy supply, less land use and lower anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2100 than in 2010, even in the absence of explicit climate policies. At the same time, climate policy would still be needed to reduce emissions further, in order to reduce the projected increase of global mean temperature from 3°C (SSP1 reference scenario) to 2 or 1.5°C (in line with current policy targets). The SSP1 storyline could be a basis for further discussions on how climate policy can be combined with achieving other societal goals.},

	abstract = {Studies of global environmental change make extensive use of scenarios to explore how the future can evolve under a consistent set of assumptions. The recently developed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) create a framework for the study of climate-related scenario outcomes. Their five narratives span a wide range of worlds that vary in their challenges for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Here we provide background on the quantification that has been selected to serve as the reference, or ‘marker’, implementation for SSP2. The SSP2 narrative describes a middle-of-the-road development in the mitigation and adaptation challenges space. We explain how the narrative has been translated into quantitative assumptions in the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modelling Framework. We show that our SSP2 marker implementation occupies a central position for key metrics along the mitigation and adaptation challenge dimensions. For many dimensions the SSP2 marker implementation also reflects an extension of the historical experience, particularly in terms of carbon and energy intensity improvements in its baseline. This leads to a steady emissions increase over the 21st century, with projected end-of-century warming nearing 4°C relative to preindustrial levels. On the other hand, SSP2 also shows that global-mean temperature increase can be limited to below 2°C, pending stringent climate policies throughout the world. The added value of the SSP2 marker implementation for the wider scientific community is that it can serve as a starting point to further explore integrated solutions for achieving multiple societal objectives in light of the climate adaptation and mitigation challenges that society could face over the 21st century.},

SSP3 (regional rivalry) forms the main focus of the study, which is supposed to face high challenges both in mitigation and adaptation. The AIM model has been selected as the model to quantify the SSP3 marker scenario, a representative case illustrating a particular narrative. Multiple parameter assumptions in AIM/CGE were differentiated across the SSPs for quantification. We confirm that SSP3 quantitative scenarios outcomes are consistent with its narrative. Moreover, four key features of SSP3 are observed. First, as SSP3 was originally designed to contain a high level of challenges to mitigation, mitigation costs in SSP3 were relatively high. This results from the combination of high greenhouse gas emissions in the baseline (no climate mitigation policy) scenario and low mitigative capacity. Second, the climate forcing level in 2100 for the baseline scenarios of SSP3 was similar to that of SSP2, whereas CO2 emissions in SSP3 are higher than those in SSP2. This is mainly due to high aerosol emissions in SSP3. A third feature was the high air pollutant emissions associated with weak implementation of air quality legislation and a high level of coal dependency. Fourth, forest area steadily decreases with a large expansion of cropland and pasture land. These characteristics indicate at least four potential uses for SSP3. First, SSP3 is useful for both IAM and impact, adaptation, vulnerability (IAV) analyses to present the worst-case scenario. Second, by comparing SSP2 and SSP3, IAV analyses can clarify the influences of socioeconomic elements under similar climatic conditions. Third, the high air pollutant emissions would be of interest to atmospheric chemistry climate modelers. Finally, in addition to climate change studies, many other environmental studies could benefit from the meaningful insights available from the large-scale land use change resulting in SSP3.},

The scenario family is characterized by rapid and fossil-fueled development with high socio-economic challenges to mitigation and low socio-economic challenges to adaptation (SSP5). A special focus is placed on the SSP5 marker scenario developed by the REMIND-MAgPIE integrated assessment modeling framework. The SSP5 baseline scenarios exhibit very high levels of fossil fuel use, up to a doubling of global food demand, and up to a tripling of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the century, marking the upper end of the scenario literature in several dimensions. These scenarios are currently the only SSP scenarios that result in a radiative forcing pathway as high as the highest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5). This paper further investigates the direct impact of mitigation policies on the SSP5 energy, land and emissions dynamics confirming high socio-economic challenges to mitigation in SSP5. Nonetheless, mitigation policies reaching climate forcing levels as low as in the lowest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6) are accessible in SSP5. The SSP5 scenarios presented in this paper aim to provide useful reference points for future climate change, climate impact, adaption and mitigation analysis, and broader questions of sustainable development.},

Therefore, the BcChart v2.0 software was developed. It executes bioclimatic potential analysis of a location based on the theory of Olgyay’s bioclimatic chart. The main advantage of the introduced tool, in contrast to other bioclimatic analysis tools, is that it directly considers the influence of solar radiation, which is factored through substitutive daily comfortable dry-bulb air temperature. The paper presents the theoretical background of the tool. Additionally, the capabilities and functionality of the software are demonstrated through bioclimatic analysis of two different locations with contrasting climates (i.e. Ljubljana, Slovenia and Abu Dhabi, UAE). The conclusions highlight the importance of considering solar radiation when performing bioclimatic analysis of a location in order to thoughtfully design bioclimatic buildings.},

The compressive strength, thermal properties and water resistance of mixtures of lime and the unfired binders, with and without hemp, were investigated. In general, for mixtures without hemp, replacing 50\% of the lime with an alternative binder resulted in a reduction in the compressive strength. However, when hemp was added, an optimal content of alternative binder was found, up to which a higher content of alternative binder led to improved properties (compressive strength and water resistance), but beyond which there was impairment of the properties. In summary, the higher the content of the alternative binder, the greater the LHC strength, while the density remains the same; however, at too low a lime content (here 10\% of the binder material) there was not enough lime to facilitate the formation of a continuous binding matrix within the sample, leading to a reduction in strength. Finally, the thermal properties of LHC were almost not affected by the replacement of the lime with an alternative binder.},

This was done by monitoring the internal temperature and relative humidity (RH) of test cells built with LHC and conventional materials, under real-time measured outdoor conditions, during summer and winter. It was found that all LHC cells with and without the alternative binders presented similar behavior, in terms of temperature as well as relative humidity. This means that LHC with alternative binders requires similar quantities of operational carbon (OC) and operational energy (OE) as LHC with 100\% lime; however, its embodied carbon (EC) and embodied energy (EE) are relatively lower so in total it requires less energy and is responsible for less CO2 emissions. As for the comparison with conventional building materials, AAC performs slightly better than LHC in the winter, but LHC performs better in the summer, while both AAC and LHC demonstrate better performance than HCB and EPS, in terms of temperature as well as relative humidity. It can be concluded that since LHC possesses relatively lower EC and EE as compared to conventional building materials, it has advantages in terms of energy savings, as well as CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {Improved greenhouse gas (GHG) emission efficiency of production has been proposed as one of the biggest potential advantages of cultured meat over conventional livestock production systems. Comparisons with beef are typically highlighted, as it is a highly emissions intensive food product. In this study we present a more rigorous comparison of the potential climate impacts of cultured meat and cattle production than has previously been made. Warming impacts are evaluated using a simple climate model that simulates the different behaviours of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), rather than relying on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) metrics. We compare the temperature impact of beef cattle and cultured meat production at all times to 1000 years in the future, using four synthetic meat GHG footprints currently available in the literature and three different beef production systems studied in an earlier climate modelling paper. Cattle systems are associated with the production of all three GHGs above, including significant emissions of CH4, while cultured meat emissions are almost entirely CO2 from energy generation. Under continuous high global consumption, cultured meat results in less warming than cattle initially, but this gap narrows in the long term and in some cases cattle production causes far less warming, as CH4 emissions do not accumulate, unlike CO2. We then model a decline in meat consumption to more sustainable levels following high consumption, and show that although cattle systems generally result in greater peak warming than cultured meat, the warming effect declines and stabilises under the new emission rates of cattle systems, while the CO2 based warming from cultured meat persists and accumulates even under reduced consumption, again overtaking cattle production in some scenarios. We conclude that cultured meat is not prima facie climatically superior to cattle production; its relative impact instead depends on the availability of decarbonised energy generation and the specific production systems that are realised.},

	abstract = {Plants and soil are natural regulators of atmospheric CO2. Whereas plants sequester atmospheric carbon, soils deposit it for decades. As cities become increasingly more densely built, the available land area for such ecosystem services may decrease. We studied seven different housing areas in the Finnish city of Espoo to ascertain the extent to which site efficiency affects to the ecosystem services if the full life-cycle GHG emissions of these areas are taken into account. The results show that the impact of CO2 uptake through carbon sinks in growing plants and the uptake of soil organic carbon vary greatly. Its share of all emissions varied from a marginal value of 1.2\% to a more considerable value of 11.9\%. The highest potential was calculated for a detached house located on a large site, while the weakest was calculated for compact apartment blocks. The study revealed that in order to quantify this potential more accurately, several knowledge gaps must first be addressed. These include impartial growth algorithms for Nordic wood species, missing accumulation factors for soil organic carbon in cold climates and statistical maintenance scenarios for gardens.},

One of the priority areas is the building stock, as it is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. COP23, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and an increasing number of countries are extending their consideration from aspects such as energy consumption and emissions from building operation to the manufacture of construction materials and building construction. The event offered an excellent platform to exchange ideas and thoughts on existing and planned environmental benchmarking schemes for buildings.},

	abstract = {Ways to long-term storage of carbon molecules captured as CO2 from atmosphere are looked for. Timber structures act as carbon storages and timber construction is sometimes claimed as a solution to mitigate climate change. This article attempts to estimate (a) the volume of carbon stored in wooden structures of new buildings annually, and (b) the role of new wooden buildings as a compensator of human-caused annual CO2 emissions in Finland and globally. Annual share from the total CO2 emissions stored in wooden buildings is called building sink eﬀect (BSE). The BSE was 0.61 in Finland in 2017, and global BSE is even smaller. In order to achieve a global BSE of 1\%, approximately 450 million m3 of wood products, corresponding to 85\% of the global production of lumber, all structural engineered wood and construction logs, should be long-term stored in buildings. New wooden buildings have almost indistinguishable mitigative inﬂuence on annual CO2 emissions. However, timber construction is an important factor in a strategy towards more climate smart future, and substitution eﬀects multiply the eﬀects of physical carbon storages. Still more powerful actions, such as emission cuts or reforestation, have to be implemented to see real climate eﬀects.},

	abstract = {The roles of forest management and the use of timber for energy in the global carbon cycle are discussed. Recent studies assert that past forest management has been accelerating climate change, for example in Europe. In addition, the increasing tendency to burn timber is an international concern. Here, we show a new way of carbon accounting considering the use of timber as a carbon neutral transfer into a pool of products. This approach underlines the robust, positive carbon mitigation effects of sustainable timber harvesting. Applying this new perspective, sustainable timber use can be interpreted not as a removal but a prevention of carbon being converted within the cycle of growth and respiration. Identifying timber use as a prevention rather than a removal leads to the understanding of timber use as being no source of carbon emissions of forests but as a carbon neutral transfer to the product pool. Subsequently, used timber will then contribute to carbon emissions from the pool of forest products in the future. Therefore, timber use contributes to carbon mitigation by providing a substantial delay of emissions. In a second step, the carbon model is applied to results of a previous study in which different timber price scenarios were used to predict timber harvests in Bavarian forests (Germany). Thus, the influence of the economic dimension “timber price” on the ecological dimension carbon sequestration was derived. It also shows that these effects are stable, even if an increasing tendency of burning timber products for producing energy is simulated. Linking an economic optimization to a biophysical model for carbon mitigation shows how the impact of management decisions on the environment can be derived. Overall, a sustainably managed system of forests and forest products contributes to carbon mitigation in a positive, stable way, even if the prices for (energy) wood rise substantially.},

Extracting climate data for specific locations from large datasets is not a trivial task and typically requires advanced GIS and data management skills. In this study, we developed a software package, ClimateNA, that facilitates this task and provides a user-friendly interface suitable for resource managers and decision makers as well as scientists. The software locally downscales historical and future monthly climate data layers into scale-free point estimates of climate values for the entire North American continent. The software also calculates a large number of biologically relevant climate variables that are usually derived from daily weather data. ClimateNA covers 1) 104 years of historical data (1901–2014) in monthly, annual, decadal and 30-year time steps; 2) three paleoclimatic periods (Last Glacial Maximum, Mid Holocene and Last Millennium); 3) three future periods (2020s, 2050s and 2080s); and 4) annual time-series of model projections for 2011–2100. Multiple general circulation models (GCMs) were included for both paleo and future periods, and two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and 8.5) were chosen for future climate data.},

We ﬁnd 5 that the scenarios span a wide range of end-of-century radiative forcing values, thus making this set of scenarios ideal for exploring a variety of warming pathways. The set of scenarios are bounded on the low end by a 1.9W m−2 scenario, ideal for analyzing a world with end-of-century temperatures well below 2°C, and on the high-end by a 8.5W m−2 scenario, resulting in an increase in warming of nearly 5°C over pre-industrial levels. Between these two extremes, scenarios are provided such that differences between forcing outcomes provide statistically signiﬁcant regional temperature outcomes to maximize their 10 usefulness for downstream experiments within CMIP6.

	abstract = {Building performance and solar energy system simulations are typically undertaken with standardised weather files which do not generally consider future climate predictions. This paper investigates the generation of climate change adapted simulation weather data for locations worldwide from readily available data sets. An approach is presented for ‘morphing’ existing EnergyPlus/ESP-r Weather (EPW) data with UK Met Office Hadley Centre general circulation model (GCM) predictions for a ‘medium–high’ emissions scenario (A2). It was found that, for the United Kingdom (UK), the GCM ‘morphed’ data shows a smoothing effect relative to data generated from the corresponding regional climate model (RCM) outputs. This is confirmed by building performance simulations of a naturally ventilated UK office building which highlight a consistent temperature distribution profile between GCM and RCM ‘morphed’ data, yet with a shift in the distribution. It is demonstrated that, until more detailed RCM data becomes available globally, ‘morphing’ with GCM data can be considered as a viable interim approach to generating climate change adapted weather data.},

This study investigates the influence of: environmental attitude, identity, and presence of green building features on students’ environmentally responsible behavior. Study was conducted at university campus settings. 121 residents of green and conventional student residences have completed a survey, answering the questions about their behaviors, beliefs, and the perception of green features in their residence. Green building features have been divided into two categories: visual and conceptual. The results of statistical analyses have shown that the main determinant of students’ behavior is the level of their environmental identity. Students who live in green residences declare lower environmental identity and less pro-environmental behaviors than students in conventional residences. In green residences, environmentally responsible behaviors are more frequent when students are aware of the presence of visual green building features. At the same time, despite declaring less pro-environmental behaviors, students in green dormitories feel they have become more pro-environmental since they moved to green dormitories. Implications of these findings are discussed, in the context of previous studies on architectural and psychological factors affecting environmentally responsible behaviors and in the context of moral licensing.},

	abstract = {MacNaughton et al. recently published an article entitled, “Energy savings, emissions reductions, and health co-benefits of the green building movement” in which they claim to calculate the environmental co-benefits associated with the (assumed) reduced energy use of green buildings. They consider only LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) commercial buildings and make two fundamental assumptions: (1) that each LEED building, year after year, achieves the energy savings projected by its design team, and (2) that the fuel mix of LEED buildings is the same as the average mix for other buildings in the same geographic region. Here we show that these assumptions are not supported by data. Numerous studies have shown that buildings, on average, use significantly more energy than projected by design simulations. Furthermore, a decade of research suggests that LEED-certified buildings, on average, achieve little or no primary energy savings relative to other similar buildings. In addition, evidence suggests that any reduction in site energy is typically achieved through increased electric use and corresponding off-site energy loss. The environmental benefits of LEED buildings calculated by MacNaughton et al. have dubious value because they are based on assumptions that are inconsistent with measured LEED building energy performance.},

We have cross-referenced the Chicago benchmarking data with the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED project database to identify 132 Chicago properties that were LEED-certified in programs expected to reduce whole building energy use. The numbers of LEED-certified buildings are sufficient for Offices, K-12 Schools, and Multifamily Housing to learn whether these buildings use less energy than do similar conventional buildings in Chicago. For all three building types we find LEED-certified buildings use no less source energy than similar buildings that are not LEED-certified. Further, we find that LEED-certified schools use 17\% more source energy than do other schools. For all three building types we find that LEED-certified buildings use roughly 10\% less energy on site than comparable conventional buildings. This does not translate into source energy savings because LEED-certified buildings use relatively more electric energy. Finally, when LEED-certified buildings are compared with other newer buildings we find their source energy consumption to be similar. We believe this is the first such study of energy performance for LEED-certified schools.},

Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a collection of factors that can negatively affect physical health in several ways. Besides physical health is also related to psychological well-being because the human body is one interactive biological system. This paper focuses on reviewing the current state of knowledge on building sickness syndrome which has been prevalent as a building illness since the 1970s especially in offices and schools. While the concepts of intelligent, smart and sustainable buildings have gained considerable attention during recent decades, there is now increasing attention being given to designing healthy buildings. This study provides a review about SBS symptoms. Several negative effects of SBS are identified and potential solutions are advocated. Finally, the study stresses the role of built environment and concludes that ongoing research towards tackling SBS and developing healthy indoor environments should not be limited to a single formula as any health-related building design approach is dependent on several interacting factors.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the building performance and develop a reliable building simulation, which will be employed in the second phase of the study: developing affordable and feasible passive design strategies to support the energy-efficient building systems of the construction industry. This paper reports on the results from the first phase of the study where a quantitative methodology, including indoor and outdoor environmental monitoring, in-situ measurements and building simulation modelling, was adopted. The performance of a case study was modelled and simulated via employing Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) software suite. The results from the base-case were analysed according to the adaptive thermal comfort of Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Technical Memorandum 52 guidelines: The Limits of Thermal Comfort—Avoiding Overheating in European Buildings. The spaces studied within the case study house were observed to exceed the acceptable limits of thermal comfort; particularly, the large bedroom within this zone exceeded the upper limit for overheating up to 11 h daily. Furthermore, the results from the monitoring study indicate a high risk of summertime overheating across all the case study settings, especially during short-term peaks in outdoor temperatures. The main reasons for the problematic thermal performance were identified as well-insulated and fully air-tight building fabric, the lack of sufficient ventilation through the living spaces and excessive heat gains through the composite cladding material.},

	abstract = {Vast quantities of energy are consumed in heating and cooling to provide what are now regarded as acceptable standards of thermal comfort. In the UK as in a number of other countries, there is a real danger that responses in anticipation of global warming and climate change – including growing reliance on air-conditioning – will increase energy demand and CO2 emissions even further. This is an appropriate moment to reflect on the history and future of comfort, both as an idea and as a material reality. Based on interviews and discussions with UK policy makers and building practitioners involved in specifying and constructing what will become the indoor environments of the future, four possible scenarios are identified each with different implications for energy and resource consumption. By actively promoting debate about the indoor environment and associated ways of life, it may yet be possible to avoid becoming locked into social and technical trajectories that are ultimately unsustainable. The aim of this paper is to inspire and initiate just such a discussion through demonstrating that comfort is a highly negotiable socio-cultural construct. e.shove@lancaster.ac.uk E-mail: heather.chappells@tiscali.co.uk},

The purposeof this approach has been potentially to contributeto illuminate a wide range of needs andundiscovered possibilities within the interrelatedfield of design, architecture and food; rangingfrom interior functions, building design, andcityscapes to industrial design and performativeactivities of the city.Reconsidering the public spaces of the city fromthe perspective of an architectural-food basedapproach implicit demands for an understandingof the inherited relations between the fieldsof respectively architectural design and culinaryarts. As such the first part of the paper outlinesconsiderations on contemporary food experiencesbased on two restaurant experiences and ahistorical study investigating the utilization ofarchitecture and design relative to creatingspectacular meal experiences, having a higherpurpose of developing social relations and supportingcultural development.Relative hereto, second part of the paper proposesto utilize the performative and sensuouselements of cooking in an architectural-foodbased approach as means to generate temporaryfood domains in the city, inviting for sensuousand explorative meal experiences further servinga cultural and social encouragementamong citizens. Taking our point of departure intwo specific cases developed at the Institute ofArchitecture and Design at Aalborg University,we will argue that small-scale urban experimentsare needed. With the two cases we furtherseek to illustrate how chefs in collaborationwith architectural designers methodically engagein the work of experience design within anew “sphere” of total-design, and how a combinationof performative experiences, food, plate,and room possibly can initiate social relations inpublic spaces.},

	abstract = {This research project aspires to make truly tall timber buildings a reality. Through a combination of theoretical design and physical testing this research demonstrates the viability of timber buildings at much greater heights than has previously been possible. By pushing the limits of theoretical designs into the realms of the supertall, sometimes beyond that which is feasible using current materials and construction technologies, this research also sets out the requirements for the next generation of engineered plant-based materials.The research is a collaboration between academics, practising architects and practising structural engineers. The approach is research through design, and design through research. Timber towers are designed well beyond existing heights, and analysed to understand how they stand up and which areas are most critical for further research. By bringing highly regarded architectural and structural designers together with the research capabilities of a leading university, this project creates a precedent-setting model for interdisciplinary engagement within and between the design and research communities. By coupling exemplary design in timber with a university’s research capacity, the project represents a real opportunity for transformational change in the design of tall timber buildings. Essential details and connections are determined and ‘unknowns’ with respect to material and structural performance are identified. A programme of testing to investigate these unknowns and validate the design approaches is carried out at the university. Outcomes of the test programme and new insights are fed back into the design process.The results show that tall timber towers are feasible, with substantial but surmountable questions outstanding. By providing thought provoking yet credible solutions for the design of tall timber buildings and exceeding current limits, the project can inspire the design community to think beyond the status quo and embrace the possibilities offered by timber construction.},

	abstract = {This paper describes recent progress in the utilization of participatory scenario-based backcasting approaches to sustainability research that blend quantitative and qualitative analyses in order to explore alternative climate change futures, as undertaken in a range of academic, government, and private sector projects in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. These projects reveal that buy-in to policy proposals may be enhanced by participation, but there is a risk of participants being overwhelmed by the complexity of the choices they are being asked to make. Furthermore, tools are grounded in a process, which must itself be the explicit focus of attention in designing successful backcasting projects and combining participatory backcasting techniques with more interactive processes that can enhance our ability to explore highly complex and uncertain, value-laden issues. These approaches can be used to drive action and support decision-making, but for a truly consultative and consensus-oriented process to occur, it is important that a broad sample of the community be engaged in the discussion that are equipped with technical knowledge or understanding of the goals of the process in order to participate in an equitable and effective fashion.},

	abstract = {Micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) systems have gained prominence in Europe and elsewhere, often attracting government incentives. Of the various micro-CHP technologies, Stirling engine (SE) systems are often preferred over internal combustion engines, but their economic and environmental sustainability is unclear. This study uses life cycle assessment and life cycle costing to analyze SE micro-CHP units, comparing the results to conventional natural gas boilers and grid electricity. Assuming highly-efficient operation (77 \% thermal; 13 \% electrical efficiency), the SE system is preferable to conventional electricity and heat both economically and environmentally (for nine of 11 impacts). However, at more realistic efficiencies (71 \% thermal; 6 \% electrical), the SE system is uncompetitive, being worse for seven environmental impacts, including global warming, and incurring 9 \% higher costs, despite subsidy. The choice of electricity, heat or combined output as a functional unit greatly affects the results. At low efficiencies, per unit of electricity, the SE system has on average 44 \% worse environmental performance than grid electricity. However, per unit of heat it is, on average, 30 \% better environmentally than the gas boiler, but the global warming potential (GWP) is 19 \% worse. For combined energy output, the SE system has on average 3 \% lower impacts than conventional alternatives, but the GWP is 16 \% higher. Future improvements to the environmental impacts of the electricity grid mix, including its decarbonization, would further reduce any relative benefits of the SE system, calling into question the suitability of subsidy.},

	abstract = {How climate change might impact energy demand is not well understood, yet energy forecasting requires that assumptions be specified. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between global warming and the demand for space cooling in buildings. It then estimates two key parameters that link energy for space cooling to cooling degree days (CDDs) using data for nine U.S. Census divisions, which is the spatial resolution of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). The first parameter is the set point temperature for calculating CDDs; the second is the exponent for representing the relationship between changes in CDDs and changes in electricity consumption for space cooling. We find that the best-fitting CDDs have a set point of 67 °F (19.4 °C), for both residential and commercial buildings, rather than the conventional 65 °F (18.3 °C). Set points also vary by region, with warmer regions tending to have higher set points. When CDDs are based on the conventional set point, the best fitting exponent is 1.5 for both residential and commercial buildings, indicating that space cooling is more climate-sensitive than is specified in NEMS. As a result, the official projections of U.S. energy consumption would appear to underestimate the energy required for space cooling.},

	abstract = {Between June and December of 2015, VanAir Design, in collaboration with Dr. Murray Hodgson and MApSc Vivek Shankar of UBC’s Acoustics and Noise Research Group (ANRG), studied airflow and sound transmission through vented thin panel partitions. The research is a continuation of separate work done by both VanAir and the ANRG. The focus application was ventilation openings for naturally ventilated buildings. As such, low pressure and low velocity airflow were investigated in more detail than before. The research was conducted in labs built for directly testing acoustical transmission loss and airflow on the same specimen installation, in full-size. First, four simple partition channel shapes were tested and evaluated; they were named ‘straight’, ‘L’, ‘U’, and ‘Z’. These tests provided justification for continuing detailed research into mainly the Z shape. By varying the dimensions of the Z channel and the arrangement of sound absorbing materials, many permutations were tested. The performance data was then organized into a test inventory spreadsheet, which can be used to design a vented partition for size, sound transmission, and ventilation requirements. The wings of the Center for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) building at UBC are naturally and mechanically ventilated, and therefore very low pressures drive airflow. In the original design, large open areas were left above the movable wall partitions for airflow, but these openings transmit sound which causes a distracting work environment. The operating conditions of these wings were studied, and six finish-quality vented partition prototypes were designed and installed in the openings of four meeting rooms. Finally, in situ measurements were taken to find the installed performance of the vented partitions and the new operating conditions of the meeting rooms.},

However, little is known about the consequences of the chronic ambient noise exposure at a level commonly encountered in residential urban areas. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the school performance of 8- to 9-year-old-children living in an urban environment and their chronic ambient noise exposure at home and at school. The children's school performances on the national standardized assessment test in French and mathematics were compared with the environmental noise levels. Children's exposure to ambient noise was calculated in front of their bedrooms (Lden) and schools (LAeq,day) using noise prediction modeling. Questionnaires were distributed to the families to collect potential confounding factors. Among the 746 respondent children, 586 were included in multilevel analyses. On average, the LAeq,day at school was 51.5 dB (SD= 4.5 dB; range = 38-58 dB) and the outdoor Lden at home was 56.4 dB (SD= 4.4 dB; range = 44-69 dB). LAeq,day at school was associated with impaired mathematics score (p = 0.02) or impaired French score (p = 0.01). For a + 10 dB gap, the French and mathematics scores were on average lower by about 5.5 points. Lden at home was significantly associated with impaired French performance when considered alone (p {\textless} 10(-3)) and was borderline significant when the combined home-school exposure was considered (p = 0.06). The magnitude of the observed effect on school performance may appear modest, but should be considered in light of the number of people who are potentially chronically exposed to similar environmental noise levels.},

At the nexus of three basic concepts (reducing contaminants at the source, improving ventilation, and, when relevant, purifying the indoor air), this approach can help maintain and improve indoor air quality and limit exposure to several contaminants. Its application is particularly relevant in a climate change context since the evolving outdoor conditions have to be taken into account during building construction and renovation. The measures presented through this approach target public health players, building managers, owners, occupants, and professionals involved in building design, construction, renovation, and maintenance. The findings of this review will help the various stakeholders initiate a strategic reflection on the importance of indoor air quality and climate change issues for existing and future buildings. Several new avenues and recommendations are presented to set the path for future research activities.},

	abstract = {“Architecture should thrive like a plant.” Gain insight into the philosophy of a frontrunner in sustainable architecture, Japanese architect Hiroshi Sambuichi, and hear how he created some of his unique, site-specific buildings.

Sambuichi lived close to nature as a child, at the Seto Inland Sea, and feels that this proximity developed his love of the water, the wind and the sun – elements which are crucial in his work: “The idea about buildings becoming one with the place really makes me happier than anything else and it probably originates from the experiences I had then.” It was thus a great honour for him, when he was asked to build an observatory in his home region. The theme he chose – for what was to become Mount Misen Observatory – was the Japanese expression ‘za’: to stop movement, find peace in your heart and see: “Instead of seeing moving things while you move, you see the moving things much better when you stop moving. If you sit down and watch the Seto Inland Sea it will be so beautiful.”

“The building should be dressed in soft rime.” When he was to build Rokkō Shidare Observatory (at a height of 1000 meters, making it the highest situated of all his buildings) perched on the top of Mount Rokkō in Kobe, Japan, Sambuichi studied the different states of water for a year. He wanted the building to become part of the surroundings and to avoid “forcing a building in modern materials upon nature.” The distinguishing outer frame of the building is composed of an intricate structure of wooden sticks within hexagonal frames. These frames are designed to attract frost in the winter, making them resemble large snowflakes. As a result, the observatory almost looks like an extension of the hill and reflects the most beautiful aspects of the place: “I take something that people already like and make them even more aware of it.” In continuation of this, Sambuichi doesn’t feel that his architecture enhances the surroundings but rather makes people appreciate them more.

“It is an art museum where everything is operated by nature.” For Inujima Seirensho Art Museum, Sambuichi chose to use only energy from the sun, wind and air, making the museum independent from the economical issues, which had affected the island of Inujima for years. The result was a unique museum where “the air is showing you around.” Moreover, the museum is so far as possible built from material, which was already there – e.g. blocks of slag found around the coast and an old chimney – combined with the moving materials of sun, water and air.

“It’s not as if I reject the splendour of technology. But it creates an architecture where you have to inject energy. But there is already plenty of energy there to use.” If a building is to exist for a long time, it has to fit the environment – “thrive like a plant” – and become one with the Earth’s cycle: “If new and young architects would think like that, the architecture in about one or two hundred years will grow like forests and become beautiful cities.”

Hiroshi Sambuichi (三分一インタビュー ) (b.1968) is a Japanese architect, who is considered one of the top experimentalists of sustainable architecture, creating a symbiosis between nature and architecture. Built upon both personal intuition and scientific investigations, his architecture attains a rare balance between poetics and science. In 2001 Sambuichi established Sambuichi Architects. He is currently an Honorary Professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture. In 2017 he was awarded the Wallpaper* Design Award for Naoshima Hall.

Hiroshi Sambuichi was interviewed by Christian Lund at Møstings Hus in connection with his installation ‘The Water’ at the Cisterns in Copenhagen, Denmark in March 2017.

              Designing lighting for zero-net energy buildings poses unique and fascinating design problems. Beyond the challenge of providing lighting loads on the order of .1W/sqft
              2
              , these projects require toolsets beyond the typical scope of a lighting design consultant, including detailed controls design and photometric predictions of available daylighting. These new roles are part of a broader trend in lighting design as, driven by new code requirements and a general push towards high-performing buildings, lighting design is becoming a more technical, metrics-driven profession. There's a delicate balancing act here, and indeed we have the same responsibility to these projects as any other: lighting that is comfortable and functional for the occupants, that supports the architectural gesture, and that is available within the project budget. So the task is not simply to design the absolute minimum energy density (although yes, also that), but rather to identify ways in which all of these constraints may be harmonized, and embrace the collaborative and iterative workflow that these projects demand.
            
            This case study is written for architects, engineers, owners and others that want an overview of the lighting design process for ultra-low energy density buildings. I'll gloss both the absolute basics and the more esoteric technical details in favor of discussing practical techniques that we used successfully to further the project goals, and the trade-offs we confronted.},

This consumption, together with that of other buildings, mainly from the tertiary sector, makes up 40\% of total energy consumption and 36\% of CO2 emissions. Artificial lighting makes up 14\% of electrical consumption in the European Union and 19\% worldwide. Through the use of well-designed natural lighting, controlled by technologies or systems which guarantee accessibility from all areas inside buildings, energy consumption for lighting and air conditioning can be kept to a minimum. The authors of this article carried out a state of the art on the technologies or control systems of natural light in buildings, concentrating on those control methods which not only protect the occupants from direct solar glare but also maximize natural light penetration in buildings based on the occupants׳ preferences, whilst allowing for a reduction in electrical consumption for lighting and cooling. All of the control and/or natural light guidance systems and/or strategies guarantee the penetration of daylight into the building, thus reducing the electrical energy consumption for lighting and cooling. At the same time they improve the thermal and visual comfort of the users of the buildings. However various studies have also brought to light certain disadvantages to these systems.},

In addition, he strongly contributed to the creation of a “European School” that addressed engineering issues and was well integrated with the American School, which was characterised (at that time) by a physiological approach. Ten years after his death, this paper is a memorial of his research in the field of thermal comfort and some aspects of indoor air quality.

	abstract = {Studies about thermal comfort in mixed-mode buildings have been performed in order to better understand this type of building and its influence on occupants’ thermal perception. However, there is still no consensus amongst researchers regarding whether mixed-mode buildings should be evaluated separating each mode of operation (natural ventilation or air-conditioning) and whether adaptive thermal comfort theory applies to both modes of operation. Does the mode of operation of a mixed-mode building, ceteris paribus, influence occupant thermal comfort perception? Trying to answer such questions, field studies on thermal comfort were conducted in three mixed-mode office buildings in the city of Florianópolis (a temperate and humid climate), Southern Brazil. Buildings were equipped with mechanical cooling systems and operable windows, both controlled by occupants. Thermal comfort questionnaires were collected at the same time and location that environmental variables were measured by microclimate instruments. Almost 5500 questionnaires were answered by occupants of the three buildings in both modes of operation over the four seasons. Analysis of the results indicated that occupants’ thermal perception was influenced by the mode of operation. Adaptive thermal comfort models were developed for natural ventilation and air-conditioning mode of mixed-mode buildings. This work found no evidence to support a single adaptive model for mixed-mode buildings. During natural ventilation mode, occupants adapted to indoor temperature fluctuations as predicted by the adaptive thermal comfort theory. On the other hand, during air-conditioning operation a weak adaptive relation (indoor comfort temperature vs. outdoor climate) was observed – a range of about 4°C of indoor temperature fluctuation may be used for the operation of the air-conditioning system without compromising thermal comfort, which could help saving energy. This work is a first step towards building an adaptive model of thermal comfort for Brazilian subtropical climate.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a study examining the potential of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector by substituting multi-storey steel and concrete building structures with timber structures. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to compare the climate change impact (CC) of a reinforced concrete (RC) benchmark structure to the CC of an alternative timber structure for four buildings ranging from 3 to 21 storeys. The timber structures are dimensioned to meet the same load criteria as the benchmark structures. The LCA comprises three calculation approaches differing in analysis perspective, allocation methods, and modelling of biogenic CO2 and carbonation of concrete. Irrespective of the assumptions made, the timber structures cause lower CC than the RC structures. By applying attributional LCA, the timber structures are found to cause a CC that is 34-84\% lower than the RC structures. The large span is due to different building heights and methodological assumptions. The CC saving per m2 floor area obtained by substituting a RC structure with a timber structure decrease slightly with building height up to 12 storeys, but increase from 12 to 21 storeys. From a consequential LCA perspective, constructing timber structures can result in avoided GHG emissions, indicated by a negative CC. Compared to the RC structures, this equal savings greater than 100\%.},

	abstract = {A recent study by the New Buildings Institute looked at the energy performance of 121 LEED certified commercial buildings and concluded they were saving 25-30\% energy relative to conventional buildings. Here we identify several critical flaws in the NBI analysis and, upon reexamination of the data, reach different conclusions. We find that the average energy consumption by LEED certified buildings is actually higher than the corresponding average for the US commercial building stock. This difference is shown to be largely due to the over-representation of “high-energy” principle building activities (PBA’s) such as laboratories and the under-representation of “low-energy” PBA’s such as non-refrigerated warehouses in the LEED building data set, relative to their occurrence in the U.S. commercial building stock. Eliminating high- and low-energy PBA’s from both data sets yields “medium-energy” building subsets free of these disparities. Comparing these we find that LEED medium energy buildings, on average, use 10\% less site energy but no less source (or primary energy) than do comparable conventional buildings. LEED office buildings achieve 17\% reduction in site energy, but again, no significant reduction in primary energy use relative to non-LEED office buildings. We further find that these results do not change significantly if LEED buildings are compared with newer vintage, non-LEED buildings. As green house gas (GHG) emission correlates with primary energy, not site energy, we conclude that LEED certification is not yielding any significant reduction in GHG emission by commercial buildings.},

Depending on which of these dates is used, the movement is no more than forty-four years old, and in the United States, attempts to set standards began only twenty years ago. The pattern is typical: as a young discipline or industry grows, competing definitions of success, failure, and quality come to the fore, gradually resolving into agreed standards.

	abstract = {Buildings contribute to climate change and other environmental harms, largely through resource use. Reducing demand for resources like energy and water has become a major goal of sustainable building. Green building rating systems like Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) present normative pathways to sustainability by rewarding certain types of activity deemed “sustainable.” One challenge is that rewards are often delinked from environmental outcomes. We demonstrate this delinkage with a California case study that shows variability in the implied carbon dioxide avoided per LEED energy or water efficiency point can span multiple orders of magnitude, even for similar building contexts. This variability is related both to issues that LEED already considers, like building type, and to supply chain issues not directly considered in LEED, like the electricity fuel mix for buildings and water infrastructure. Additional variability comes from the structure of point allocation itself. We suggest that in order to fulfill LEED's goal of improving linkages between points and priority outcomes, future iterations can and should more directly account for interconnected systems and supply chains, with a particular focus on regional context.

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years a number of studies have identified and provided explanations for a significant ‘performance gap' between designed and actual energy performance of buildings. The anticipated and achieved energy performance of an advanced, innovative building that aspired to net-positive energy performance is studied: the Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) building at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Selected performance ‘failures’ that became evident during operation of CIRS are studied for how they were discovered and the efforts required for their resolution: the energy systems and associated controls and monitoring. The key findings show the barriers were neither economic nor technical. Instead, the primary impediments were institutional regimes – arising from the ways that various life-cycle stages were specified, contracted and implemented. The key issues emphasize the importance of having meaningful and effective building energy monitoring capabilities, an understanding of energy system boundaries in design and analysis, crossing the gaps between different stages of a building life cycle, and feedback processes throughout design and operation. The disclosure of ‘failure’ and lessons learned is a valuable contribution to subsequent advancement for the building stakeholders and the wider professional and research communities.},

	abstract = {Backcasting as a scholarly and planning approach is increasingly used in futures studies in fields related to urban sustainability as an alternative to traditional planning approaches and a formal element of future strategic initiatives. It is viewed as a natural step in operationalizing sustainable development within different societal spheres. As a holistic urban development strategy, smart sustainable cities represent a manifestation of sustainable development as a process of change and a strategic approach to achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. Achieving smart sustainable cities represents an instance of urban sustainability, a concept that refers to a desired state in which a city strives to retain the balance of socio-ecological system through sustainable development as a desired trajectory. This long-term goal requires fostering linkages between scientific and social research, technological innovations, institutional practices, and policy design and planning in relevance to urban sustainability. It also requires a long-term vision, a transdisciplinary approach, and a system-oriented perspective on addressing environmental, economic, and social issues. These requirements are at the core of backcasting as an approach to futures studies. Backcasting is a special kind of scenario methodology to develop future models for smart sustainable city as a planning tool for urban sustainability. Goal-oriented backcasting approaches declare long-range targets that lie quite far in the future. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the goals of urban sustainability. The backcasting approach is found to be well-suited for long-term urban sustainability solutions due to its normative, goal-oriented, and problem-solving character. Also, it is particularly useful when dealing with complex problems and transitions, the current trends are part of the problem, and different directions of development can be allowed given the wide scope and long time horizon considered. A number of recent futures studies using backcasting have underlined the efficacy of this scholarly and planning approach in terms of indicating policy pathway for sustainability transitions and thus supporting policymakers and facilitating and guiding their actions. However, as there are a number of backcasting approaches used in different domains, and the backcasting framework is adaptive and contextual in nature, it is deemed highly relevant and useful to devise a scholarly and planning approach to strategic smart sustainable city development. This paper has a fourfold purpose. It aims (1) to provide a comparative account of the most commonly applied approaches in futures studies dealing with technology and sustainability (forecasting and backcasting); (2) to review the existing backcasting methodologies and discuss the relevance of their use in terms of their steps and guiding questions in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development as an area that is at the intersection of city development, sustainable development, and technology development; (3) to synthesize a backcasting approach based on the outcome of the review and discussion; and (4) to examine backcasting as a scholarly methodology and planning approach by looking at its use in the Gothenburg 2050 Project, as well as to use this case to illustrate the core of the synthesized approach. The synthesized scholarly and planning approach serves to help researchers and scholars in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development to assist planners, policymakers, and decision-makers in their endeavor to implement smart sustainable cities.},

CH2 presents that ultimate goal for sustainablitiy in architecture lies to provide better environment through energy saving and this implies the importance of applying sustainable design concept and integrated design approach in the early design stage. Innovative design of CH2 is the result of integrative design that various consultants participated as a form of design charrette. Most of integrative design of CH2 including biomimicry design concept, and innovative ventilation and cooling system come from design charrette process. Melbourne City strongly support the CH2 project because of its symbolic aspects of green policy and the green star system. As a result, CH2's success shows the effectiveness of integrative design in sustainable architecture that features multi-disciplinary characteristics. The availability of case study for integrative design lies in the fact that it can show a desirable direction and method for sustainable design.},

Our attempts to formulate some measure of daylight provision in buildings can be traced back over a century, and the daylight factor as we know it today is over 50 years old. Still the most common measure found in guidelines and recommendations worldwide, the daylight factor is used routinely and, it is fair to say, often rather uncritically. The consideration of daylight in buildings has received a new impetus from the accumulation of evidence on the wider benefits of daylight exposure. But it is continuing to prove difficult to advance beyond daylight factors towards a more realistic quantification of daylighting performance that would allow us to accommodate these new considerations in an evaluative schema. This paper examines the basis of current practice with respect to daylight evaluation, and suggests a few ways in which it can be improved with relatively modest additional effort. The paper also critiques some of the recent attempts to advance daylight evaluation by incremental means using so-called “clear sky options”.},

It is now widely accepted in the research community, and increasingly so amongst practitioners, that the standards/guidelines for daylight in buildings are in need of upgrading. The essence of the proposal is that the ‘target’ for daylight provision should be founded on the availability of daylight as determined from climate files. The proposal is in fact a refinement of an approach originally described in a CIE document from 1970, and which appears to have been largely overlooked since then. The proposal states that a design should achieve a target daylight factor at workplane height across a specified percentage of the relevant floor area for half of the daylight hours in the year, where the target daylight factor is based on the provision of 300 lux. A key feature of the refinements are the formulation of the methodology such that the likelihood for misinterpretation and ‘game-playing’ is greatly reduced, if not eliminated altogether. The method, founded on cumulative diffuse illuminance curves, could be introduced relatively swiftly since it requires only modest enhancement of existing daylight prediction tools. In addition, the proposal will provide a sound ‘footing’ for eventual progression to evaluations founded on full-blown climate-based daylight modelling.},

	abstract = {Addressing two common challenges for building performance – reducing the carbon footprint attached to the provision of comfortable indoor environments, and improving the health and wellbeing of occupants – requires a more comprehensive understanding of how the indoor environments of buildings are operated. This paper introduces SAMBA, a state-of-the-art monitoring station for continuous, real-time measurements of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) parameters from occupants’ work desks. It combines a hardware solution that integrates a low-cost suite of sensors with a software platform designed to automatically analyse and visualize data for quick interpretation of IEQ performance by non-scientist. In addition to feeding a massive IEQ database for research, the resulting data may be used to better inform the metrological requirements for popular international IEQ rating schemes. This new era of indoor environmental monitoring based upon systems such as SAMBA affords a fundamentally new approach to built environmental field research that holds significant promise to improve building performance and indoor environmental quality and occupant satisfaction, health, wellbeing and performance.},

This paper explores the possibilities of relating material experience in architecture to technical material parameters and uses the perceived warmth of indoor wall materials as a case study. Various building materials were assessed technically and their perceived warmth was evaluated by participants. As people experience a building and its materials through multiple senses, the separate effects of vision and touch were considered. Results show that the senses used for evaluation have a major impact on the perception of warmth, and that a distinction should be made between the visual warmth and tactile warmth of a material. The overall perception of warmth was shown to correspond to its visual perception. Furthermore, the perception of material warmth was correlated with several technical material parameters, such as the thermal effusivity, the surface gloss and the hue and saturation of the material color. The color study suggested that the material color has a larger effect on the perceived warmth than other material parameters. An indication of the relationships between the perceived material warmth and measurable technical material parameters offers architects insights on how to change the experience of warmth by changing specific technical parameters and thus allows to select materials in a better informed way.},

	abstract = {Wooden building systems, including cross-laminated timber elements, are becoming more common. The last few years have seen new developments and documentation of innovative types of cross-laminated timber floor assemblies. Regarding impact sound associated to walking persons, running or jumping children, such floor assemblies can be regarded as a weak part. So far, there are no reliable standardized calculation models available, for prediction of impact sound in the entire frequency range. Therefore the design is always based upon previous experiences and available measurements. This article presents the results of a number of well controlled sound insulation measurements of cross-laminated timber/massive wood floor constructions conducted in laboratories. The collection of data and results analysis highlight some basic phenomena. For instance, how structural differences related to the grouping of the constructions change the frequency distribution of the impact sound level and the single number quantities. Another significant result is the influence of the dynamic stiffness of the resilient interlayer of floating floor systems and the mass per unit area of the floors. Based on this analysis, the aim is to identify similarities and carry out simplifications. The data will be further processed and used in the development of prediction models and optimization process of cross-laminated timber floor assemblies.},

	abstract = {This work is a case study of the energy performance gap in a LEED Platinum-certified university building. Comparing the whole-building energy modeling results with the overall measured energy consumption, the building shows approximately 60\% higher energy consumption during its first year of operation than the initial model prediction. The building is heavily instrumented and a large amount of detailed data is logged, providing a unique opportunity to compare energy model prediction to actual building performance and operations. Energy performance gaps of this magnitude are commonly found and the reasons are not yet well understood. There are many potential sources for discrepancies: different usage of the building in model and reality, design, construction and commissioning deficiencies, software limitation and modeling errors and different weather in reality than in the model are the factors typically considered. To better understand the nature of the performance gap, potential sources of discrepancy between model and measurement have been eliminated in a series of steps, to evaluate their significance in the case of this particular building, starting with eliminating the most intrinsic prediction challenge to any energy model – the weather – and continuing toward increased controllability and interdependence: occupancy, lighting and equipment loads, envelope performance, mechanical systems and ventilation. The present paper shows that in the case of the CIRS building the major sources of the performance gap are that the building has been built and is operated differently from what was expected. A major component of the CIRS energy concept is heat exchange with a neighboring building; however, because of design and commissioning deficits, the heat exchange falls short of the design intent. Furthermore, a waste water treatment plant located in the building is on the building's meters and included in the measured data, but not in the energy model. The transformers' electricity consumption was not in the energy model either and they were significantly inefficient. Part of the building's unanticipated usage is large lighting and plug loads.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the applicability of emerging frameworks for evaluating the non-visual effects of light through the development of a novel area-based daylighting metric addressing goals of human circadian stimulus and entrainment in buildings. Procedures using annual, climate-based daylight modeling of eye-level light exposures are developed to analyze and map indoor environments in regard to spatial and seasonal changes in the availability of a circadian-effective daylight stimulus. Because the biological effects of light exposure are not instantaneous, a novel approach is developed to assess the duration of an effective stimulus on a daily basis, as well as the frequency an effective stimulus is present over the course of a year. Results can be used to identify and visually examine building zones where long-term occupancy may lead to disruption of the circadian system in the absence of supplemental electrical lighting capable of effective circadian stimulus. The metric and visualization techniques are implemented in a parametric, simulation-based workflow utilizing publicly available software tools. The workflow can be used to assess and differentiate the performance of various daylighting strategies during the design phases of a project, or to examine existing spaces. The applicability of the workflow is demonstrated using two example models: a portable school classroom, and a generic open-plan commercial office floor plate.},

	abstract = {In the design and operations industries, the performance gap is a common discrepancy found between predicted building energy performance and actual energy performance. The performance gap is considered to have negative impacts for the brand of ‘green’ buildings, designers and operators. A socially based analogue is proposed here: the qualitative performance gap, defined as the perceived gap between what inhabitants expect and their actual experience of the building environment. This concept is explored at a regenerative Living Lab: the Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) in Vancouver, Canada. ‘Official’ and ‘lived’ stories about the building were interpreted from sources of building information and interviews. Expectations about and forgiveness of building performance were gained from pre- and post-occupancy evaluations and interviews. The solution to the qualitative performance gap is not to eliminate it, but, in line with the concept of interactive adaptivity, to use the gap to generate new stories and new consequences for human wellbeing. The qualitative performance gap is thus conceived as positively generative, of new stories of place and identity. This work recommends crafting an ‘official story’ of social aspirations, and a communication feedback loop amongst designers, operators and building inhabitants, transparently sharing successes and failures.},

This commentary posits that realizing that potential depends on how practitioners define positive. Describing net-positive as ‘buildings that “add value” to ecological systems and generate more than they need to fulfil their own needs’ moves net-positive beyond simply a technical challenge of creating surpluses to one that requires confronting the widely different interpretations of value and value-adding held within the sustainability movement. ‘Green’ building, like the building industry, generally defines and measures a building's value in terms of human benefit. Ecological sustainability defines value in terms of benefits to the systemic capability to generate, sustain and evolve the life of a particular place. Reconciling these different definitions could transform how society conceives of and designs the built environment. Building professionals seeking to translate net-positive into practice could play a leading role in that transformation. Practice will need to embrace ecological thinking to create design, construction and ongoing management processes that stimulate dialogue about what it means for humans to play a value-adding role in the ecological systems where they are constituents.},

	abstract = {In a similar manner as plants, through the millennia animals and humans have adapted to the environmental constraints. In addition, buildings have evolved in order to respond to the environment. Bioclimatic building design is an engineering practice where the primary focus is on the building’s performance in respect to the given environmental conditions as well as the occupant’s needs. The stated goal can be accomplished through multiple approaches, either using passive solutions or active mechanical measures. However, in the light of striving for lower environmental impact and energy use of buildings, passive solutions on the level of the building envelope are preferred, as they will directly influence the operational energy performance of buildings without additional energy use, while providing higher levels of indoor comfort. Central to the notion of bioclimatic building design is the understanding that the most sustainable way to design buildings is firstly to adapt them to the environment and its occupants and in the next step to apply the state of the art technologies in order to enable appropriate functioning throughout their life cycle. Within this chapter, a concise introduction to the field of bioclimatic design will be presented.},

Prior studies have shown that occupants, who are generally satisfied with many non-thermal conditions of indoor environmental quality, are more likely to be satisfied with thermal conditions as well. This paper presents a novel approach that considers the effect of non-thermal building environmental design conditions, such as indoor air quality and noise levels, on perceived thermal comfort in open-plan offices. The methodology involves the use of Bayesian inference to relate the occupant’s thermal dissatisfaction in a building not only to thermal conditions and occupant metabolic factors (i.e., parameters of the original Fanger model), but also to measurable non-thermal metrics of indoor environmental quality. A Bayesian logistic regression approach is presented in this paper. The experimental context regards a prior indoor environmental quality measurement and evaluation study of 779 occupants of open-plan offices throughout Canada and the US. We present revised PMV-PPD curves for real-world offices that take into account both thermal and wellbeing IEQ parameters. The Bayesian inference analysis reveals that the occupant’s thermal dissatisfaction is influenced by many non-thermal IEQ conditions, such as indoor CO2 concentrations and the satisfaction with the office lighting intensity.},

	abstract = {Internationally, buildings are a major contributor to carbon emissions. Despite significant advances in the technology and construction of energy-efficient buildings, in many cases a performance gap between designed and actual performance exists. While much research has investigated the drivers of the building energy performance gap – both static and transient– there has been considerably less research into the total performance gap, defined here as performance gaps in building energy use, occupant satisfaction and Indoor Environmental Quality parameters such as thermal comfort and air quality which may impact on occupant health and wellbeing. This paper presents a meta-analysis of building performance data from buildings in the UK and China – selected due to their contrasting development environments – which illustrate the presence of and complexities of evaluating total performance gaps in both countries. The data demonstrate the need for (1) high end-use, spatial granularity and temporal resolution data for both energy and Indoor Environmental Quality, and (2) developing methodologies that allow meaningful comparisons between buildings internationally to facilitate learning from successful building design, construction methodologies and policy environments internationally. Using performance data from a UK building, a potential forward path is illustrated with the objective of developing a framework to evaluate total building performance., Practical application: While much research has examined building energy performance gaps, Indoor Environmental Quality and occupant satisfaction gaps are rarely included despite their relationship to energy. We use a meta-analysis of energy, indoor environmental quality, and occupant satisfaction data from buildings in the UK and China to illustrating the presence of and complexities of evaluating total performance gaps for buildings in the two countries, and the need for high resolution dynamic buildings data and novel methodologies for comparison between buildings across different contexts. Illustrative case studies are used to demonstrate potential future directions for evaluating ‘total’ building performance.},

Systems of precedence knowledge are in good currency at present as they are expected to enhance creativity in the early conceptual phases of the design process by interacting with given design contexts. This paper presents the view that this is a false expectation: the use of precedents is counterproductive with respect to design creativity. It is proposed that creativity can be promoted by architectural and other exemplars, but that they are most instrumental when partial and more ambiguous and manipulable than holistic exemplars such as precedents. It is claimed that open-ended computational systems of references have the potential to enhance creative designing, and they can do so regardless of the particular culture or micro-culture within which a designer operates.},

	abstract = {This thesis proposes that narrative can bring richness and depth to a architectural project, and
that there are unexplored ways that narrative can be used in the design process. I suggest that
drawing from the discipline of film production design, which is a process that is already centered
on storytelling, can offer a new working method for architecture. Using production design as a
template for the design process allows narrative to be the foundation of a design, creating a new
lens through which to see storytelling in architecture.
In production design, the script is the client – the design is completely centered on storytelling,
with each design tool being used to help tell a story. Key to designing a film’s story is the process
of world building. This process begins with the creation of mood and the development of
characters, using tools such as colour, light, scale and pattern. In architecture, narrative is often
used to frame a project or to describe how a project operates, but is not at the core of the design
process, guiding the design decisions, as is the case with production design.
Through an investigation into how the process of production design can be translated into an
architectural project, this thesis expands the conversation between narrative and architecture,
and the relationship between architecture and film. This project uses the production designer’s
narrative tools – namely world building, mood and character – to weave multiple storylines
through a site, allowing these stories to shape the design and shift the perception of the resulting
built forms. The site chosen for this exploration is Cooper’s Green Park in Halfmoon Bay, British
Columbia.
In the following design process, I use the design of five architectural interventions to support
three different stories, in a way that can be changeable from one narrative to the next. Through the architecture, this project creates moments that highlight the narratives’ story worlds – their mood and their characters.
We experience and frame our lives in stories, and architecture will always be part of those stories. I believe it is worth exploring new ways of developing architecture through narrative.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about regional and local climate change can inform climate risk assessments and adaptation decisions. However, estimates of future precipitation change at the regional and local level are deeply uncertain for many parts of the world. A novel methodology was developed that uses climate processes and expert elicitation to build narratives of future regional precipitation change. The narratives qualitatively describe physically plausible evolutions of future regional climate substantiated by climate processes. This method is applied to the Indian Summer Monsoon, focusing on the Cauvery River Basin in Karnataka, Southern India. Six climate narratives are constructed as a function of two drivers prioritised by the experts: moisture availability over the Arabian Sea and strength of the low-level westerly ﬂow. The narratives describe how future precipitation could change until the 2050s and which climate processes and anthropogenic factors could inﬂuence this evolution. Analysis using observed (Global Precipitation Climatology Centre) and re-analysis (ERA20 and Interim) data shows the experts’ judgement on key drivers ﬁts well with empirical relationships. The expert elicited drivers explain 70\% of the variance in peak monsoon precipitation (July and August) over the Western Ghats between 1979−2013 (using ERA Interim). The study shows that through expert elicitation, process-based narratives enable climate scientists to characterise and communicate elements of deep uncertainty in future precipitation change. Expert judgment techniques need be more widely applied to characterise uncertainty in regional and local climate change.},

It was predicted that persons sharing different cultures and environmental attitudes might psychologically differently evaluate a Swedish and a Japanese park despite similar thermal conditions. Consistent with this prediction, Japanese were shown to evaluate the weather as warmer and less good for out-door activity than did Swedes, although and according to the PET index participants in both cultures experienced similar comfortable thermal conditions. Japanese were also shown to evaluate the park as more pleasant and warmer place than did Swedes. However, the Japanese felt emotionally less pleasant at the site than did Swedes. An interaction between culture and environmental attitude indicated tentatively a difference in environmental attitude (urban vs. open-air person) between the two countries as regards the place-related wind sensitivity. All these findings are discussed in terms of culture and environmental attitude suggesting that thermal, emotional and perceptual assessments of a physical place may be intertwined with psychological and cultural processes, rather than fixed by general thermal indices developed in line with the physiological heat balance models.},

A historical examination of natural climate changes during the past millennium suggests that short-term changes, especially crucial changes, trigger a significant response in and by society. Shortterm changes correspond to the 'time horizon of everyday life', that is, to a time scale from days and weeks to a few years. The currently anticipated anthropogenic climate changes, however, are expected to occur on a longer time scale. They require a response by society not on the basis of primary experience but on the basis of scientifically constructed scenarios and the ways in which such information is represented in the modern media, for example. Socio-economic impact research relies on concepts that are based on the premise of perfectly informed actors for the development of optim.al adaptation strategies. In contrast to such a conception, we develop the concept of a 'social construct of climate' as decisive for the public perception of scientific knowledge about climate and for public policy on climate change. The concept is illustrated using a number of examples.},

	abstract = {Flooding as an adverse effect of climate change is becoming more pronounced each day, making communities vulnerable to its threats. There is an urgent need for resilience planning and well-coordinated, science-based design intervention. There is significant information on coastal flooding as evident from recent resilience competitions. The goal of this paper is to learn from this information what can be done to address the lack of coordination and communication related to flooding in Pennsylvania’s riverine communities. Only 186 out of more than 2500 communities are safe from high water, making flooding the most frequent and damaging disaster in Pennsylvania according to PEMA (Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency). A recent survey carried out by DVPRC shows that riverine flooding represents risks in the form of flooding of private properties and roadways and stress on aging water infrastructure like sewer lines and dikes. While the US government has led initiatives to plan for resilience, there is a lack of expertise, coordination and communication to guide the process. Reports on the winning projects in recent competitions are a source to address current short-fallings. By taking a step forward and leading the path towards resilience planning, they have provided resources that can be translated to inform other regions and risks. This research undergoes a case-study review of a couple of resilience competitions to learn about their resilience design process. Using this knowledge, it aims to close the gap in knowledge and address limitations of a traditional planning process across Pennsylvania’s riverine communities. Findings focus on effective community-engagement strategies, need for and ways to adopt multi- disciplinary collaboration, institutional changes required to facilitate resilience planning and the overall resilience design process. The paper concludes that traditional planning approaches by local government bodies could largely benefit from adopting or locally adapting the proposed resilient strategies.},

	abstract = {General circulation models (GCMs) are essential for projecting future climate; however, despite the rapid advances in their ability to simulate the climate system at increasing spatial resolution, GCMs cannot capture the local and regional weather dynamics necessary for climate impacts assessments. Temperature and precipitation, for which dense observational records are available, can be bias corrected and downscaled, but many climate impacts models require a larger set of variables such as relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation. To address this need, we develop and demonstrate an analog-based approach, which we call a ‘‘weather estimator.’’ The weather estimator employs a highly generalizable structure, utilizing temperature and precipitation from previously downscaled GCMs to select analogs from a reanalysis product, resulting in a complete daily gridded dataset. The resulting dataset, constructed from the selected analogs, contains weather variables needed for impacts modeling that are physically, spatially, and temporally consistent. This approach relies on the weather variables’ correlation with temperature and precipitation, and our correlation analysis indicates that the weather estimator should best estimate evaporation, relative humidity, and cloud cover and do less well in estimating pressure and wind speed and direction. In addition, while the weather estimator has several user-deﬁned parameters, a sensitivity analysis shows that the method is robust to small variations in important model parameters. The weather estimator recreates the historical distributions of relative humidity, pressure, evaporation, shortwave radiation, cloud cover, and wind speed well and outperforms a multiple linear regression estimator across all predictands.},

In doing so it goes a significant step beyond past population scenarios in the IPCC context which considered only total population size. By differentiating the human population not only by age and sex—as is conventionally done in demographic projections—but also by different levels of educational attainment the most fundamental aspects of human development and social change are being explicitly addressed through modeling the changing composition of populations by these three important individual characteristics. The scenarios have been defined in a collaborative effort of the international Integrated Assessment Modeling community with the medium scenario following that of a major new effort by the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA, OEAW, WU) involving over 550 experts from around the world. As a result, in terms of total world population size the trajectories resulting from the five SSPs stay very close to each other until around 2030 and by the middle of the century already a visible differentiation appears with the range between the highest (SSP3) and the lowest (SSP1) trajectories spanning 1.5 billion. The range opens up much more with the SSP3 reaching 12.6 billion in 2100 and SSP1 falling to 6.9 billion which is lower than today's world population.},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

	abstract = {Global GDP projections for the 21st century are needed for the exploration of long-term global environmental problems, in particular climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions as well as climate change mitigation and adaption capacities strongly depend on growth of per capita income. However, long-term economic projections are highly uncertain. This paper provides five new long-term economic scenarios as part of the newly developed shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) which represent a set of widely diverging narratives. A method of GDP scenario building is presented that is based on assumptions about technological progress, and human and physical capital formation as major drivers of long-term GDP per capita growth. The impact of these drivers differs significantly between different shared socio-economic pathways and is traced back to the underlying narratives and the associated population and education scenarios. In a highly fragmented world, technological and knowledge spillovers are low. Hence, the growth impact of technological progress and human capital is comparatively low, and per capita income diverges between world regions. These factors play a much larger role in globalization scenarios, leading to higher economic growth and stronger convergence between world regions. At the global average, per capita GDP is projected to grow annually in a range between 1.0\% (SSP3) and 2.8\% (SSP5) from 2010 to 2100. While this covers a large portion of variety in future global economic growth projections, plausible lower and higher growth projections may still be conceivable. The GDP projections are put into the context of historic patterns of economic growth (stylized facts), and their sensitivity to key assumptions is explored.},

	abstract = {Long-term economic scenarios (up to 2100) are needed as a basis to explore possible different futures for major environmental challenges, including climate change. Given the high level of uncertainty involved, such scenarios would need to span a wide range of possible growth trajectories. The recently developed storylines of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) provide a basis for making such projections. This paper describes a consistent methodology to derive (per capita) GDP trend pathways on a country basis. The methodology is based on a convergence process and places emphasis on the key drivers of economic growth in the long run: population, total factor productivity, physical capital, employment and human capital, and energy and fossil fuel resources (specifically oil and gas). The paper uses this methodology to derive country-level economic growth projections for 184 countries. The paper also investigates the influence of short-term growth rate estimates on the long-term income levels in various countries. It does so by comparing long-term projections based on short-term forecasts from 2011 with the projections based on forecasts from 2013. This highlights the effects of the recent economic crisis and uncertainty in short term developments on longer term growth trends. The projections are subject to large uncertainties, particularly for the later decades, and disregard a wide range of country-specific drivers of economic growth that are outside the narrow economic framework, such as external shocks, governance barriers and feedbacks from environmental damage. Hence, they should be interpreted with sufficient care and not be treated as predictions.},

	abstract = {The new scenario process for climate change research includes the creation of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) describing alternative societal development trends over the coming decades. Urbanization is a key aspect of development that is relevant to studies of mitigation, adaptation, and impacts. Incorporating urbanization into the SSPs requires a consistent set of global urbanization projections that cover long time horizons and span a full range of uncertainty. Existing urbanization projections do not meet these needs, in particular providing only a single scenario over the next few decades, a period during which urbanization is likely to be highly dynamic in many countries. We present here a new, long-term, global set of urbanization projections at country level that cover a plausible range of uncertainty. We create SSP-specific projections by choosing urbanization outcomes consistent with each SSP narrative. Results show that the world continues to urbanize in each of the SSPs but outcomes differ widely across them, with urbanization reaching 60\%, 79\%, and 92\% by the end of century in SSP3, SSP2, and SSP1/SSP4/SSP5, respectively. The degree of convergence in urbanization across countries also differs substantially, with largely convergent outcomes by the end of the century in SSP1 and SSP5 and persistent diversity in SSP3. This set of global, country-specific projections produces urbanization pathways that are typical of regions in different stages of urbanization and development levels, and can be extended to further elaborate assumptions about the styles of urban growth and spatial distributions of urban people and land cover occurring in each SSP.},

The results are based on the implementation using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model and are compared with a) other IMAGE implementations of the SSPs (SSP2 and SSP3) and b) the SSP1 implementation of other integrated assessment models. The results show that a combination of resource efficiency, preferences for sustainable production methods and investment in human development could lead to a strong transition towards a more renewable energy supply, less land use and lower anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2100 than in 2010, even in the absence of explicit climate policies. At the same time, climate policy would still be needed to reduce emissions further, in order to reduce the projected increase of global mean temperature from 3°C (SSP1 reference scenario) to 2 or 1.5°C (in line with current policy targets). The SSP1 storyline could be a basis for further discussions on how climate policy can be combined with achieving other societal goals.},

A seven-point list of requirements for weather files is introduced and the state-of-the-art compared to this via a mapping exercise. It is found that there are various issues with all current and suggested approaches, but the two areas most requiring attention are the production of weather files for the urban landscape and files specifically designed to test buildings against the criteria of morbidity, mortality and building services system failure.},

As a result, housing models with a higher exchange value rather than a higher use value were favored in the environmental decision-making process.

	abstract = {Socio-economic scenarios constitute an important tool for exploring the long-term consequences of anthropogenic climate change and available response options. A more consistent use of socio-economic scenarios that would allow an integrated perspective on mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts remains a major challenge. We assert that the identification of a set of global narratives and socio-economic pathways offering scalability to different regional contexts, a reasonable coverage of key socio-economic dimensions and relevant futures, and a sophisticated approach to separating climate policy from counter-factual “no policy” scenarios would be an important step toward meeting this challenge. To this end, we introduce the concept of “shared socio-economic (reference) pathways”. Sufficient coverage of the relevant socio-economic dimensions may be achieved by locating the pathways along the dimensions of challenges to mitigation and to adaptation. The pathways should be specified in an iterative manner and with close collaboration between integrated assessment modelers and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers to assure coverage of key dimensions, sufficient scalability and widespread adoption. They can be used not only as inputs to analyses, but also to collect the results of different climate change analyses in a matrix defined by two dimensions: climate exposure as characterized by a radiative forcing or temperature level and socio-economic development as classified by the pathways. For some applications, socio-economic pathways may have to be augmented by “shared climate policy assumptions” capturing global components of climate policies that some studies may require as inputs. We conclude that the development of shared socio-economic (reference) pathways, and integrated socio-economic scenarios more broadly, is a useful focal point for collaborative efforts between integrated assessment and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers.},

	abstract = {The exploration of alternative socioeconomic futures is an important aspect of understanding the potential consequences of climate change. While socioeconomic scenarios are common and, at times essential, tools for the impacts, adaptation and vulnerability and integrated assessment modeling research communities, their approaches to scenario development have historically been quite distinct. However, increasing convergence of impacts, adaptation and vulnerability and integrated assessment modeling research in terms of scales of analysis suggests there may be value in the development of a common framework for socioeconomic scenarios. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways represents an opportunity for the development of such a common framework. However, the scales at which these global storylines have been developed are largely incommensurate with the sub-national scales at which impacts, adaptation and vulnerability and, increasingly, integrated assessment modeling studies are conducted. The objective of this study was to develop sub-national and sectoral extensions of the global SSP storylines in order to identify future socioeconomic challenges for adaptation for the U.S. Southeast. A set of nested qualitative socioeconomic storyline elements, integrated storylines, and accompanying quantitative indicators were developed through an application of the Factor–Actor–Sector framework. In addition to revealing challenges and opportunities associated with the use of the SSPs as a basis for more refined scenario development, this study generated sub-national storyline elements and storylines that can subsequently be used to explore the implications of alternative sub-national socioeconomic futures for the assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, studies have predicted an increase in the overall air temperature due to climate change. Today's society is already sensing this change, which could have a negative impact on the environment and efforts are being made to seek all possible measures to curb it. One of the consequences of this temperature rise would be its effect on indoor comfort within buildings, which may cause higher energy consumption and operational costs, while reducing the useful lifetime of air-conditioning equipment. In this paper, an existing zero energy building (ZEB) is being studied to understand the possible effects of climate change on its zero energy status. The building is also a zero carbon building because all of its generated energies come from renewable sources (biomass, geothermal and solar photovoltaic systems). The building LUCIA has the highest innovative technologies in energy systems, design and construction elements and is currently considered as one of the top three buildings with the highest LEED certification in the world. According to current European regulations, buildings will tend to become self-sufficient in terms of energy after 2020, and therefore this study will help us to understand the changes in energy consumption within a long-term timeframe, for such zero-energy buildings. With the aid of the Design Builder version 5 software and its EnergyPlus building energy engine, a building model is simulated and energy consumption is analyzed for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080 timeframe. The climatic conditions pertain to the city of Valladolid, Spain, which has a continental climate, while the expected changes in climatic conditions have been produced through the methodology developed by the University of Southampton, called CCworldweathergen. Results have shown that the cooling demand would significantly increase for the years 2050 and 2080, while space heating would drop. This will increase the overall demand for burning more biofuels to cover the added demand in absorption cooling systems. Moreover, the previously excess generated electricity of the building by photovoltaics would then be totally consumed within the building due to increased demand. This implies that the installed systems will operate for longer hours, which will increase maintenance and replacement costs. As a result of this study, it becomes possible to quantify the expected changes in energy consumption and prepare preventive actions to anticipate this change, while improving the management and control of both the energy systems and the building.},

Yet, individuals, communities and sectors experience a broad array of multi-scalar and multi-temporal, social, political, economic and environmental changes to which they are vulnerable and must adapt. While extensive theoretical—and increasingly empirical—work suggests the need to explore multiple exposures, a clear conceptual framework which would facilitate analysis of vulnerability and adaptation to multiple interacting socioeconomic and biophysical changes is lacking. This review and synthesis paper aims to fill this gap through presenting a conceptual framework for integrating multiple exposures into vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning. To support applications of the framework and facilitate assessments and comparative analyses of community vulnerability, we develop a comprehensive typology of drivers and exposures experienced by coastal communities. Our results reveal essential elements of a pragmatic approach for local-scale vulnerability analysis and for planning appropriate adaptations within the context of multiple interacting exposures. We also identify methodologies for characterizing exposures and impacts, exploring interactions and identifying and prioritizing responses. This review focuses on coastal communities; however, we believe the framework, typology and approach will be useful for understanding vulnerability and planning adaptation to multiple exposures in various social-ecological contexts.},

As temperatures rise and concerns mount that we have passed the tipping point, local media play a potentially critical role in communicating how climate change exacerbates their impact. Based on a review of extant literature on this topic, and a small pilot email survey, this article argues that scientists could be more active in increasing local salience of climate change by building trusted relationships with local media. Coverage of science in the media could benefit from closer engagement with local scientists as environmental stories often get more coverage in local media (compared to national media) which constitute an important source of knowledge on climate change. This would enable constructive discussions between local media and scientists, better translation of science to publics, increased awareness and interest of science production locally, and ultimately creating a trusted intermediary in the science-public interface.},

Annual energy consumption of a medium-size office building was predicted by building energy simulation software—EnergyPlus using TMY3 weather data and future climate data. In this study, we have used two sets of further climate data with different climate models including (1) Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3), and (2) NCAR Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5). A morphing method was applied to downscale the monthly weather forecast to hourly forecast for use in building energy simulation for the two General Circulation Models (GCMs): HadCM3 and CESM1. Using the generated future weather files, HVAC operation related mitigation measures including adjustment of thermostat setpoints, reduced HVAC operation hours, reduced VAV box minimum flow setting, and mixed-mode ventilation were simulated to compare with ASHRAE Standard 90.1 baseline simulated using TMY3 weather data. Simulation results on predicted whole building, heating and cooling energy consumptions were examined.

	abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the impact of future climate on building systems, taking account of a strict building standard. A building is modelled in TRNSYS regarding a sustainable heating and cooling energy production by solar heating and radiative cooling in combination with water storage tanks. Sensitivity analyses (Morris Method) are performed for the technical building configurations for the years 2030, 2050 and 2100 (REMO climate model). They are compared and evaluated with the current reference climate (TRY) of 2017. The objective is to show which components have a significant influence on the energy consumption of buildings. Furthermore, due to the climate change sustainable building technologies are necessary. This paper demonstrates how the influence of the climate can be counteracted from the perspective of building services. Global warming requires a rethink of the interaction between building design, building technologies and climate. In this point building services engineering offers the most flexibility. By performing parameter studies, early knowledge about the building and its required technology can be gained. The target value of this study is the indoor air temperature as a function of the outdoor temperature. The objective function corresponds to specifications according to the European standard EN 15251. Following the parameter studies, optimization processes are carried out.},

	abstract = {Facility managers and occupants can have a significant influence on the energy consumed in buildings through their operation of various building systems. Acknowledging this energy-saving potential, researchers have turned to building energy modeling to quantify the impact of human actions and operation patterns on building performance and propose energy conservation strategies. However, a review of the current literature reveals consistent shortcomings related to the: (1) implementation and validation of the simulated strategies; (2) availability of granular data on occupants’ characteristics and their working conditions; (3) consideration of the building's urban context (e.g., shading effects from neighboring buildings); and (4) implications for low-energy buildings subjected to extreme climate conditions. This paper presents an integrated data collection, energy modeling, and analysis framework to evaluate and apply operation-focused energy saving strategies in commercial buildings. The framework is supported by contextual data covering the building's design, occupants, and urban context. It is validated through a case study on a low-energy design building in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Energy savings of 24.4\% are observed in the studied building following the implementation of simple operation strategies that do not require any capital investment nor affect the comfort and wellbeing of building occupants.},

	abstract = {Passive Houses are buildings which provide comfortable indoor conditions at an extremely low heating and cooling load. The peak daily average heating and cooling loads are typically below 10W/m2 and annual useful energy demands are below 15kWh/(m2a). The Passive House standard was originally developed in Germany. In this paper we show by hygro-thermal dynamic simulation that it is possible to realize residential Passive Houses in all of the world's relevant climate zones, represented here by Yekaterinburg, Tokyo, Shanghai, Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore. The window quality, insulation levels, and mechanical services all depend on the climate as well as on the building's shape and orientation. The resulting annual energy demand for space conditioning of the Passive Houses is 75 to 95\% lower than that of a traditionally insulated building of the same geometry. In humid climates like Shanghai or Singapore, special attention must be paid to humidity aspects. In climates which are hot and humid all year long, the total useful energy demand for sensible and latent cooling may exceed 70kWh/(m2a) even in a Passive House. Finally, it is shown that the architectural quality is not compromised by the Passive House requirements.},

This is followed by a review of papers published in the last 10 years that examine the various sub-areas of research related to human thermal comfort. Some remarkable works about both the Fanger's and adaptive thermal comfort models are also discussed. This review does not contain simulation works and/or experimental studies without subjective results of people. As a result of the literature review, 466 articles were classified and grouped to form the body of this article. The article examines standards, indoor experiments in controlled environments (climate chamber) and semi-controlled environments, indoor field studies in educational, office, residential and other building types, productivity, human physiological models, outdoor and semi-outdoor field studies. Several research topics are also addressed involving naturally ventilated, air-conditioned and mixed-mode buildings, personalized conditioning systems and the influence of personal (age, weight, gender, thermal history) and environmental (controls, layout, air movement, humidity, among others) variables on thermal comfort.},

	abstract = {Over the past half century, a discourse emphasizing environmental constraints and limits has both informed and provided many valuable ways of responding to complex environmental problems and has strongly shaped green building practices and associated environmental assessment methods. This paper delineates the concept of ‘regenerative sustainability’ – a net-positive approach to sustainability that is rooted in the notion of ‘procedural sustainability’ and a particular stream of constructivist social theory. The paper contrasts this to the concept of ‘regenerative development and design’ which, although having many commonalities, is based on different philosophical underpinnings. Since the origins of regenerative sustainability and regenerative design lie primarily in the social and ecological domains respectively, understanding their relationship is of importance in formulating approaches for the successful co-evolution of human and natural systems. The paper describes this relationship between regenerative sustainability and regenerative design, including a discussion of some of the key points of convergence and divergence between them, and concludes with an exploration of the practical implications of the regenerative sustainability concept.},

The policy and regulatory context for the building industry is examined in relation to the policy context for solutions and recommendations that will work for all parties. Based on this analysis, two substantive recommendations are made for improved policy design. Firstly, a decoupling of policy objectives and policy mechanisms is needed so that the policy-taking stakeholders (in design, development and construction) can reduce energy use in buildings more effectively. Secondly, policy-taking stakeholders need an explicit and diverse system in order to advocate for policy objectives. The major aspect of this work is the development of a new conceptual framework that ties together these recommendations into a continuous process of policy-making and policy-taking. This framework demonstrates an idealized system that operates simultaneously top down and bottom up, and the development of policy objectives is influenced by stakeholders of all kinds to further the goals of an energy-efficient, low-carbon built environment.},

	abstract = {To what extent can the urgency of climate change and an evolving concept of agency (at the individual and social levels of building users) create a new context for rethinking the notion of comfort? A new, emerging notion of comfort is explored that embraces engagement with new conditions, new experiences, and new types of interactions between inhabitants and building systems and unfamiliar technologies. The emphasis is on communication and dialogue as two dynamic and adaptive processes necessary to achieve optimal building performance while valuing and responding to inhabitant knowledge and agency, and enhancing indoor environmental quality from the standpoint of the inhabitants. A primary conclusion is that the goal of shifting into a lower carbon society has created a new context for comfort, from its conventional emphasis as automated, uniform and predictable, to a broader notion that takes into consideration dynamic, integrated, and participatory aspects. The key dimensions of this emergent broader view of comfort are examined and the relationships between them revealed. Dans quelle mesure l'urgence du changement climatique et un concept évolutif d'agence (au niveau individuel et social des utilisateurs de bâtiments) créent-t-ils un nouveau contexte où revoir la notion de confort? L'auteur explore une nouvelle notion de confort qui englobe l'engagement avec de nouvelles conditions, de nouvelles expériences et de nouveaux types d'interactions entre les habitants, les systèmes de construction et des technologies nouvelles. L'accent est mis sur la communication et le dialogue comme étant deux processus dynamiques et adaptatifs nécessaire pour obtenir des performances de construction optimales tout en donnant sa valeur et en répondant à la connaissance des habitants et à l'agence et en améliorant la qualité de l'environnement intérieur du point de vue des habitants. Selon une conclusion majeure, l'objectif visé qui est de passer à une société émettant moins de carbone a donné naissance à un nouveau contexte de confort, en passant de l'accent classique sur l'automatisation, l'uniformité et la prévisibilité à une notion plus large qui prend en considération des aspects dynamiques, intégrés et participatifs. L'auteur analyse les dimensions principales de cette idée émergente et élargie de confort ainsi que les relations entre elles.

One of the main paradigm shift was the fundamental conceptual reorientation that has taken place in thermal comfort thinking over the last 20 years; a shift away from the physically based determinism of Fanger's comfort model toward the mainstream and acceptance of the adaptive comfort model. Another noticeable shift has been from the undesirable toward the desirable qualities of air movement. Additionally, sophisticated models covering the physics and physiology of the human body were developed, driven by the continuous challenge to model thermal comfort at the same anatomical resolution and to combine these localized signals into a coherent, global thermal perception. Finally, the demand for ever increasing building energy efficiency is pushing technological innovation in the way we deliver comfortable indoor environments.

However, the scales at which these global storylines have been developed are largely incommensurate with the sub-national scales at which impacts, adaptation and vulnerability and, increasingly, integrated assessment modeling studies are conducted. The objective of this study was to develop sub-national and sectoral extensions of the global SSP storylines in order to identify future socioeconomic challenges for adaptation for the U.S. Southeast. A set of nested qualitative socioeconomic storyline elements, integrated storylines, and accompanying quantitative indicators were developed through an application of the Factor–Actor–Sector framework. In addition to revealing challenges and opportunities associated with the use of the SSPs as a basis for more refined scenario development, this study generated sub-national storyline elements and storylines that can subsequently be used to explore the implications of alternative sub-national socioeconomic futures for the assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation.},

	abstract = {Socio-economic scenarios enable us to understand the extent to which global-, national- and local-scale societal developments can influence the nature and severity of climate change risks and response options. Shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) enable a systematic exploration of the challenges to adaptation and mitigation that alternative futures entail. However, SSPs are primarily defined for the global scale. If countries are to test their adaptation and mitigation options for robustness across plausible future socio-economic conditions, then SSPs require country-relevant detail to understand climate change risks at the national and local scales. New Zealand is used to illustrate how nationally relevant socio-economic scenarios, nested within SSPs can be developed to inform national- and local-scale studies of climate change impacts and their implications. Shared policy assumptions were developed, involving a mix of climate-specific and non-climate-specific policies, to demonstrate how international links and global-scale developments are critical locally—local choices may accelerate, reduce or even negate the impact of global trends for extended periods. The typology was then ‘tested’ by applying it in a local context. The research challenges observed in developing credible, salient and legitimate national-scale socio-economic scenarios include issues in developing scenarios across a multidisciplinary team. Finally, recommendations for adapting shared climate policy assumptions to produce national and local scenarios, and for assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of climate change adaptation options are presented. These include the need for: guidelines to embed national scenarios in global frameworks; a limit the number of plausible futures; inter-operability of models; an ability to work towards effective multi-disciplinary teams and integrative research; and the opportunity to involve participatory processes where feasible.},

Critical Regionalist alternatives are more than a postmodern mix of ethno styles but integrate conceptual qualities like local light, perspective, and tectonic quality into a modern architectural framework. In order to "critically" root architectural works in their corresponding traditions, Critical Regionalists base their conceptual stances on those philosophers that have produced a critical consciousness in European culture like Kant, Ranke, Niebuhr, Humboldt, and others. It must appear as surprising that philosophy, the field from which architectural Critical Regionalism extracted its theoretical foundations, has never developed its own Critical Regionalist tradition. The present article attempts to formulate the relationship between regionalism and philosophy in a different fashion: is it possible and useful to retrospectively use the philosophical insights gained by architectural Critical Regionalism for a definition of the practice of regionalism in contemporary philosophy?},

	abstract = {This study examines the relationship between the design philosophies and practices of three Japanese case study subjects-the commercial space designer Takashi Sugimoto, the architects Kengo Kuma and Hiroshi Sambuichi-and the body of architectural theory knows as "Critical Regionalism" as well as some related theoretical work (including bioclimatic design theory), in both in Japan and in the West. The thesis examines the extent to which their work integrates concerns associated with local values and traditions (and often with topographical particularities) into strategies for practice in the international marketplace. Based on interviews, site visits, and analyses of selected writings and design works, the author enunciates key concepts, techniques, and qualities in each designer's oeuvre, focusing on "regionalist" elements and on each designer's response to the exigencies of design practice in the era of globalization. The study also considers recent work by design historians on the impact of globalization on scholarship and practice, insights from which are applied to the case studies alongside those derived from an examination of the debate in twentieth century architectural theory and practice over the place of "regional" and "universal" elements. Attention is paid to the rise and proliferation of the International Style as the architectural manifestation of (universal) Modernism and the responses to this by mid-twentieth century American regionalists. In addition, practitioners of Postmodernism in Japan and the West are examined alongside the central concern with "Critical Regionalism" as articulated in the early 1980s by Liane LeFaivre, Alexander Tzonis, and Kenneth Frampton. The study concludes that critical regionalist theory offered a perspective that combines the functional efficiency of Modernism with concern for the distinctiveness of particular sites. However one of the reasons this theory did not translate into a sustained practice movement was that available technologies were insufficient at the time to support the full vision of practitioners in this regard. While the study does not argue that any single approach can satisfy all design clients and stakeholders, it further concludes that regionalist ideals, realized through today's technology, can provide a new paradigm for architectural and space design practices that preserve a high degree of local cultural specificity while resisting homogenization and responding effectively to rising concerns regarding environmental sustainability—at least when applied as adroitly as in the work of Sugimoto, Kuma, and Sambuichi.},

	abstract = {Univariate or multivariate ordinal responses are often assumed to arise from a latent continuous parametric distribution, with covariate effects that enter linearly. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach for univariate and multivariate ordinal regression, which is based on mixture modeling for the joint distribution of latent responses and covariates. The modeling framework enables highly flexible inference for ordinal regression relationships, avoiding assumptions of linearity or additivity in the covariate effects. In standard parametric ordinal regression models, computational challenges arise from identifiability constraints and estimation of parameters requiring nonstandard inferential techniques. A key feature of the nonparametric model is that it achieves inferential flexibility, while avoiding these difficulties. In particular, we establish full support of the nonparametric mixture model under fixed cut-off points that relate through discretization the latent continuous responses with the ordinal responses. The practical utility of the modeling approach is illustrated through application to two datasets from econometrics, an example involving regression relationships for ozone concentration, and a multirater agreement problem. Supplementary materials with technical details on theoretical results and on computation are available online.},

These two strategies are evaluated and constrasted in terms of their usefulness in answering basic research questions that arise in multivariate analysis. One overriding conclusion is that, contrary to the claims of its proponents, the ordinal strategy is no better than the parametric strategy at meeting some of the basic requirements of multivariate analysis. It is argued that parametric strategy, when accompanied by careful evaluation of the validity of the implict quantification of ordinal variables, is more amenable to one of the goals of scientific research: successive approximation and refinement.},

Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to describe the realized climate space for British Columbia's ecosystems and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species.

Periods of soil moisture deficits during the month of June were associated with the onset western hemlock looper outbreaks in the study area, as were warmer and drier conditions during the growing season two years prior to the first year of visible defoliation. Models of climate change predict that future summers in the Pacific Northwest will be warmer and potentially drier than present, and although other factors besides climate influence western hemlock looper population dynamics, the combined effects of more frequent droughts, changes in forest cover, and expanded range of western hemlock due to climate change may result in increased frequency, size and severity of outbreaks in the future.},

These scenarios form the low end of the scenario literature in terms of emissions and radiative forcing. They often show negative emissions from energy use in the second half of the 21st century. The RCP2.6 scenario is shown to be technically feasible in the IMAGE integrated assessment modeling framework from a medium emission baseline scenario, assuming full participation of all countries. Cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases from 2010 to 2100 need to be reduced by 70\% compared to a baseline scenario, requiring substantial changes in energy use and emissions of non-CO2 gases. These measures (specifically the use of bio-energy and reforestation measures) also have clear consequences for global land use. Based on the RCP2.6 scenario, recommendations for further research on low emission scenarios have been formulated. These include the response of the climate system to a radiative forcing peak, the ability of society to achieve the required emission reduction rates given political and social inertia and the possibilities to further reduce emissions of non-CO2 gases.},

Many real-world applications present this labelling structure and that has increased the number of methods and algorithms developed over the last years in this field. Although ordinal regression can be faced using standard nominal classification techniques, there are several algorithms which can specifically benefit from the ordering information. Therefore, this paper is aimed at reviewing the state of the art on these techniques and proposing a taxonomy based on how the models are constructed to take the order into account. Furthermore, a thorough experimental study is proposed to check if the use of the order information improves the performance of the models obtained, considering some of the approaches within the taxonomy. The results confirm that ordering information benefits ordinal models improving their accuracy and the closeness of the predictions to actual targets in the ordinal scale.},

	abstract = {Many of the ordinal regression models that have been proposed in the literature can be seen as methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the zero-one, absolute, or squared loss functions. A key property that allows to study the statistical implications of such approximations is that of Fisher consistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss functions and implies that in the population setting, i.e., if the probability distribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the surrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will characterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss functions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that, for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal regression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex margin-based surrogates in binary classiﬁcation. We also derive excess risk bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk bounds for binary classiﬁcation. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel surrogate of the squared error loss. We compare this novel surrogate with competing approaches on 9 diﬀerent datasets. Our method shows to be highly competitive in practice, outperforming the least squares loss on 7 out of 9 datasets.},

	abstract = {Green-building certification systems aim at improving the design and operation of buildings. However, few detailed studies have investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality (IEQ). This research builds on previous work to address this. Based on the analysis of a subset of the Center for the Built Environment Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality survey database featuring 11,243 responses from 93 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-rated office buildings, this study explores the relationships between the points earned in the IEQ category and the satisfaction expressed by occupants with the qualities of their indoor environment. It was found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantively increase satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor, while the rating level, and the product and version under which certification had been awarded, did not affect workplace satisfaction. There could be several reasons for this, some of which are outside the control of designers and beyond the scope of rating systems based primarily on design intent. The challenges and priorities facing building professionals, researchers and green building certification systems are discussed for the creation of more comfortable, higher performing and healthier green-rated buildings.},

We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach for univariate and multivariate ordinal regression, which is based on mixture modeling for the joint distribution of latent responses and covariates. The modeling framework enables highly flexible inference for ordinal regression relationships, avoiding assumptions of linearity or additivity in the covariate effects. In standard parametric ordinal regression models, computational challenges arise from identifiability constraints and estimation of parameters requiring nonstandard inferential techniques. A key feature of the nonparametric model is that it achieves inferential flexibility, while avoiding these difficulties. In particular, we establish full support of the nonparametric mixture model under fixed cut-off points that relate through discretization the latent continuous responses with the ordinal responses. The practical utility of the modeling approach is illustrated through application to two datasets from econometrics, an example involving regression relationships for ozone concentration, and a multirater agreement problem.

	abstract = {Long-term scenarios play an important role in research on global environmental change. The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

Thus, various climates can be found, from the polar tundra and cold climate in the Alps and northern European regions, to hot-arid climate in southern parts of Spain. This level of climate diversity makes the European territory interesting for the analysis from the bioclimatic building design perspective. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to assess the bioclimatic potential of selected European locations. The calculation of bioclimatic potential was done by acquiring the typical meteorological year (TMY) data comprised of climate characteristics, such as air temperature, air relative humidity and received solar irradiance, which was later processed by BcChart tool. In order to make bioclimatic potential maps of Europe, the points with uniform point sampling were generated. Furthermore, several additional locations of great interest were selected based on population density. The bioclimatic potential was used to define the prevailing passive building design strategies and measures at the analysed locations. At the same time, the in-depth analysis was conducted using the geospatial data and GIS tools, where the bioclimatic potential results at the selected locations were additionally analysed in relation to Köppen-Geiger climate types. The resulting bioclimatic potential maps can be used as a relevant onset for the policy makers in order to improve regional development strategies for building design.},

This paper presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of normative energy models. Based on CEN-ISO standards, normative energy models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved representation of the actual buildings and quantification of uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option.},

Potential decisions can range from the installation of demand-side measures to the replacement of energy supply systems and combinations therewithin. The classical decision theories of Wald, Savage, and Hurwicz are used to perform non-probabilistic optimisation under both technical and economic uncertainty. Such techniques, though simple in their handling of uncertainty, may elucidate robust decisions when the use of more intensive, probabilistic assessments of uncertainty is either infeasible or impractical.},

	abstract = {Weather files provide hourly times series of weather variables for a typical year based on historical observations, and are widely used for modeling energy use and human comfort in the built environment. However, since they are based on historical data, they are increasingly inaccurate tools for estimating the future performance of buildings and communities, especially those with lifetimes exceeding 30 years. A “morphing” technique [1] has been used to transform historical time series based on projected changes in the monthly averages of several climatic variables. Since future values of these variables are uncertain, especially at local scales, changes in the monthly mean value of each of the variables, or offsets, have been calculated for an ensemble of climate projections generated by models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). These models were run for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment (AR5). The offsets were calculated for several future time periods during the 21st century for both the 4.5 and 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). For each combination of time period and RCP, a cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) of the offset in mean monthly temperature was constructed based on the percentile rankings of the projections in the ensemble. The association between the mean monthly temperature and the other variables for each model is maintained, providing a consistent and physically plausible set of inputs to the morphing algorithm for each point on the CFD. The Weather File Module of the WeatherShift™ tool provides an intuitive user interface that allows the user to select a location, emissions scenario, future time period and point on the CFD to obtain a projected weather file reflecting a plausible future climate.},

“Since antiquity, man has reacted to his environment, using his faculties to develop techniques and technologies, in such a psychological balance with nature that humanity historically lived attuned to the environment” (Fathy 1986)1
As concerns for the future of our planet steadily increase pertaining to the depletion of resources, energy consumption, and globalization, alternative solutions can improve the impact we have on our environment, as well as provide the ideal environment for us. The provision of housing for the rapidly growing population continually keeps architects and developers seeking ways to provide the most economically friendly, site specific design that can also be sustainable. Design solutions do not have to be costly or incorporate complicated modern technology to be sustainable and energy efficient. However, technological advancements continue to dictate the relationship between man and comfort. Can a blended principle of past solutions and modern technologies work together to improve the effects of climate on human environment?
This dissertation is meant to gather vernacular lessons to develop a valid framework, in order to create environmentally and culturally sustainable residential prototypes. Through a global analysis, a framework is extrapolated from existing vernacular case studies and modeled to test their relationships and possible improvements to prove their validity today within a single site, the Chihuahua Desert in North America.

	abstract = {This essay asks, and develops a possible answer to, the question: ‘What is the future of climate when the possibility of “a climate” is no longer?’ I argue that the idea of climate only makes sense when there is a degree of stability in some set of conditions, whether these be atmospheric, economic, political or moral. When everything is changing and no stable condition is possible -- the situation to which the idea of the Anthropocene seeks to give expression -- then the cultural value of climate as a stabilising idea is diminished. People in the future will therefore have to learn to live without the idea of climate. At least learn to live without climate as an idea that brings order and stability to relationships between weather and human culture. Given that all cultures are weathered and that weather is increasingly being cultivated by people, new categories and practices of orientation and guidance than the old re-assuring idea of ‘climate’ will be needed in the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {During Holocene advances of the Bear River Glacier, in northwestern British Columbia, ice pushed against a bedrock slope on the north side of Bear River Pass as it was being diverted eastward and westward along the pass. The result is a series of till sheets plastered against the rock slope and separated by wood mats. This sequence of tills provides an unusually detailed record of early-Neoglacial history and shows that Neoglacial expansion in the northern Coast Mountains began earlier than previously known. Moraines show the extent of ‘Little Ice Age’ expansion, and documents related to the long mining history of the area provide records of post-LIA recession. The oldest deposits in the area are a small lateral moraine outside of a prominent LIA moraine, and a till in the pass older than c. 3500 14C yr BP. The small moraine is undated; it may be equivalent to the latest-Pleistocene Crowfoot Advance which produced similar moraines in the southern Coast Mountains and eastern Cordillera. Wood mats in the pass show that Neoglacial advances occurred at c. 3700, 3500, 3300, and 1000 14C yr BP; each advance was slightly more extensive than the previous one. Documentary evidence indicates that the pass was still filled with ice in 1913, and diverging both eastward and westward, but glacier retreat has been rapid since then. Retreat from the pass in the mid-20th century resulted in the creation of Strohn Lake, through which meltwater from the glacier passes; a complicated lake history includes switching of discharge from eastward to westward and a series of jokuhlaups that damaged highway infrastructure to the west. A comparison of the history recorded at Bear River Pass with that recorded at the Todd Icefield 15 km to the north shows that different components of glacial history are preserved in different places, and many sites need to be examined to obtain a relatively complete regional history.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things and the lure of smart cities are poised to revolutionize the urban areas of North America. Digital technology has introduced ubiquitous communication and influenced the organization of urban areas in North America, and together this has changed the ways in which people use urban public spaces. Now, the possibilities of the integration of digital technology into the physical infrastructure of the city has technology companies eager to partner with municipalities to realize the economic and managerial benefits of big data. The realities of the implementation of the smart city concept, however, has raised myriad concern around the role of private interests in public life with regards to privacy, ownership, control, and inequality. Many of these concerns play out in public spaces, as they are integral to the enactment of public life in cities while also increasingly funded, and therefore influenced, by private interests. What, then, are future programmatic and technological possibilities for urban public space that seize the opportunities while addressing the concerns?
	This project proposal first seeks to understand the historical and contemporary roles and functions of urban public space and real estate development, as well as big data. Then, it explores the influence of technology on the human understanding and organization of space to unpack the influence of the Internet of Things. Finally, a design project is proposed for the public space in Sidewalk Toronto’s Quayside development that seeks to address these phenomena through the thinking of the philosopher Hannah Arendt.},

The buildable landmasses of Seattle will slowly become submerged leaving many residents to flee and seek higher ground, or adapt. This thesis aims to examine the condition of Seattle in the year 2217 and how a futurist approach to the development of the city is required to continue healthy growth.
Architecture groups such as the Metabolists and Archigram faced similar issues during the 1960s as the field of architecture fell short in dealing with the cultural and infrastructural issues of the time. Their responses required city development to be approach in a different manner, through large scale interventions where conventional building methods were not enough. The projects these groups produced depicted a Utopian future where cites adopted the characteristics of machines through master planning as a means to adapt to change.
This thesis proposes that Seattle adopt a new approach to building and extend the city beyond solid ground, into the air and water, through a massive infrastructural intervention. Vertical pylons will be installed throughout the city in flood prone areas and allow a new type of development to exist in a floating and suspended cityscape. These new typologies of Seattle will be floating, tethered to pre-existing buildings, or suspended above the street level. A futurist approach is necessary when examining the future of Seattle so it may continue to thrive despite rising tides and overpopulation ravaging the city.},

	abstract = {Bioclimatic design is an effective architectural approach for creating environmentally responsive buildings, improving comfort and quality of life for its users while using fewer resources. However, globalization of construction strategies and standardized systems are often applied to various locations without considering the specificity of each climate and site. Thus, working contrary to bioclimatic premises and reducing the overall building performance. This work analyzes the case of the One-Day Church (ODC) global project from Maranatha Volunteers International (MVI), which consists of building churches around the world using a standard roof and frame kit, and local materials. It proposes design improvements for three macro-climates, namely hot-humid, hot-arid, and temperate.
This study reviews the concepts of environmental design for each climate and takes into consideration the organization values and church architecture for this religious group. The baseline model and proposed changes are simulated, and the results show that the strategies were responsible for improving daylighting levels, natural ventilation, envelope performance, and overall hours of comfort. In conclusion, applying a set of variations on the design based on macro-climate requirements can significantly improve the environmental performance of one-size-fits-all designs, creating a better space for those building users. These bioclimatic strategies may be applied to other standardized construction projects, such as emergency shelters, and in general to demonstrate the benefits of a bioclimatic approach.},

	abstract = {A novel architectural design framework built around a massing tool and evolutionary search algorithm is proposed to balance indoor and outdoor environmental conditions and demonstrate the potential for buildings to act as urban climate infrastructure by mitigating heat in dense urban environments. Within these environments, urban heat islands (UHI) are created when building forms, facades and other urban surfaces collectively lower urban cooling rates by altering radiation balances, airflow and moisture levels while increasing anthropogenic heat production. UHIs are associated with human health issues and other negative effects and are exacerbated by warming climates and extreme weather events. Existing UHI research and mitigation strategies address facade design (improved thermal properties, implementation of vegetation), but formal studies are conducted on larger scales than architects can implement into individual building designs.
The proposed framework expands upon existing early-stage architectural design methods to balance considerations of indoor and outdoor environments by generating voxelized building form and facades designs, analyzing each design using environmental simulations and evaluating the population of designs using an evolutionary search algorithm. Indoor environments are evaluated based on energy use intensity (EUI) and unusable daylight levels (uD). Microclimate conditions are evaluated using the Universal Thermal Climate Index model for outdoor thermal comfort (OTC).
The massing tool is composed of scripts that generate sets of control points to alter building massing and distribute facade materials. This approach is flexible enough to pursue a wide array of massing and facade configurations but sufficiently constrained to provide architecturally feasible designs within specific site conditions. Environmental performance simulations analyze microclimate conditions outside and environmental conditions within each iteration. Performance data is passed to an evolutionary search algorithm that determines which parameters to pass to the next population of designs. This process repeats until the user-defined stopping criteria is met. Quantitative information regarding the environmental criteria and building characteristics is used along with qualitative assessments of the design iterations to select a single iteration to develop. Prior to developing the building form and facade, a conceptual building core and column placement can be established to incorporate design considerations relaxed at the start of the framework.
Application of the framework was demonstrated in the development of an alternative design for a 56-story core and shell office tower in downtown Chicago, IL. The framework successfully ran 171 times over three populations. During the hottest week of the year, the generated designs improved outdoor thermal comfort by up to 1.26C, energy use intensity by up to 0.79 kWh/m2 and unusable daylight by up to 50.90\% compared to the existing tower design. The framework established site-specific massing strategies that can mitigate urban heat and improve indoor environment conditions. Architecture firms could use the framework as a massing tool during early stages of design or government bodies could use the framework to inform urban developments.},

to densify within single-family zones currently occupying 80\% of the land.
Densifying the 80\% looks to recreate the low-rise multi-family housing typology to
provide for age and class inclusivity; to design outdoor spaces between that foster
a multitude of connections; and to establish a starting point for the densification of
single-family neighbourhoods.
The project will highlight the connections between the city, neighbourhood, community and
building through pathways, transitions and thresholds. It will emphasize the opportunities
of designing a community around a school’s needs by creating efficient and collaborative
spaces. It will provide an example of how to densify single-family zones in a gentle manner,
and design a community with more consideration on exterior space and unit livability.},

	abstract = {Since the development of modern technology and industry, the window as an architectural element has lost its agency as a mediator of public/private, interior/exterior, individual/collective and has become a simply a product of enclosure. Through the survey of existing regional windows, this thesis works on gaining a better understanding of Vancouver’s cultural milieu by providing a genealogical framework for the foundation of a generative process by critically examining the collective memory of this city.
The proposal will situate itself in the near future, by re-imagining Vancouver’s relationship to the window, where a widespread building envelope failure begins to affect its most ubiquitous building form - the window wall tower. With accruing cost of repair paralyzing many into entropic disarray, a new narrative with the city emerges through the act of re-skinning the existing in order to reconsider its latent potentials.
Strategically, negotiating the existing buildings into the rhetoric of sustainability provides new possibilities nested in the act of repairing. Proposed architecture finds itself working within the rules of the existing while addressing many of its failures that has spiralled the city into a state of crisis. In tapping into the city’s obsession with speculation, this new speculative process based on repair allows dwellers to engage with its environment in an open-ended manner.
To place this projected future, the proposed site will return to the epicentre of where this all began, the Concord Pacific developments on the former Expo lands. Effects of multiplicity, strange familiarity, and urgent imagination compose the language to not only challenge the status quo but openly invites individuals to imagine together what this future might look like.},

To combat these challenges, energy efficiency measures are being deployed to improve the performance of different entities within urban built environments. However, effective implementation of such measures often requires a holistic approach to account for existing interrelated and complex relationships between entities at the urban scale. This paper presents a distillation of salient facts and approaches for energy performance evaluation of districts. The studies are reviewed in three sections; (1) concepts defining district energy performance, (2) approaches and methodologies for district energy performance evaluation and (3) system interactions between district entities. The state of the art review reveals that several challenges exist in the initial stages of energy performance assessment of districts. The suggested framework in this paper addresses this issue through pre-processing of data related to entities such as transportation systems and buildings. The framework classifies the available information under three potential categories, namely, ‘Subject and Scope’, ‘Input Data Management’ and ‘Methods’. This categorisation results in easier integration of multidisciplinary aspects of entities involved in district energy performance assessment.},

Tailored to be suitable for the diverse range of existing buildings in terms of age, size, and use, it combines dynamic energy demand simulation to explore individual retrofit scenarios with an energy hub optimisation. Implemented as an epsilon-constrained mixed integer linear program (MILP), the optimisation matches envelope retrofit with renewable and high efficiency energy supply technologies such as biomass boilers, heat pumps, photovoltaic and solar thermal panels to minimise life cycle cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Due to its multi-objective, integrated assessment of building transformation options and its ability to capture both individual building characteristics and trends within a neighbourhood, this method is aimed to provide developers, neighbourhood and town policy makers with the necessary information to make adequate decisions. Our method is deployed in a case study of typical residential buildings in the Swiss village of Zernez, simulating energy demands in EnergyPlus and solving the optimisation problem with CPLEX. Although common trade-offs in energy system and retrofit choice can be observed, optimisation results suggest that the diversity in building age and size leads to optimal strategies for retrofitting and building system solutions, which are specific to different categories. With this method, GHG emissions of the entire community can be reduced by up to 76\% at a cost increase of 3\% compared to the current emission levels, if an optimised solution is selected for each building category.},

Thus, the cooperative game models where the maximal project profits were allocated between the contract parties were set up. The differences between the non-cooperative and the cooperative scenarios and the impacts of the parameters in the models were also discussed.

As an aid for further research, this paper aims to compile and review relevant literature that may support in choosing a renovation strategy as well as decisions on renovation measures. The focus of this paper is research on status determinations, renovation strategies and renovation measures. Differences and similarities within these areas are presented through the analysis of 234 relevant references. The results show that renovation of multifamily buildings in temperate climate conditions is widely researched. The included research has a strong energy focus, and while other aspects of renovation are researched as well, they are not as strongly represented. Status determinations are often based on data from national databases that include useful information that could help alleviate decision making in the renovation process. This study suggests that future research should be conducted on the effect of such databases on the renovation process. This study also shows that there are numerous renovation strategies, and while there are both in-depth and broader strategies, these are seldom connected. Finally, there are many references evaluating various effects of the application of renovation measures, but some effects and measures are more widely researched than others.

The result is a thorough review of the work done by other authors in relevant fields, comprising the entire spectrum from on-site data acquisition, through the generation of Building Energy Models (BEM), data transfer to energy analysis software and, finally, the identification of major issues throughout this process. Additionally, a BIM-based methodology centered on the acquired knowledge is presented. Solutions for as-built data acquisition such as laser scanning and infrared thermography, and on-site energy tests that benefit the acquisition of energy-related data are explored. The most predominant BIM software regarding not only energy analysis but also model development is examined. In addition, interoperability restrictions between BIM and energy analysis software are addressed using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and Green Building Extensible Markup Language (gbXML) schemes. Lastly, the article argues the future innovations in this subject, predicting future trends and challenges for the industry.},

	abstract = {Energy retrofits have the potential to reduce building energy consumption and carbon emissions, but face particular challenges when implemented in historic and traditionally constructed buildings. Retrofitting these buildings is a complex balancing act, in which many criteria are balanced against one another in order to achieve continued, long-term use of the building. This article reviews the criteria, analysis methods, and decision-making processes used to assess energy retrofits in historic and traditional buildings. First, the criteria are discussed. While energy consumption and conservation are the dominant criteria, a number of others are also important, including the needs of the building fabric, occupants, and collections, as well as economics, embodied energy, and climate change. Second, several analysis methods for estimating or measuring retrofit performance have emerged as particularly useful for historic and traditional buildings, and these are examined. Third, recent efforts to develop consistent guidance and decision-making processes for selecting retrofits are reviewed. Overall, energy retrofits in these buildings are seen not only as a way to reduce energy consumption, but as a means of preserving them for future generations.},

	abstract = {The literature dealing with building energy efficiency has long since debated about the possible occurrence of the so-called Jevons’ paradox. In a nutshell, benefiting from energy savings due to transition to high-performance buildings, may the same savings cause a kind of rebound effect, by acting as an incentive to increase consumptions? On closer inspection, this is not the only paradox affecting the research branch that focuses on the energy used by the buildings and the building industry. A second paradox is that investments in energy-efficient solutions may contribute to energy price control, which in turn lends itself to make the same investments not profitable. A third paradox lies in the need to adopt energy-intensive materials in order to achieve substantial energy savings in operation; hence, sometimes, we just substitute a certain amount of operating energy with a more or less commensurate amount of embodied energy. Here we argue that the joint consideration of the paradoxes mentioned above should not be neglected since it brings with itself several implications needing to be disentangled, whether we aim to get further enhancements in this disciplinary field.},

Thus, various climates can be found, from the polar tundra and cold climate in the Alps and northern European regions, to hot-arid climate in southern parts of Spain. This level of climate diversity makes the European territory interesting for the analysis from the bioclimatic building design perspective. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to assess the bioclimatic potential of selected European locations. The calculation of bioclimatic potential was done by acquiring the typical meteorological year (TMY) data comprised of climate characteristics, such as air temperature, air relative humidity and received solar irradiance, which was later processed by BcChart tool. In order to make bioclimatic potential maps of Europe, the points with uniform point sampling were generated. Furthermore, several additional locations of great interest were selected based on population density. The bioclimatic potential was used to define the prevailing passive building design strategies and measures at the analysed locations. At the same time, the in-depth analysis was conducted using the geospatial data and GIS tools, where the bioclimatic potential results at the selected locations were additionally analysed in relation to Köppen-Geiger climate types. The resulting bioclimatic potential maps can be used as a relevant onset for the policy makers in order to improve regional development strategies for building design.},

The thermal comfort and passive design potential analysis were based on a psychometric chart applying the adaptive comfort model ASHRAE 55–2017. In addition, an evaluation of the bioclimatic potential was conducted using simulations of a monitored and calibrated residential building model in Algeria using EnergyPlus. The building model has been tested in eight previously selected locations. The heating and cooling energy load results were calculated for each climatic zone and compared.

	abstract = {Expert information is a valuable resource in developing robust spatial models to improve understanding and prediction of systems in health, environment, business and society. However, getting experts to reliably activate and encode what they know has proven to be an elusive goal. A root cause of this elusiveness is the fact that expert knowledge is largely tacit, i.e., experts struggle to describe what they know. The imperative to address this goal is increasing. There is a constant need for better models of expert knowledge in organizations, much observational data is sparse and inadequate for spatial modelling, and many domains have knowledgeable workers leaving in numbers. Interviews are often used for eliciting expert knowledge, due to their ease of implementation. However, there is evidence that a lack of appropriate stimuli reduces the quality of knowledge elicited. This paper explores the use of immersive 3D virtual worlds for improved knowledge elicitation, due to their priming effects on memory recall. A case study on habitat prediction for a rock wallaby species is presented, in which the new approach is trialled. This paper is one of the first that aims to combine new virtual spatial technology with expert elicitation for improved spatial statistical modelling.},

As leaders in research in bioclimatic architecture from the early 1950s to the late 1960s, the Olgyay brothers could be considered the ‘fathers’ of contemporary environmental building design. Their research and publications laid the foundation for much of the building simulation software in use today. Other than the difference between working on graph paper and using computer-generated graphics, there is little difference between Autodesk's Ecotect Analysis (simulation and building energy analysis software) and the Olgyays' techniques for the analysis of environmental factors and graphical representation of climate. The manner in which the Olgyays established connections between building design and the science of climate laid the foundation for the development of environmental simulation, one of contemporary architecture's leading methods of form generation. Victor Olgyay's teaching, however, represents another kind of thinking, a broader concern for architecture, beyond energy performance. ‘The primary task of architecture,’ Olgyay announced to his students, ‘is to act in man's favour; to interpose itself between man and his natural surroundings in order to remove the environmental load from his shoulders.},

	abstract = {Expert knowledge is a valuable source of information with a wide range of research applications. Despite the recent advances in defining expert knowledge, little attention has been given to how to view expertise as a system of interacting contributory factors for quantifying an individual's expertise. We present a systems approach to expertise that accounts for many contributing factors and their inter-relationships and allows quantification of an individual's expertise. A Bayesian network (BN) was chosen for this purpose. For illustration, we focused on taxonomic expertise. The model structure was developed in consultation with taxonomists. The relative importance of the factors within the network was determined by a second set of taxonomists (supra-experts) who also provided validation of the model structure. Model performance was assessed by applying the model to hypothetical career states of taxonomists designed to incorporate known differences in career states for model testing. The resulting BN model consisted of 18 primary nodes feeding through one to three higher-order nodes before converging on the target node (Taxonomic Expert). There was strong consistency among node weights provided by the supra-experts for some nodes, but not others. The higher-order nodes, “Quality of work” and “Total productivity”, had the greatest weights. Sensitivity analysis indicated that although some factors had stronger influence in the outer nodes of the network, there was relatively equal influence of the factors leading directly into the target node. Despite the differences in the node weights provided by our supra-experts, there was good agreement among assessments of our hypothetical experts that accurately reflected differences we had specified. This systems approach provides a way of assessing the overall level of expertise of individuals, accounting for multiple contributory factors, and their interactions. Our approach is adaptable to other situations where it is desirable to understand components of expertise.},

Although objective or noninformative priors might be preferred in some situations, in many other applications the Bayesian framework offers a real opportunity to formally combine data with information available from experts. The question addressed in this paper is how to elicit this information in a form suitable for prior modelling. Particular attention is paid to geographic data for which maps might be used to assist in the elicitation. Two case studies are used to illustrate the methodology: estimation of city house prices and prediction of presence of a rare species.},

	abstract = {Numerous expert elicitation methods have been suggested for generalised linear models (GLMs). This paper compares three relatively new approaches to eliciting expert knowledge in a form suitable for Bayesian logistic regression. These methods were trialled on two experts in order to model the habitat suitability of the threatened Australian brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata). The first elicitation approach is a geographically assisted indirect predictive method with a geographic information system (GIS) interface. The second approach is a predictive indirect method which uses an interactive graphical tool. The third method uses a questionnaire to elicit expert knowledge directly about the impact of a habitat variable on the response. Two variables (slope and aspect) are used to examine prior and posterior distributions of the three methods. The results indicate that there are some similarities and dissimilarities between the expert informed priors of the two experts formulated from the different approaches. The choice of elicitation method depends on the statistical knowledge of the expert, their mapping skills, time constraints, accessibility to experts and funding available. This trial reveals that expert knowledge can be important when modelling rare event data, such as threatened species, because experts can provide additional information that may not be represented in the dataset. However care must be taken with the way in which this information is elicited and formulated. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Stochastic building stock energy models account for the uncertainties that are the main limitation in existing building stock models.

It can be argued that a transition from prescriptive to performance-based building regulatory regimes, coupled with the introduction of new policy objectives for sustainability and resiliency, in a rather short period of time, without full assessment of how they interact with existing building regulatory objectives, and without broadly agreed holistic solutions, has led to the introduction of new objectives that have the potential to result in increased hazards and risks to occupants. To explore the current situation and future needs associated with performance building regulatory regimes and the inclusion of sustainability and resiliency objectives for new and existing buildings, the literature was reviewed and a survey of building regulatory bodies and institutions in 12 countries was conducted to obtain perspectives on whether and how sustainability and resiliency objectives are being incorporated into their building regulations and if any challenges have been identified.},

Various policy and technical challenges have been identified with this evolution, including the lack of a common basis for establishing performance expectations, quantified performance metrics, and robust mechanisms to incorporate new objectives in a manner that effectively integrates a diversity of stakeholder input and results in regulatory requirements that do not compete with long-standing objectives. Among the mechanisms being explored to facilitate a managed evolution is the use of risk as a basis for performance, and modifications within the building regulatory environment to enable this. It is posited that framing the building regulatory system as a socio-technical system (STS) will highlight the complex interactions that exist between regulators and the market, the roles stakeholders play in characterizing risk for use in building regulation, and what steps are required to shift to a risk-informed performance-based building regulatory system, taking into account different legal structures and regulatory approaches that exist between jurisdictions.},

	abstract = {The inevitable though frequently informal use of expert opinion in modelling, the increasing number of models that incorporate formally expert opinion from a diverse range of experience and stakeholders, arguments for participatory modelling and analytic-deliberative-adaptive approaches to managing complex environmental problems, and an expanding but uneven literature prompt this critical review and analysis. Aims are to propose common definitions, identify and categorise existing concepts and practice, and provide a frame of reference and guidance for future environmental modelling. The extensive literature review and classification conducted demonstrate that a broad and inclusive definition of experts and expert opinion is both required and part of current practice. Thus an expert can be anyone with relevant and extensive or in-depth experience in relation to a topic of interest. The literature review also exposes informal model assumptions and modeller subjectivity, examines in detail the formal uses of expert opinion and expert systems, and critically analyses the main concepts of, and issues arising in, expert elicitation and the modelling of associated uncertainty. It is noted that model scrutiny and use of expert opinion in modelling will benefit from formal, systematic and transparent procedures that include as wide a range of stakeholders as possible. Enhanced awareness and utilisation of expert opinion is required for modelling that meets the informational needs of deliberative fora. These conclusions in no way diminish the importance of conventional science and scientific opinion but recognise the need for a paradigmatic shift from traditional ideals of unbiased and impartial experts towards unbiased processes of expert contestation and a plurality of expertise and eventually models. Priority must be given to the quality of the enquiry for those responsible for environmental management and policy formulation, and this review emphasises the role for science to maintain and enhance the rigour and formality of the information that informs decision making.},

This heterogeneity consists of four main factors: different authorities involved in energy regulations, traditional building regulations and enforcement models, different contextual characteristics, and maturity of the country in the implementation of energy efficiency measures. These differences are important to take into account country's profile in order to improve the sharing of best-practices and energy efficiency governance among European Union Member States.},

	abstract = {Purpose
- The purpose of this paper is to propose building code changes that would benefit both architectural design and the potential of achieving nearly zero energy goals by analyzing the architectural implications of the energy system boundaries within the Swedish code.
Design/methodology/approach
- The analysis is driven by three questions that relate the national implementation of EU directive on nearly zero energy 2020 to the premises set out in the guidelines for revising the Swedish building code aiming at a performance-based regulation. A crucial part of the research is a comparative analysis of the design implications of the code to research findings in scientific articles on near-zero energy or low-energy design.
Findings
- The energy system boundaries in the Swedish code are steering the architectural design and energy consequences of offices towards using less heat but more electricity. The energy section is also limiting the architectural design choices by ignoring the positive energy aspects of daylight. A proposal of a new comprehensive energy section taking all architectural design related energy aspects into account is presented, in order to support design of nearly zero energy buildings.
Practical implications
- A building code that relates the energy system boundaries to form will help integrated design choices that are more likely to support the strive towards nearly zero energy buildings.
Originality/value
- The paper reveals the design implication of the Swedish energy section to be counterproductive regarding energy efficiency as well as limiting architectural design choices.},

	abstract = {The Building Research \& Information special issue titled ‘Climate Change: National Building Stocks’ (2007) (volume 35, number 4) describes the significance of the existing building stocks. Policies that result in integrated, low-carbon buildings and energy systems that provide people with services (e.g., thermal comfort, lighting, and hot water) are crucial for meeting global challenges. In general, it is easier and cheaper to reduce emissions from buildings with energy efficiency and renewables than in other sectors; therefore, it is probable that greater reductions will be required from buildings than from other sectors. Buildings are long lived, so poor policies for buildings will incur a heavy penalty for many decades into the future. Population growth and urbanization are most rapid in developing countries. Therefore, most new buildings will be constructed there and it is vital these have the highest performance. In developed countries populations are almost static and the built environment changes slowly, so the challenge is to improve existing buildings. Policies must be effective in the implementation of well-known energy efficiency and supply measures in buildings, in terms of both installation and operation. Decarbonizing buildings, as indeed the rest of the energy economy, is not so much a technological problem but more of a social and political problem. Le numéro spécial de Building Research \& Information intitulé ‘Le changement climatique: les parcs de logements nationaux’ (2007) (volume 35, N°4) décrit l'importance du parc de logements existant. Les politiques qui se traduisent par des bâtiments intégrés sobres en carbone et des systèmes énergétiques qui fournissent des services aux occupants (par exemple, le confort thermique, l'éclairage et l'eau chaude) sont essentielles pour relever les défis d'ensemble. D'une manière générale, il est plus facile et moins cher de réduire les émissions provenant de bâtiments efficaces sur le plan de l'énergie et des renouvelables que dans d'autres secteurs. Il est donc probable que des réductions plus importantes seront exigées du secteur du bâtiment que d'autres secteurs. Les bâtiments ont une longue durée de vie utile et ceux de conception médiocre seront fortement pénalisés pendant de nombreuses décennies à venir. La croissance démographique et l'urbanisation sont plus rapides dans les pays en développement. C'est donc dans ces régions que la construction de bâtiments neufs sera la plus importante et il est essentiel que leurs performances soient les meilleures possibles. Dans les pays industrialisés, la démographie est pratiquement statique et le parc bâti évolue lentement; la difficulté réside donc dans l'amélioration des bâtiments existants. Il faut des politiques efficaces de mise en œuvre de mesures bien connues d'efficacité énergétique et de fourniture d'énergie pour les bâtiments, tant en termes d'installation que d'exploitation. La décarbonisation dans le secteur du bâtiment, comme d'ailleurs le reste du secteur énergétique, n'est pas tant un problème technologique qu'un problème social et politique.

	abstract = {Issues raised by the papers in the Building Research \& Information special issue titled ‘Climate Change: National Building Stocks’ (2007) include the need for an explicitly engineering vision of low-energy and low-carbon futures, the need to develop detailed, dynamic models of the interactions between building stocks and energy supply systems, the importance of data in supporting both the development and the implementation of roadmaps to low-carbon futures, the likely role of micro-generation in low-carbon futures, and the phenomenon of rebound and its implications for energy-efficiency technologies. There appears to be consensus on all but the last two. This paper proposes three alternatives to Saunders' formulation of the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate, based on the view that rebound is only likely to be a problem if energy-efficiency improvements are implemented in the absence of a carbon cap. The paper ends by reviewing the interactions between regulatory and economic environment, culture and technology, and their potential impacts on energy use and carbon emissions. Les questions soulevées par les articles du numéro spécial de Building Research \& Information intitulé « Changement Climatique: le Parc Bâti National » (2007) comprennent la nécessité d'une vision permettant de concevoir explicitement un avenir à faible consommation d'énergie et à faible émission de carbone, la nécessité de développer des modèles dynamiques détaillés des interactions entre le parc bâti et les systèmes d'approvisionnement en énergie, l'importance de données permettant d'appuyer à la fois le développement et la mise en œuvre de feuilles de route conduisant à un avenir à faible émission de carbone, le rôle probable de la micro-génération dans un avenir à faible émission de carbone, ainsi que le phénomène de rebond et ses implications pour les technologies à haut rendement énergétique. Un consensus semble exister sur toutes ces questions, sauf les deux dernières. Cet article propose trois alternatives à la formulation par Saunders du postulat de Khazzoom–Brookes, basées sur le point de vue selon lequel ce rebond n'est susceptible de poser problème que si les améliorations en matière de rendement énergétique sont mises en œuvre en l'absence d'un plafonnement du carbone. L'article se termine par l'examen des interactions entre l'environnement réglementaire et économique, la culture et la technologie, et leurs impacts potentiels sur l'utilisation d'énergie et les émissions de carbone.

	abstract = {Modeling assumptions about how buildings will be used and operated have a major role in understanding the gap between predicted and measured energy use of buildings. The present research systematically quantified the impact of occupant modeling approaches on building energy performance across six climate zones of Canada. The impact of occupant modeling approaches was studied by altering the way occupant-related domains are modeled based on two modeling approaches: (1) standard assumptions, and (2) advanced models. Moreover, the impact of building operation modeling assumptions was studied using a simple approach for two domains, air handling unit (AHU) schedule and thermostat adjustment. The simulation results showed that the annual energy use of the building model was affected by advanced occupant models, mostly in milder climate zones. The predicted natural gas energy consumption using advanced models deviated by a factor of two from standard assumptions in the mildest climate zone of Canada. The occupant modeling domain that showed the highest main effect on energy use was lighting. Advanced occupant modeling generally led to a higher deviation of the predicted peak electricity load from standard assumptions in colder climates. AHU schedules and advanced operators' thermostat adjustment model had a higher impact on predicted energy use than occupant modeling. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The meaning of performance-based approach is explained and the current developments of performancebased building energy codes in some representative countries are described. Experience in these countries indicates that performance-based approach in building energy code is important for promoting innovation and new techniques in energy efficient building design. It can also help minimise the limitations of prescriptive criteria which are commonly found in current building control codes. The recent development in Hong Kong to establish a performance-based building energy code is explained to illustrate the practical considerations. The implication of performance concept to the future development of building energy codes in Mainland China is reviewed and discussed. It is found that performance-based codes often require higher level of skills from the designers or users and could be more complicated in the implementation and validation. In order to ensure their success and effectiveness, it is important to build up the institutional and human capacities in the local building industry.},

The installation of solar hot water systems (SHWS) and photovoltaic systems (PV) is considered. After satisfying up to 70\% (if possible) of the service hot water demand in every municipality, PV systems are installed in the remaining roof area. Results show that, applying this performance-based criterion, SHWS would contribute up to 1662ktoe/y of primary energy (or 68.5\% of the total thermal-energy demand for service hot water), while PV systems would provide 10TWh/y of electricity (or 4.0\% of the total electricity demand).},

Together with occupants’ physiological, psychological and cultural demands discussed in the previous chapter, climate defines the boundary conditions under which the building should be designed. Therefore, climatic conditions represent the starting point for any climate adapted design, whereas designers should analytically study the appropriate climatic conditions and in accordance with them propose suitable bioclimatic solutions. During this process, designers should study the macro-, mezzo- and micro-climatic characteristics of the building’s location and select the appropriate influential parameters. In order to be able to conduct such an analysis, some basic knowledge about climate science is crucial. The presented chapter will discuss how and which climatological data to interpret for the purpose of bioclimatic design. The features of four basic generic climate types (i.e. cold, temperate, hot-arid and hot-humid) will be presented by stating the relevant implications for the building design process.},

Bioclimatic potential calculation based on the bioclimatic charts is an example of such a tool. With the use of bioclimatic charts, basic climate data can be correlated with appropriate bioclimatic strategies and corresponding bioclimatic design measures. The result is the evaluation of effectiveness of each individual bioclimatic measure providing indoor thermal comfort on the yearly and/or monthly level. Hence, the calculation of bioclimatic potential represents a starting point on which designers can base their early stage climate adapted building design. However, the results of the conducted analysis are significantly conditioned by the inclusion of the solar radiation impact, as it considerably influences the end result of determined bioclimatic potential. This is of particular interest especially for the heating dominated climates, because it directly outlines the passive solar heating potential. Therefore, the current chapter will present Olgyay’s, Givoni’s and Evans’s bioclimatic charts as well as the necessary process for conducting the bioclimatic potential calculation with the inclusion of solar radiation impact.},

Because building envelope is essential to the provision of appropriate indoor environment, it also directly influences the energy use as well as other sustainability aspects of buildings. Speaking globally, buildings consume vast amounts of energy, have an extremely large environmental impact and are, at least in the urbanised part of the world, our primary habitat. Therefore, it is crucial to design them in such a way that they enable more sustainable future for generations to come. However, buildings as such are not the problem but only the symptom of our society. Therefore, the understanding of the broader picture is needed in order to understand why and how we build.},

	abstract = {In a similar manner as plants, through the millennia animals and humans have adapted to the environmental constraints. In addition, buildings have evolved in order to respond to the environment. Bioclimatic building design is an engineering practice where the primary focus is on the building’s performance in respect to the given environmental conditions as well as the occupant’s needs. The stated goal can be accomplished through multiple approaches, either using passive solutions or active mechanical measures. However, in the light of striving for lower environmental impact and energy use of buildings, passive solutions on the level of the building envelope are preferred, as they will directly influence the operational energy performance of buildings without additional energy use, while providing higher levels of indoor comfort. Central to the notion of bioclimatic building design is the understanding that the most sustainable way to design buildings is firstly to adapt them to the environment and its occupants and in the next step to apply the state of the art technologies in order to enable appropriate functioning throughout their life cycle. Within this chapter, a concise introduction to the field of bioclimatic design will be presented.},

This paper presents a state of the art study through extensive review of the literature, by establishing links between IEQs and occupant well-being and comfort. A range of issues such as sick building syndrome, indoor air quality thermal comfort, visual comfort and acoustic comfort are considered in this paper. The complexity of the relationship between occupant comfort and well-being parameters with IEQ are further exacerbated due to relationships that these parameters have with each other as well. Based on the review of literature in these areas it is established that design of buildings needs to consider occupant well-being parameters right at the beginning. Some good practices in all these different areas have also been highlighted and documented in this paper. The knowledge established as part of this paper would be helpful for researchers, designer, engineers and facilities maintenance engineers. This paper will also be of great benefit to researchers who endeavour to undertake research in this area and could act as a good starting point for them.},

	abstract = {Over the past 15 years, much scientific work has been published on the potential human impacts on climates. For their Third Assessment Report in 2001, the United Nations International Programme on Climate Change developed a set of economic development scenarios, which were then run with the four major general circulation models (GCM) to estimate the anthropogenesis-forced climate change. These GCMs produce worldwide grids of predicted monthly temperature, cloud, and precipitation deviations from the period 1961–1990. As this period is the same used for several major typical meteorological year data sets, these typical data sets can be used as a starting point for modifying weather files to represent predicted climate change. Over the past 50 years, studies of urban heat islands (UHI) or urbanization have provided detailed measurements of the diurnal and seasonal patterns and differences between urban and rural climatic conditions. While heat islands have been shown to be a function of both population and microclimatic and site conditions, they can be generalized into a predictable diurnal and seasonal pattern. Although the scientific literature is full of studies looking at the impact of climate change driven by human activity, there is very little research on the impact of climate change or urban heat islands on building operation and performance across the world. This article presents the methodology used to create weather files which represent climate change scenarios in 2100 and heat island impacts today. For this study, typical and extreme meteorological weather data were created for 25 locations (20 climate regions) to represent a range of predicted climate change and heat island scenarios for building simulation. Then prototypical small office buildings were created to represent typical, good, and low-energy practices around the world. The simulation results for these prototype buildings provide a snapshot view of the potential impacts of the set of climate scenarios on building performance. This includes location-specific building response, such as fuel swapping as heating and cooling ratios change, impacts on environmental emissions, impacts on equipment use and longevity comfort issues, and how low-energy building design incorporating renewables can significantly mitigate any potential climate variation. In this article, examples of how heat island and climate change scenarios affect diurnal patterns are presented as well as the annual energy performance impacts for three of the 25 locations. In cold climates, the net change to annual energy use due to climate change will be positive – reducing energy use on the order of 10\% or more. For tropical climates, buildings will see an increase in overall energy use due to climate change, with some months increasing by more than 20\% from current conditions. Temperate, mid-latitude climates will see the largest change but it will be a swapping from heating to cooling, including a significant reduction of 25\% or more in heating energy and up to 15\% increase in cooling energy. Buildings which are built to current standards such as ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 will still see significant increases in energy demand over the twenty-first century. Low-energy buildings designed to minimize energy use will be the least affected, with impacts in the range of 5–10\%. Unless the way buildings are designed, built, and operated changes significantly over the next decades, buildings will see substantial operating cost increases and possible disruptions in an already strained energy supply system.},

	abstract = {A paradoxical situation exists where vernacular building traditions are in a state of decline and are being replaced by modern counterparts, but they are repeatedly cited in the academic literature as exemplary models of environmental practice. This paradox is examined through research on whether vernacular passive cooling systems in the hot and dry climates of present-day Iran are practicable for the provision of comfortable indoor temperatures. Investigating their technical thermal performance as well as user perceptions and behaviour, positive and negative attributes of the cooling systems are identified. If conclusions about the long-term viability of vernacular buildings are to be drawn, then social, cultural, economic and environmental attributes need to be taken into consideration. Despite rather widespread and persistent assumptions, vernacular building traditions are not necessarily able to survive and the choices made by local people regarding the continuation or abandonment of specific traditions are influenced by a variety of cultural and practical factors. This substantiates the necessity of an integrated and holistic approach that engages with these variables in order to acquire a better understanding of the conditions for the survival of vernacular traditions. Le fait que les traditions architecturales vernaculaires se trouvent dans un état de déclin et sont remplacées par leurs équivalents modernes, alors même qu'elles sont citées à maintes reprises dans la littérature universitaire comme des modèles exemplaires de pratique environnementale, constitue une situation paradoxale. Ce paradoxe est étudié au travers de recherches visant à déterminer si les systèmes de refroidissement passif vernaculaires sous les climats chauds et secs de l'Iran d'aujourd'hui peuvent être mis en pratique pour assurer des températures intérieures confortables. L’étude de leurs performances thermiques techniques aussi bien que des perceptions et du comportement des utilisateurs permet d'identifier les attributs positifs et négatifs des systèmes de refroidissement. S'il faut tirer des conclusions concernant la viabilité à long terme des bâtiments vernaculaires, il est alors nécessaire de prendre en considération les attributs sociaux, culturels, économiques et environnementaux. En dépit de présomptions plutôt répandues et tenaces, les traditions architecturales vernaculaires ne sont pas nécessairement capables de survivre et les choix opérés par les populations locales quant à la poursuite ou l'abandon de traditions spécifiques sont influencés par divers facteurs culturels et pratiques. Ceci confirme la nécessité d'une approche intégrée et holistique qui, par ces variables, incite à acquérir une meilleure compréhension des conditions propres à assurer la survie des traditions vernaculaires.

Regional climatic data from the Klang Valley area in Malaysia were utilised in formulating the design strategies. The most appropriate design strategies for hot, humid regions were then deduced. The most preferred strategies found were the use of ventilation, dehumidification and shading. Consequently, a full recommendation for the integral use of these three passive methods are suggested to be used in all buildings in Malaysia.},

	abstract = {Architectural design based on bioclimatic features has long been of interest to many designers. Exploiting climate indicators and the use of passive strategies are among the central principles of this design approach. The main purpose of the present study is to provide bioclimatic design strategies to enhance the human thermal comfort in the humid climate zones based on Cfa Köppen climate classification. This study focused on to improve indoor thermal comfort with climate indicators. The eight cities studied include Rasht (Iran), Durban (South Africa), Tokyo (Japan), Kutaisi (Georgia), Houston (United States), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Brisbane (Queensland) and Trieste (Italy) according to similarities in the climatic zones and the most important criteria climates such as humidity and rainfall were selected all around the world. Hereafter, the city of Rasht was directly investigated as a case study. In this way at first, the climatic data of Rasht collected. Then it analyzed concerning the Givoni Bioclimatic Chart and Mahoney Table to determine the appropriate bioclimatic design strategies. In the following, these strategies plotted from the Givoni chart and the Mahoney table and the design recommendations provided as diagrams related to the strategies and debated separately. In the end, the executive function of the strategies regarding the relations between the zones of Givoni bioclimatic chart and months of the year, and also the strategies have discussed the indicators of the Mahoney table as well. The extensive findings described in this paper allowed us to conclude that certain bioclimatic design strategies that have been adopted in specific cities and countries could be exported to other zones with similar climates because they were proven to be useful functional architectural design strategies that resulted to improve human indoor thermal comfort.},

This paper answers the question of whether, and at what scale, anticipated changes to mapped flood risk are associated with mitigation actions to accommodate climate change. A case study of the Climate Change Preparedness and Resiliency Checklist in Boston, Massachusetts presents a database of 171 unique survey responses from 104 proposed projects. Comparing developments with documentation to an internal subset of 54 projects in the Boston Planning and Development Agency’s projected Sea Level Rise – Flood Hazard Area (SLR-FHA), this paper finds projects impacted by updated Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are associated with different building uses, higher sea level rise assumptions and greater abilities to endure inundation. There are also neighbourhood-level differences in climate expertise and the projects’ ability to withstand utility disruption. Both of these observed impacts may have important implications for the formulation and application of voluntary resilience standards in other coastal cities.},

An extensive literature review of existing and past practices is used as the main vehicle to analyze: framing and wall insulation methods, architectural details with focus on minimizing thermal bridges, structural adequacy aspects with respect to gravity and lateral loads, and ability to provide fire and sound breaks. In this paper a wide selection of advance framing wall assemblies is discussed in details with main focus on construction methods, architectural details with minimized thermal bridges, and structural (strength) concerns. High performance wall technologies of consideration include: double walls, Larsen truss walls, optimum or advanced framing walls, walls using distance spacers (furring) and walls made of wood-based composites. Since wood framing for wall applications is mostly used in North America, Scandinavia, and Central Europe, this study is focused on research studies from these regions. In addition, field test studies are presented discussing an application of high R-value of new and retrofitted wall assemblies in actual test houses that have been constructed and being currently monitored.},

	abstract = {Buildings play an important role in greenhouse gas emissions since they constitute a large proportion of the global energy demand. This dramatic scenario is usually a consequence of poor thermal insulation characteristics of building fabric. Among the elements of a typical building envelope, windows are responsible for the greatest energy loss due to their notably high overall heat transfer coefficients (U-values). About 60\% of heat loss through the fabric of residential buildings can be attributed to the glazed areas. Windows are useful multifunctional devices for buildings which provide passive solar gain, air ventilation and also the ability to view the outside. However, they greatly dominate the heating and cooling demand of buildings in winter and summer, respectively. Conventional window technologies tend to have poor U-values which cause significant heat losses during the winter season and undesired heat gain in summer. Unique glazing technologies are therefore required to improve visual and thermal comfort of the occupants, whilst mitigating the energy consumption of buildings. In the present work, a comprehensive review of the latest developments in glazing technologies is presented. Currently available high performance glazing products and technologies are analyzed in detail with application examples.},

	abstract = {Certifications such as the Passive House aim to reduce the final space heating energy demand of residential buildings. The latter are responsible for a significant share of final energy consumption in Europe of which nearly 70\% is associated with space conditioning, notably heating. The improvement of the energy efficiency of residential buildings, in terms of space heating, can therefore reduce their total energy demand. However, most certifications totally overlook other energy requirements associated with residential buildings. Studies on passive houses do not take into consideration the embodied energy required to manufacture the building materials, especially the large amount of insulation required to achieve high operational efficiencies. At an urban scale, most passive houses are single family detached houses located in low density suburbs with a high car usage, resulting in considerable transport related energy demand. This paper analyses the total life cycle energy demand of a typical Belgian passive house, comprising embodied, operational and transport energy. It relies on a comprehensive technique developed by Stephan et al. [1] and conducts a parametric analysis as well as a comparison to alternative building types. Results show that current building energy efficiency certifications might not ensure a lower energy demand and can, paradoxically result in an increased energy consumption because of their limited scope. More comprehensive system boundaries should be used to make sure that net energy savings do occur. The embodied energy of passive houses can represent up to 77\% of the total embodied and operational energy over 100years. Also passive houses can have nearly the same energy consumption as a standard new house with the same geometry, location and number of occupants. A retrofitted apartment in the city has an energy consumption 15.2\% lower than the best passive house scenario.},

	abstract = {Buildings in cities consume 30–70\% of total primary energy, and improving building energy efficiency is one of the key strategies towards sustainable urbanization. Urban building energy models (UBEM) can support city managers to evaluate and prioritize energy conservation measures (ECMs) for investment and the design of incentive and rebate programs. This paper presents the retrofit analysis feature of City Building Energy Saver (CityBES) to automatically generate and simulate UBEM using EnergyPlus based on cities’ building datasets and user-selected ECMs. CityBES is a new open web-based tool to support city-scale building energy efficiency strategic plans and programs. The technical details of using CityBES for UBEM generation and simulation are introduced, including the workflow, key assumptions, and major databases. Also presented is a case study that analyzes the potential retrofit energy use and energy cost savings of five individual ECMs and two measure packages for 940 office and retail buildings in six city districts in northeast San Francisco, United States. The results show that: (1) all five measures together can save 23–38\% of site energy per building; (2) replacing lighting with light-emitting diode lamps and adding air economizers to existing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are most cost-effective with an average payback of 2.0 and 4.3years, respectively; and (3) it is not economical to upgrade HVAC systems or replace windows in San Francisco due to the city’s mild climate and minimal cooling and heating loads. The CityBES retrofit analysis feature does not require users to have deep knowledge of building systems or technologies for the generation and simulation of building energy models, which helps overcome major technical barriers for city managers and their consultants to adopt UBEM.},

At the same time, the need to increase the building retrofit rate in a sustainable way can find advantageous applications through local renewable energy systems (RES) such as photovoltaics. However, the energy demand of existing buildings (and energy retrofit measures) and the potential RES production have been generally considered as separated disciplinary fields so far. Conversely, a synergic and integrated approach can be more efficient in terms of time and/or costs and can bring to novel urban energy strategies and policies enhancing the energy retrofit rate and the integration of photovoltaic in buildings (BIPV). Therefore, thanks to systematic analysis of the literature of these two disciplinary fields in terms of approaches, methods, tools and analysed characteristics, this paper aims at identifying their synergies, which can allow to set the basis for an integrated assessment of the urban BIPV retrofit potential for facades. Indeed, differently from other RES, BIPV, as multifunctional element, can both improve the energy performance of building envelopes and produce electricity from solar radiation in urban contexts.},

An office building is analyzed, with reference to the entire cooling season (from May 1st to September 30th), in reliable conditions as regards building use, and thus internal gains, occupancy, activation of cooling systems. More in detail, through hourly energy simulation, the achievable cooling energy savings have been calculated, with reference to a well-insulated massive building, refurbished by means of addition of PCM plaster on the inner side of the exterior envelope. Five Mediterranean climates have been taken into account: Ankara (Turkey), Athens (Greece), Naples (Italy), Marseille (France), Seville (Spain). The studies regarded the influences of the phase change temperature, thickness of the PCM wallboard and location of the PCM layer. Beyond the evaluation of the absolute savings of primary energy requests for cooling, the energy saving rate and the not-overheating time have been calculated, respectively by considering an air conditioned building and a naturally ventilated building with free-running indoor temperatures. Starting from the achieved results, through the values of the proposed indicators, this paper would suggest information useful for proper design and selection of phase change materials for building applications.},

	abstract = {Aim
This paper presents a two-fold evaluation method determining whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building.
Scope
The method determines a combination of energy saving measures that have been optimised in regards to the future cost for energy. Subsequently, the method evaluates the cost of undertaking the retrofit measures as compared to the cost of demolishing the existing building and thereafter erecting a new one. Several economically beneficial combinations of energy saving measures can be determined. All of them are a trade-off between investing in retrofit measures and buying renewable energy. The overall cost of the renovation considers the market value of the property, the investment in the renovation, the operational and maintenance costs. A multi-family building is used as an example to clearly illustrate the application of the method from macroeconomic and private financial perspectives.
Conclusion
The example shows that the investment cost and future market value of the building are the dominant factors in deciding whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building. Additionally, it is concluded in the example that multi-family buildings erected in the period 1850–1930 should be renovated.},

	abstract = {The refinement of architectural space plays a catalytic role in the building’s energy balance. A different configuration on the deep energy building retrofit is presented on this paper, by proposing mainly strategies that hierarchize in a high position the invigoration of the building’s architectural design principals. These space qualities enable diversity of occupancy, environmental variability and facilitate the building envelope to operate efficiently as climate moderator. The main working hypothesis claims that bioclimatic trends, derived from primary architectural decisions of the early design phase, predispose the final energy performance of the existing building.Based on that, the alternative retrofit proposal called Architectural Energy Retrofit (AER) strategy, focuses on the energy genetic code of these basic architectural features. It argues that their holistic revival and refinement, indoors and outdoors will pave the way for the building’s energy retrofit and the space’s regeneration. As a case study to test this theory, an old and energy-consuming school complex is selected. By applying solely architectural interventions, a reduction of 44\% energy demands was achieved. The results highlighted the challenges of “quantifying” the energy efficiency of architecture. However, by exploring and focusing on the non-energy, co-benefits, it also seeks to expand the perspective of energy efficiency beyond the traditional measures, by identifying and measuring its impacts across many different spheres. AER, as a counterproposal, wishes to add a new base of discussion on deep energy retrofit strategies as it follows a diametrically opposed direction than the typical practices. The building instead of being “sealed”and its environment kept strictly controlled, it “opens” and interacts with its surroundings.},

Introduction Despite the existence of institutions designed to promote peace, interactions between individuals and groups sometimes lead to conflict. Understanding the causes of such conflict is a major project in the social sciences, and researchers in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible. Recent advances and interest have prompted an explosion of quantitative studies on this question.

Evidence that temperature influences the risk of modern human conflict: (A) local violence in 1° grid cells, (B) civil war in countries, and (C) civil conflict risk in the tropics. The map depicts regions of analysis corresponding to nonparametric watercolor regressions in (A) to (C). The color intensity in (A) to (C) indicates the level of certainty in the regression line.
Methods We carried out a comprehensive synthesis of the rapidly growing literature on climate and human conflict. We examined many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal violence and crime to intergroup violence and political instability and further to institutional breakdown and the collapse of civilizations. We focused on quantitative studies that can reliably infer causal associations between climate variables and conflict outcomes. The studies we examined are experiments or “natural experiments”; the latter exploit variations in climate over time that are plausibly independent of other variables that also affect conflict. In many cases, we obtained original data from studies that did not meet this criterion and used a common statistical method to reanalyze these data. In total, we evaluated 60 primary studies that have examined 45 different conflict data sets. We collected findings across time periods spanning 10,000 BCE to the present and across all major world regions.
ResultsDeviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially. This relationship is apparent across spatial scales ranging from a single building to the globe and at temporal scales ranging from an anomalous hour to an anomalous millennium. Our meta-analysis of studies that examine populations in the post-1950 era suggests that the magnitude of climate’s influence on modern conflict is both substantial and highly statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001). Each 1-SD change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall increases the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4\% and intergroup conflict by 14\% (median estimates).
DiscussionWe conclude that there is more agreement across studies regarding the influence of climate on human conflict than has been recognized previously. Given the large potential changes in precipitation and temperature regimes projected for the coming decades—with locations throughout the inhabited world expected to warm by 2 to 4 SDs by 2050—amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries.
Climate and Conflict
Knowledge silos can hinder attempts to explore questions of interest across many disciplines. Hsiang et al. (p. 1235367, published online 1 August) provide a meta-analysis of data from disciplines as disparate as archaeology and psychology to examine the relation between climate and conflict. Overall, warmer temperatures or extremes of rainfall can be causally associated with changes in interpersonal violence and in civil war.
A rapidly growing body of research examines whether human conflict can be affected by climatic changes. Drawing from archaeology, criminology, economics, geography, history, political science, and psychology, we assemble and analyze the 60 most rigorous quantitative studies and document, for the first time, a striking convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate’s influence is substantial: for each one standard deviation (1σ) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4\% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14\%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2σ to 4σ by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.
Across disciplinary boundaries, recently published evidence links climate change to increased violent conflict.

	abstract = {Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact on the functioning of modern human societies1,2, but effects on economic activity appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even in wealthy countries3,4. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature5, while poor countries respond only linearly5,6. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled human-natural systems7,8 and to anticipating the global impact of climate change9,10. Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is nonlinear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an annual average temperature of 13 6C and declining strongly at higher temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960, and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation for modelling economic loss in response to climate change11,12, with important implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23\% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times larger than leading models indicate.},

BACKGROUNDFor centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research has begun to illuminate key linkages in the coupling of these complex natural and human systems, uncovering notable effects of climate on health, agriculture, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics.
ADVANCESPast scholars of climate-society interactions were limited to theorizing on the basis of anecdotal evidence; advances in computing, data availability, and study design now allow researchers to draw generalizable causal inferences tying climatic events to social outcomes. This endeavor has demonstrated that a range of climate factors have substantial influence on societies and economies, both past and present, with important implications for the future.Temperature, in particular, exerts remarkable influence over human systems at many social scales; heat induces mortality, has lasting impact on fetuses and infants, and incites aggression and violence while lowering human productivity. High temperatures also damage crops, inflate electricity demand, and may trigger population movements within and across national borders. Tropical cyclones cause mortality, damage assets, and reduce economic output for long periods. Precipitation extremes harm economies and populations predominately in agriculturally dependent settings. These effects are often quantitatively substantial; for example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields roughly 48\%, warming trends since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by 11\%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by 0.28 percentage points year−1. Much research aims to forecast impacts of future climate change, but we point out that society may also benefit from attending to ongoing impacts of climate in the present, because current climatic conditions impose economic and social burdens on populations today that rival in magnitude the projected end-of-century impacts of climate change. For instance, we calculate that current temperature climatologies slow global economic growth roughly 0.25 percentage points year−1, comparable to the additional slowing of 0.28 percentage points year−1 projected from future warming.Both current and future losses can theoretically be avoided if populations adapt to fully insulate themselves from the climate—why this has not already occurred everywhere remains a critical open question. For example, clear patterns of adaptation in health impacts and in response to tropical cyclones contrast strongly with limited adaptation in agricultural and macroeconomic responses to temperature. Although some theories suggest these various levels of adaptation ought to be economically optimal, in the sense that costs of additional adaptive actions should exactly balance the benefits of avoided climate-related losses, there is no evidence that allows us to determine how closely observed “adaptation gaps” reflect optimal investments or constrained suboptimal adaptation that should be addressed through policy.
OUTLOOKRecent findings provide insight into the historical evolution of the global economy; they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we understand the consequences of future climate changes. Although climate is clearly not the only factor that affects social and economic outcomes, new quantitative measurements reveal that it is a major factor, often with first-order consequences. Research over the coming decade will seek to understand the numerous mechanisms that drive these effects, with the hope that policy may interfere with the most damaging pathways of influence. Both current and future generations will benefit from near-term investigations. “Cracking the code” on when, where, and why adaptation is or is not successful will generate major social benefits today and in the future. In addition, calculations used to design global climate change policies require as input “damage functions” that describe how social and economic losses accrue under different climatic conditions, essential elements that now can (and should) be calibrated to real-world relationships. Designing effective, efficient, and fair policies to manage anthropogenic climate change requires that we possess a quantitative grasp of how different investments today may affect economic and social possibilities in the future. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6304/aad9837/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Two globes depict two possible futures for how the climate might change and how those changes are likely to affect humanity, based on recent empirical findings.Base colors are temperature change under “Business as usual” (left, RCP 8.5) and “stringent emissions mitigation” (right, RCP 2.6).

For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions—such as temperature, rainfall, and violent storms—influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by {\textasciitilde}48\%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by {\textasciitilde}11\%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by {\textasciitilde}0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.},

This implies the adoption of reference years remarkably warmer or colder than typical ones. Nevertheless, while several researches in the literature and technical standards provide instructions to build typical years, there is no standard procedure for the extreme ones. In this work, starting from the approach described by EN ISO 15927-4:2005 for typical reference years, TRYEN, based on Finkelstein-Schafer statistics of weather variables, a new method is proposed to develop hot and cold extreme reference years, ERYh and ERYc, from multi-year hourly weather series. Two alternatives are evaluated for the selection of reference months – according just to dry bulb temperature statistics or also considering global horizontal irradiance ones. To discuss the representativeness of proposed reference years against multi-year series, TRNSYS simulations are run for 48 simplified buildings in five Italian climates.},

	abstract = {A method for synthesizing representative weather data for future climate out of regional climate models (RCMs) was introduced previously for the energy simulation of buildings (Nik, 2016). The method suggests creating one typical and two extreme data sets based on the distribution of the outdoor dry bulb temperature (Tdrybulb). This article extends the application of such weather data in the hygrothermal simulation of buildings by simulating a pre-fabricated wooden frame wall. To investigate the importance of considering moisture and rain conditions in creating the representative weather files, two more groups of weather data are synthesized based on the distribution of the equivalent temperature (Tequivalent) and rain. Moisture content, relative humidity, temperature and mould growth rate are calculated in the façade and insulation layers of the wall for several weather data sets. Results show that the synthesized weather data based on Tdry bulb predict the hygrothermal conditions inside the wall very similar to the original RCM weather data and there is no considerable advantage in using the other two weather data groups. This study confirms the applicability of the synthesized weather data based on Tdry bulb and emphasizes the importance of considering extreme scenarios in the calculations. This enables having distributions more similar to the original RCM data while the simulation load is decreased enormously.},

Two soil types with different soil thickness on the building roof were also simulated.

	abstract = {Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal—for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate “good” and “bad” models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models.},

	abstract = {Combating climate change requires unified action across all sectors of society. However, this collective action is precluded by the ‘consensus gap’ between scientific knowledge and public opinion. Here, we test the extent to which the iconic cities around the world are likely to shift in response to climate change. By analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we test if their climate in 2050 will resemble more closely to their own current climate conditions or to the current conditions of other cities in different bioclimatic regions. Even under an optimistic climate scenario (RCP 4.5), we found that 77\% of future cities are very likely to experience a climate that is closer to that of another existing city than to its own current climate. In addition, 22\% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. As a general trend, we found that all the cities tend to shift towards the sub-tropics, with cities from the Northern hemisphere shifting to warmer conditions, on average {\textasciitilde}1000 km south (velocity {\textasciitilde}20 km.year-1), and cities from the tropics shifting to drier conditions. We notably predict that Madrid’s climate in 2050 will resemble Marrakech’s climate today, Stockholm will resemble Budapest, London to Barcelona, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Tokyo to Changsha. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. The global assessment of city analogues can facilitate the understanding of climate change at a global level but also help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, which can facilitate effective decision-making in response to on-going climate change.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantiﬁed uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Paciﬁc. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with signiﬁcant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identiﬁed areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledgebased methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {Based on the analyses of data from two distinct measurement campaigns conducted in residential indoor environments in Japan and Switzerland, we identify the specificities of occupants’ behaviour with respect to their interactions with windows, including the choice of opening angles for axial openings. As a first step, each dataset is analysed to develop separate predictive models which account for the specificities of window usage in the residential context. The predictive accuracy of these models is then challenged by validation on external data: using models inferred from data obtained from one survey, actions on windows are simulated for the other survey and the predictions are compared with observations. Dynamic models developed using data from office buildings as well as previously published models are also compared using this verification procedure. In the case of the Swiss dataset, these analyses demonstrate the ability of carefully formulated behavioural models developed from office environment data to reliably predict window usage in a residential context and vice-versa. However, we observe that the same models perform less satisfactorily in the prediction of window usage in Japan. From these results it seems that such models require specific calibration in the case of buildings equipped with an air-conditioning unit as was the case for the hot and humid summer climate of Japan.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}°C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantiﬁed uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Paciﬁc. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with signiﬁcant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identiﬁed areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledgebased methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Spatial analog techniques consist in identifying locations whose historical climate is similar to the anticipated future climate at a reference location. In the process of identifying analogs, one key step is the quantification of the dissimilarity between two climates separated in time and space, which involves the choice of a metric. In this study, six a priori suitable metrics are described (the standardized Euclidean distance, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, the nearest-neighbor distance, the Zech-Aslan energy statistic, the Friedman-Rafsky runs statistic, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence) and criteria are proposed and investigated in an attempt to identify the best metric for selecting spatial analogs. The case study involves the use of numerical simulations performed with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM, version 4.2.3), from which three annual indicators (total precipitation, heating degree-days, and cooling degree-days) are calculated over 30-yr periods (1971-2000 and 2041-70). It is found that the six metrics identify comparable analog regions at a relatively large scale but that best analogs may differ substantially. For best analogs, it is shown that the uncertainty stemming from the metric choice does not generally exceed that stemming from the simulation or model choice.On the basis of the set of criteria considered in this study, the Zech-Aslan energy statistic stands out as the most recommended metric for analog studies, whereas the Friedman-Rafsky runs statistic is the least recommended.

With so many of the renewable energy sources being significantly dependent on weather, it is essential that the temporal and geospatial variability and distribution of climatic design parameters are investigated for effective planning and operation. ASHRAE-HOF is the most widely used climatic design conditions database for building energy and HVAC professionals, but gaps exist in the literature on the geospatial and temporal distributions of the HOF dataset. This research explored geospatial distributions of key HOF (2009) climatic parameters: temperature (dry-bulb, wet-bulb, dew-point and mean) and degree-days at various temporal scales. Identified spatial variability illustrate the effects of latitude, elevation, landuse and nearest coastline. Observed trends agree with conventional wisdom; however, sparse coverage in populated areas such as Africa and Asia diminish the versatility of the database. Variations in temperature exist, even between closely spaced sites – emphasizing the need to use location-specific data for enhancing the accuracy of the weather-related analysis. Moreover, latitudinal similarities in the distribution offer potential in identifying candidate locations for reciprocal transfer of knowledge on environmental design and operation.},

Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province’s area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC’s ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.},

	abstract = {There is a deep disconnect between scientific and public concern about climate change. One reason is that global climate change is a fairly abstract concept with little perceived relevance, so a key challenge is to translate climate-change projections into locally concrete examples of potential impacts. Here we use climate analog analyses as an alternative method for identifying and communicating climate-change impacts. Our analysis uses multiple downscaled general circulation models for the state of Wisconsin, at 0.1 decimal degree resolution, and identifies contemporary locations in North America that are the most similar to the projected future climates for Wisconsin. We assess the uncertainties inherent in climate-change projections among greenhouse gas emission scenarios, time windows (mid-21st century vs. late 21st-century) and different combinations of climate variables. For all future scenarios and simulations, contemporary climatic analogs within North America were found for Wisconsin’s future climate. Closest analogs are primarily 200–500 km to the south-southwest of their Wisconsin reference location. Temperature has the largest effect on choice of climatic analog, but precipitation is the greatest source of uncertainty. Under the higher-end emission scenarios, the contemporary climatic analogs for Wisconsin’s end-21st-century climates are almost entirely outside the state. Climate-analog analyses offer a place-based means of assessing climate impacts that is complementary to the species-based approaches of species distributional models, and carries no assumptions about the characterization and conservatism of species niches. The analog method is simple and flexible, and can be readily extended to other regions and other environmental variables.},

	abstract = {Climate change can be thought of in terms of geographical shifts in climate properties. Examples include assessments of shifts in habitat distributions1, of the movement needed to maintain constant temperature or precipitation2, and of the emergence and disappearance of climate zones3. Here I track the movement of analogue climates within climate models. From the model simulations, I define a set of vectors that link a historical reference climate for each location to the location in a changed climate whose seasonal temperature and precipitation cycles best match the reference climate. I use these vectors to calculate the change in vegetation carbon storage with climate change due to ecosystems following climate analogues. Comparing the derived carbon content change to direct carbon projections by coupled carbon–climate models reveals two regions of divergence. In the tropical forests, vector projections are fundamentally uncertain because of a lack of close climatic analogues. In the southern boreal forest, carbon losses are projected in the vector perspective because low-carbon ecosystems shift polewards. However, the majority of carbon–climate models—typically without explicit simulation of the disturbance and mortality processes behind such shifts—instead project vegetation carbon gains throughout the boreal region. Southern boreal carbon loss as a result of ecosystem shift is likely to offset carbon gains from northern boreal forest expansion.},

Combining observations of current maximum-attainable yield with climate analogues, we provide a complementary method of assessing the effect of climate change on crop yields. Strong reductions in attainable yields of major cereal crops are found across a large fraction of current cropland by 2050. These areas are vulnerable to climate change and have greatly reduced opportunity for agricultural intensification. However, the total land area, including regions not currently used for crops, climatically suitable for high attainable yields of maize, wheat and rice is similar by 2050 to the present-day. Large shifts in land-use patterns and crop choice will likely be necessary to sustain production growth rates and keep pace with demand.},

Opportunities for such range shifts may be limited unless areas that facilitate dispersal under climate change are identified and protected from land uses that impede movement. While many climate adaptation strategies focus on identifying refugia, this study is the first to characterize areas which merit protection for their role in promoting climate connectivity at a continental extent. We identified climate connectivity areas across North America by delineating paths between current climate types and their future analogs that avoided nonanalogous climates, and used centrality metrics to rank the contribution of each location to facilitating dispersal across the landscape. The distribution of connectivity areas was influenced by climatic and topographic factors at multiple spatial scales. Results were robust to uncertainty in the magnitude of future climate change arising from differing emissions scenarios and general circulation models, but sensitive to analysis extent and assumptions concerning dispersal behavior and maximum dispersal distance. Paths were funneled along north-south trending passes and valley systems and away from areas of novel and disappearing climates. Climate connectivity areas, where many potential dispersal paths overlapped, were distinct from refugia and thus poorly captured by many existing conservation strategies. Existing protected areas with high connectivity values were found in southern Mexico, the southwestern US, and western and arctic Canada and Alaska. Ecoregions within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Great Plains, eastern temperate forests, high Arctic, and western Canadian Cordillera hold important climate connectivity areas which merit increased conservation focus due to anthropogenic pressures or current low levels of protection. Our coarse-filter climate-type-based results complement and contextualize species-specific analyses and add a missing dimension to climate adaptation planning by identifying landscape features which promote connectivity among refugia.},

reduced

paradoxical: they offer us new systems to study and new

	abstract = {What are the actual barriers and drivers for sustainable building? A literature review, interviews and case studies are presented to address this question. Sustainable building is not hindered by a lack of technologies and assessment methods, but is instead beset with organizational and procedural difficulties entailed by the adoption of new methods. New technologies are resisted because they require process changes entailing risks and unforeseen costs. These hindrances can be reduced by learning what kind of decision-making phases, new tasks, actors, roles and ways of networking are needed. The barriers are outlined as steering mechanisms, economics, a lack of client understanding, process (procurement and tendering, timing, cooperation and networking), and underpinning knowledge (knowledge and common language, the availability of methods and tools, innovation). The most important actions to promote sustainable building are the development of the awareness of clients about the benefits of sustainable building, the development and adoption of methods for sustainable building requirement management, the mobilization of sustainable building tools, the development of designers' competence and team working, and the development of new concepts and services. The interviews and case studies were carried out in Finland, but the results may be applicable or interesting to other countries as well. Quels sont les obstacles et les vecteurs actuels en matière de construction de bâtiments durables ? Il est présenté une analyse bibliographique, des entretiens et des études de cas afin d'examiner cette question. La construction de bâtiments durables n'est pas entravée par un manque de technologies et de méthodes d'évaluation, mais est plutôt en butte à de multiples difficultés organisationnelles et procédurales occasionnées par l'adoption de méthodes nouvelles. Il y a une résistance aux nouvelles technologies parce qu'elles nécessitent des modifications des processus entraînant des risques et des coûts imprévus. Il est possible de réduire ces entraves en faisant l'apprentissage de ce qui est nécessaire, s'agissant des phases de prise de décision, des nouvelles tâches, des nouveaux acteurs, des nouvelles fonctions et des nouveaux modes de mise en réseau. Les obstacles passés en revue concernent les mécanismes de pilotage, l'économie, un manque de compréhension des clients, les processus (achats et appels d'offres, timing, coopération et mise en réseau) et les connaissances de base (connaissances et langage commun, disponibilité des méthodes et des outils, innovation). Les mesures les plus importantes pour promouvoir la construction de bâtiments durables sont le développement de la sensibilisation des clients aux avantages d'un bâtiment durable, le développement et l'adoption de méthodes de gestion des exigences propres aux bâtiments durables, la mobilisation des outils de construction durable, le développement des compétences des concepteurs et du travail d'équipe, et le développement de concepts et de services nouveaux. Les entretiens et les études de cas ont été réalisés en Finlande, mais les résultats peuvent également s'appliquer à d'autres pays ou présenter un intérêt pour d'autres pays.

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

	abstract = {Novel climates – emerging conditions with no analog in the observational record – are an open problem in ecological modeling. Detecting extrapolation into novel conditions is a critical step in evaluating bioclimatic projections of how species and ecosystems will respond to climate change. However, biologically informed novelty detection methods remain elusive for many modeling algorithms. To assist with bioclimatic model design and evaluation, we present a first-approximation assessment of general novelty based on a simple and consistent characterization of climate. We build on the seminal global analysis of Williams et al. (2007 PNAS, 104, 5738) by assessing of end-of-21st-century novelty for North America at high spatial resolution and by refining their standardized Euclidean distance into an intuitive Mahalanobian metric called sigma dissimilarity. Like this previous study, we found extensive novelty in end-of-21st-century projections for the warm southern margin of the continent as well as the western Arctic. In addition, we detected localized novelty in lower topographic positions at all latitudes: By the end of the 21st century, novel climates are projected to emerge at low elevations in 80\% and 99\% of ecoregions in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, respectively. Novel climates are limited to 7\% of the continent's area in RCP4.5, but are much more extensive in RCP8.5 (40\% of area). These three risk factors for novel climates – regional susceptibility, topographic position, and the magnitude of projected climate change – represent a priori evaluation criteria for the credibility of bioclimatic projections. Our findings indicate that novel climates can emerge in any landscape. Interpreting climatic novelty in the context of nonlinear biological responses to climate is an important challenge for future research.},

This paper uses a modelling approach to evaluate the effectiveness of technical and lifestyle measures to reduce energy demand in six households based on monitoring data and insights from interviews. The results are benchmarked against estimated tailored 2050 reduction targets and demonstrate that although these targets are achievable in the studied homes, householders might not always be willing to apply them. The resultant reduction pathways are shown to vary significantly between households, suggesting that bespoke strategies are needed to allow households to identify and select the most appropriate methods that allow them to maximize demand reduction.},

The parameters cover economic, social, environmental, technical, and policy issues. Through visual representation of the outputs, the tool can be used to compare the merits of timber construction in different locations. Three locations are used to demonstrate the applicability of the diagnostic tool: the province of British Columbia (Canada), the state of São Paulo (Brazil), and the province of Quebec (Canada). An analysis of these locations reveals the capacity of the tool to identify the barriers, risks, and development opportunities for each location.

Here we assess the diurnal and seasonal variation of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) defined as the surface temperature difference between urban area and suburban area measured from the MODIS. Differences in SUHII are analyzed across 419 global big cities, and we assess several potential biophysical and socio-economic driving factors. Across the big cities, we show that the average annual daytime SUHII (1.5 ± 1.2 °C) is higher than the annual nighttime SUHII (1.1 ± 0.5 °C) (P {\textless} 0.001). But no correlation is found between daytime and nighttime SUHII across big cities (P = 0.84), suggesting different driving mechanisms between day and night. The distribution of nighttime SUHII correlates positively with the difference in albedo and nighttime light between urban area and suburban area, while the distribution of daytime SUHII correlates negatively across cities with the difference of vegetation cover and activity between urban and suburban areas. Our results emphasize the key role of vegetation feedbacks in attenuating SUHII of big cities during the day, in particular during the growing season, further highlighting that increasing urban vegetation cover could be one effective way to mitigate the urban heat island effect.},

	abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has become a concern in many major cities worldwide, as high summer temperatures and poor wind flow can have negative impacts on city dwellers, particularly increasing energy demand for artificial cooling. This paper showcases how an Integrated Multi-scale Environmental Urban Model (IMEUM) can be employed to support planners, architects and engineers to assess the combined impacts of the UHI phenomenon and rising global temperatures due to climate change. IMEUM concept derives from downscaling environmental models from global scale (25km) to mesoscale (1km) and city scale (100m). Hence, this paper showcases a computationally efficient method which couples multi-scale atmospheric models with statistical model to estimate weather parameters. Developed under Singapore context, IMEUM can be utilized to incorporate appropriate UHI mitigation measures upfront in design process, consecutively bridging the gap between global and building scale. This paper also includes calibration of the IMEUM output using observations from ground sensors. Furthermore, by using case study of a hypothetical office building, this paper showcases how the IMEUM output can be fully converted into a localized weather data file for cooling load simulation. IMEUM is currently being developed further into integrated quantitative urban environment simulation tool (QUEST), which can be used to test the immediate microclimatic impact of development plans and assess their long term impacts under future climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {During the last few years, the merging of timber building tradition with the application of new technologies has produced new prefabricated building systems in Europe and North America. Mid-rise buildings present a unique opportunity to apply new timber technologies. 
Chile has shown sustained growth of buildings construction during the past decades but little further development in the use of wood.  To establish the feasibility of timber systems applied to the Chilean context this research considered social aspects, technical aspects and local standards related to the manufacture and construction using timber components. A project proposal is used to analyze the architectural applications of timber systems according to the Chilean context. The design considers the case of densification in the city of Santiago and investigates the possibility of developing mid-rise structures using the structural properties and features of timber systems. So far only two systems applied to mid-rise structures have been tested for seismic resistance on full scale prototypes: Midply and Cross Laminated Timber. 
Both systems are suitable for the Chilean context despite their different features. However, it is essential to modify the Chilean Structural Code in order to properly incorporate the seismic performance of timber structures. Also, further research is needed on the application of softwoods and local construction techniques are required for timber panel systems in order to change the negative perception of users about timber housing.
The Chilean context has interesting design opportunities to develop buildings that use prefabricated timber panel systems. These structures are flexible, light and have shear high-resistance.  However, it is necessary further exploration on architectural possibilities that could expand the use of these alternatives.},

	url = {https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0135612},
	abstract = {A strong correlation exists between inadequate housing and stress, and between stress and health. Studies have found that inadequate housing places both mental and physical stress on residents and that families and individuals living in low-income housing are often facing more stress and suffer from ill health more than those living in market housing. Salutogenesis, a concept developed by Aaron Antonovsky, focuses on what causes health rather than what causes illness. He links health with the ability to comprehend, manage and apply meaning to stress. This ability is called a Sense of Coherence. The higher the sense of coherence, the less negative the impact of stress will have on mental and physical health. It has also been shown that residents in low-income housing are often confronted with multiple social, physical, emotional and financial stressors, which can further weaken their sense of coherence. In this regard, low-income residents share a similarity with the hospital patients documented in many studies of salutogenics in healthcare, in that they face an abnormally high amount of stress and may be in situations that have weakened their sense of coherence.
	In the 1990s architect Alan Dilani suggested that Antonovsky’s salutogenic principles be applied to the architectural design of healthcare facilities as a means to promote health. More recently, this design model has also been applied to long-term care facilities and workplaces, however it has not yet been applied to low-income housing. Although the presence of stress is not solely due to architecture, architecture and design can either intensify or mitigate the effects of stress on health. Countless studies show a relationship between the design of our built environment and health. For example, there is a direct link between access to natural light and blood pressure, between over-crowding or chronic noise and psychological stress and between healing and nature. With over 8\% of the Canadian population living in low-income housing and 3.3 million households paying more than what is considered affordable on rent ({\textgreater}30\% of their income), addressing the health impact of low-income housing design is critical.},

A simple yet effective method for mapping daily weather conditions across heterogeneous landscapes is described and assessed. Daily weather data recorded at point locations are integrated with long-term-average climate maps to reconstruct spatially explicit estimates of daily precipitation and temperature extrema. The method uses ordinary kriging to interpolate base station data spatially into fields of approximately 2-km grain size. The fields are subsequently adjusted by 30-yr-average climate maps [Parameter-Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM)], which incorporate adiabatic lapse rates, orographic effects, coastal proximity, and other environmental factors. The accuracy assessment evaluated an interpolation-only approach and the new method by comparing predicted and observed values from an independent validation dataset. The results of the accuracy assessment are compared for a 24-yr period for California. For all three weather variables, mean absolute errors (MAE) of the climate-imprint method were considerably smaller than those of the interpolation-only approach. MAE for predicted daily precipitation was ±2.5 mm, with a bias of +0.01. MAE for predicted daily minimum and maximum temperatures were ±1.7° and ±2.0°C, respectively, with corresponding biases of −0.41° and −0.38°C. MAE differed seasonally for all three weather variables, but the method was stable despite variation in the number of base stations available for each day.},

	abstract = {Knowledge from high-resolution daily climatological parameters is frequently sought after for increasingly local climate change assessments. This research investigates whether applying a simple postprocessing methodology to existing statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation fields can result in improved downscaled simulations useful at the local scale. Initial downscaled daily simulations of temperature and precipitation at 10-km resolution are produced using bias correction constructed analogs with quantile mapping (BCCAQ). Higher-resolution (800 m) values are then generated using the simpler climate imprint technique in conjunction with temperature and precipitation climatologies from the Parameter-Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). The potential benefit of additional downscaling to 800 m is evaluated using the “Climdex” set of 27 indices of extremes established by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). These indices are also calculated from weather station observations recorded at 22 locations within southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to evaluate the performance of both the 10-km and 800-m datasets in replicating the observed quantities. In a 30-yr historical evaluation period, Climdex indices computed from 800-m simulated values display reduced error relative to local station observations than those from the 10-km dataset, with the greatest reduction in error occurring at high-elevation sites for precipitation-based indices.},

This study proposed a GIS-based approach to combine climate modeling, building energy simulation, and inventory of building characteristics to quantify climate change's effect on building energy demand in Los Angeles, California. The impact was assessed by comparing building energy demands under current and future climate conditions through two metrics: relative change (RC) and absolute difference (AD), in annual, monthly, and diurnal scales under A1F1 and A2 emission scenarios. A spatial analysis was performed to assess neighborhoods vulnerable to climate change. Results suggest that most building types showed an apparent increase of energy demands under both scenarios. The increase of cooling energy demand resulted in great changes in RC and AD. Larger changes were observed at finer time scales. The energy demand for buildings increased from April to October, but decreased from November to March. The largest positive AD of total energy for all building types occurred in August, ranging 1.8–30.9 MJ/sqm, but the characteristics of diurnal AD varied with building types. Areas with dense tall commercial buildings would foresee the largest increase in energy demand. Our approach can foresee the sensitivity of building energy demands at different spatio-temporal scales.},

	abstract = {The Urban Weather Generator (UWG) is a simple and computationally efficient model that predicts canopy level urban air temperature using meteorological information measured at a reference weather station. An evaluation of an improved version of the model, which accounts for different urban morphologies and building usage distributions within a city, is presented in this paper. Calculated urban air temperatures are compared with measurements from a network of weather stations in Singapore, representing a range of land uses, morphological parameters and building usages. The comparison shows a satisfactorily performance of the model for all weather conditions and for different reference weather stations. Singapore is located in a hot and humid climate where vegetation plays a critical role in climate regulation, the urban morphology is very heterogeneous and air-conditioning systems are generally used throughout the year. This makes Singapore an interesting case study in order to analyse the potential and limitations of the model. The study shows that the model can be applied to different climates and urban configurations to obtain an estimation of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. However, the simplifications and assumptions of the model prevent it from capturing very site-specific microclimate effects.},

This paper presents an urban weather generator (UWG) to calculate air temperatures inside urban canyons from measurements at an operational weather station located in an open area outside a city.

	abstract = {It is well known that local urban heat island (UHI) effects impact the urban environment from a public health standpoint and with regards to heating and cooling energy used by buildings. Unfortunately, neither urban planners and designers nor energy consultants currently have quantitative tools or methods at their disposal to incorporate this effect into the design of a neighborhood. This manuscript demonstrates the application of the earlier reported Urban Weather Generator (UWG) model (Bueno et al., 2012a, 2014) as a design tool to provide climatespecific advice for cityscape geometry and land use. UWG estimates local hourly urban canopy air temperature and humidity profiles from measurements at a nearby weather station based on neighborhoodscale energy balances. The morphed temperature output can be used to study the effect of localized UHI on building energy use profiles. To accomplish this, UWG was combined with a parametric simulation module that works either stand-alone or through the urban modeling interface (umi) (Reinhart et al., 2013) in Rhinoceros 3D. The newly proposed workflow is demonstrated through a case study of the MIT East Campus development in Cambridge, MA, USA, that includes the addition of 130,000 m2 of laboratory space and residences to an existing urban condition. IPCC climate change predictions (Nakicenovic \& Swart, 2000) are coupled with UHI to capture local and global heating on the site to promote thermally comfortable and energy-efficient development at each planning phase.},

	abstract = {The realistic representation of rainfall on the local scale in climate models remains a key challenge. Realism encompasses the full spatial and temporal structure of rainfall, and is a key indicator of model skill in representing the underlying processes. In particular, if rainfall is more realistic in a climate model, there is greater confidence in its projections of future change.In this study, the realism of rainfall in a very high-resolution (1.5 km) regional climate model (RCM) is compared to a coarser-resolution 12-km RCM. This is the first time a convection-permitting model has been run for an extended period (1989–2008) over a region of the United Kingdom, allowing the characteristics of rainfall to be evaluated in a climatological sense. In particular, the duration and spatial extent of hourly rainfall across the southern United Kingdom is examined, with a key focus on heavy rainfall.Rainfall in the 1.5-km RCM is found to be much more realistic than in the 12-km RCM. In the 12-km RCM, heavy rain events are not heavy enough, and tend to be too persistent and widespread. While the 1.5-km model does have a tendency for heavy rain to be too intense, it still gives a much better representation of its duration and spatial extent. Long-standing problems in climate models, such as the tendency for too much persistent light rain and errors in the diurnal cycle, are also considerably reduced in the 1.5-km RCM. Biases in the 12-km RCM appear to be linked to deficiencies in the representation of convection.},

	abstract = {Quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artiﬁcially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modiﬁcation of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quantities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algorithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inﬂate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremes with respect to the raw GCM, often substantially, as compared to DQM and especially QDM. The degree of corruption in the GCM trends by QM is particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of 1500\% with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, with maximum changes by DQM and QDM nearing 1240\% and 1140\%, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed 1120\%.},

	abstract = {Knowledge from high-resolution daily climatological parameters is frequently sought after for increasingly local climate change assessments. This research investigates whether applying a simple postprocessing methodology to existing statistically downscaled temperature and precipitation ﬁelds can result in improved downscaled simulations useful at the local scale. Initial downscaled daily simulations of temperature and precipitation at 10-km resolution are produced using bias correction constructed analogs with quantile mapping (BCCAQ). Higher-resolution (800 m) values are then generated using the simpler climate imprint technique in conjunction with temperature and precipitation climatologies from the Parameter-Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). The potential beneﬁt of additional downscaling to 800 m is evaluated using the ‘‘Climdex’’ set of 27 indices of extremes established by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). These indices are also calculated from weather station observations recorded at 22 locations within southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to evaluate the performance of both the 10-km and 800-m datasets in replicating the observed quantities. In a 30-yr historical evaluation period, Climdex indices computed from 800-m simulated values display reduced error relative to local station observations than those from the 10-km dataset, with the greatest reduction in error occurring at highelevation sites for precipitation-based indices.},

	abstract = {Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are able to simulate small-scale processes that are missing in their coarser resolution driving data and thereby provide valuable climate information for climate impact assessments. Less attention has been paid to the ability of RCMs to capture large-scale weather types (WTs). An inaccurate representation of WTs can result in biases and uncertainties in current and future climate simulations that cannot be easily detected by standard model evaluation metrics. Here we define 12 hydrologically important WTs in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). We test if RCMs from the North American CORDEX (NA-CORDEX) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model large physics ensembles (WRF36) can capture those WTs in the current climate and how they simulate changes in the future. Our results show that the NA-CORDEX RCMs are able to simulate WTs more accurately than members of the WRF36 ensemble. The much larger WRF36 domain in combination with not constraining large-scale conditions by spectral nudging results in lower WT skill. The selection of the driving global climate model (GCM) has a large effect on the skill of NA-CORDEX simulations but a smaller impact on the WRF36 runs. The formulation of the RCM is of minor importance except for capturing the variability within WTs. Changing the model physics or increasing the RCM horizontal grid spacing has little effect. These results highlight the importance of selecting GCMs with accurate synoptic-scale variability for downscaling and to find a balance between large domains that can result in biased WT representations and small domains that inhibit the realistic development of mesoscale processes. At the end of the century, monsoonal flow conditions increase systematically by up to 30 \% and a WT that is a significant source of moisture for the Northern Plains during the growing seasons decreases systematically up to -30 \%.},

	abstract = {Patterns of future climate and expected extreme conditions are pushing design limits as recognition of climate change and its implication for the built environment increases. There are a number of ways of estimating future climate projections and creating weather files. Obtaining adequate representation of long-term patterns of climate change and extreme conditions is, however, challenging. This work aims at answering two research questions: does a method of generating future weather files for building performance simulation bring advantages that cannot be provided by other methods? And what type of future weather files enable building engineers and designers to more credibly test robustness of their designs against climate change? To answer these two questions, the work provides an overview of the major approaches to create future weather data sets based on the statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate models. A number of weather data sets for Geneva were synthesized and applied to the energy simulation of 16 ASHRAE standard reference buildings, single buildings and their combination to create a virtual neighborhood. Representative weather files are synthesized to account for extreme conditions together with typical climate conditions and investigate their importance in the energy performance of buildings. According to the results, all the methods provide enough information to study the long-term impacts of climate change on average. However, the results also revealed that assessing the energy robustness of buildings only under typical future conditions is not sufficient. Depending on the type of building, the relative change of peak load for cooling demand under near future extreme conditions can still be up to 28.5\% higher compared to typical conditions. It is concluded that only those weather files generated based on dynamical downscaling and that take into consideration both typical and extreme conditions are the most reliable for providing representative boundary conditions to test the energy robustness of buildings under future climate uncertainties. The results for the neighborhood explaining the critical situation that an energy network may face due to increased peak load under extreme climatic conditions. Such critical situations remain unforeseeable by relying solely on typical and observed extreme conditions, putting the climate resilience of buildings and energy systems at risk.},

Recently, there have been major attempts to design the overall form of these buildings based on optimization approaches. This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization framework based on Genetic Algorithm, namely Energy Efficient Form-finder (EEF), consisting four main steps of Form-Generation, Form-Simulation, Form-Optimization and Form-Solutions. The EEF with a comprehensive design-based approach is evaluated through five functions considering objectives of minimizing cooling and heating demand and thermal discomfort time while maintaining operative temperature on the defined thermal comfort zone. This work studies the form combination of five reference buildings based on a new technique called “Building Modular Cell” in five different urban areas, resulting in twenty-five distinct design problems. According to the results, there is a great potential to adopt EEF in newly-built projects with a rectangular layout; while it can reduce the annual energy demand and thermal discomfort time of the optimal form combinations around 34\% and 12\% respectively. Finally, a series of qualitative and quantitative design-aid recommendations are presented based on 1998 best design solutions, which can be used as form-finding rules of thumb by architects and urban designers at the early design stages.},

	abstract = {Patterns of future climate and expected extreme conditions are pushing design limits as recognition of climate change and its implication for the built environment increases. There are a number of ways of estimating future climate projections and creating weather files. Obtaining adequate representation of long-term patterns of climate change and extreme conditions is, however, challenging. This work aims at answering two research questions: does a method of generating future weather files for building performance simulation bring advantages that cannot be provided by other methods? And what type of future weather files enable building engineers and designers to more credibly test robustness of their designs against climate change? To answer these two questions, the work provides an overview of the major approaches to create future weather data sets based on the statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate models. A number of weather data sets for Geneva were synthesized and applied to the energy simulation of 16 ASHRAE standard reference buildings, single buildings and their combination to create a virtual neighborhood. Representative weather files are synthesized to account for extreme conditions together with typical climate conditions and investigate their importance in the energy performance of buildings. According to the results, all the methods provide enough information to study the long-term impacts of climate change on average. However, the results also revealed that assessing the energy robustness of buildings only under typical future conditions is not sufficient. Depending on the type of building, the relative change of peak load for cooling demand under near future extreme conditions can still be up to 28.5\% higher compared to typical conditions. It is concluded that only those weather files generated based on dynamical downscaling and that take into consideration both typical and extreme conditions are the most reliable for providing representative boundary conditions to test the energy robustness of buildings under future climate uncertainties. The results for the neighborhood explaining the critical situation that an energy network may face due to increased peak load under extreme climatic conditions. Such critical situations remain unforeseeable by relying solely on typical and observed extreme conditions, putting the climate resilience of buildings and energy systems at risk.},

Data from several different climate models will be fused with regards to mean air temperature, wind speed and horizontal solar radiation. Several climatic models data were analysed ranging from January 2006 to December 2100. Rather than considering each model in isolation, we propose a data fusion approach for providing a robust combined model for morphing an existing weather data file. The final aim is simulating future energy use for heating and cooling of a reference building as a consequence of the expected climate changes. We compare results, in terms of robustness to overfitting, for two different fusion methodologies, based on the comparison between errors on punctual historical data or prediction models that can be obtained by each climate simulator and by the actual ERA-INTERIM data set. Finally, we map the new aggregated data into a prediction trace of heating and cooling energy requirements. The expected energy demand is in the range of the one provided by single climate models, with a variability that reaches up to the 10\% of the overall energy requirements. The approach proposed is an advancement as it allows to achieve better fits with existing re-analysis data if compared to specific global circulation models output data. Thus a more reliable estimation of energy use for heating and cooling can be achieved.},

	abstract = {Higher availability of future climate data sets, generated by regional climate models (RCMs) with fine temporal and spatial resolutions, improves and facilitates the impact assessment of climate change. Due to significant uncertainties in climate modeling, several climate scenarios should be considered in the impact assessment. This increases the number of simulations and size of data sets, complicating the assessment and decision making. This article suggests an easy-to-use method to decrease the number of simulations for the impact assessment of climate change in energy and building studies. The method is based on synthesizing three sets of weather data out of one or more RCMs: one typical and two extremes. The method aims at decreasing the number of weather data sets without losing the quality and details of the original future climate scenarios. The application of the method is assessed for an office building in Geneva and the residential building stock in Stockholm. Results show that using the synthesized data sets provides an accurate estimation of future conditions. Variations and uncertainties of future climate are represented by the synthesized data. In the case of synthesizing weather data using multiple climate scenarios, the number of simulations and the size of data sets are decreased enormously. Combining the typical and extreme data sets enables to have better probability distributions of future conditions, very similar to the original RCM data.},

	abstract = {As buildings have a relatively long life span, it is important to consider climate change in energy performance modelling. Good quality weather data are needed to obtain accurate results. This chapter discusses widely used methods to predict future weather data (dynamical downscaling, stochastic weather generators and morphing) and provides an overview of available weather datasets (multi-year, typical years, extreme years and representative years) for building simulations. A Flemish office building is used for a comparative analysis of the estimated heating and cooling load making use of 1-year weather files (typical and extreme future climate conditions) derived from a recently developed convection-permitting climate model for Belgium. Climate models and weather generators are identified as the most preferred for the estimation of the average energy consumption and thermal comfort in average and extreme situations. Climate models have the advantage to better represent extreme weather events and climate differences due to territorial settings, while weather generators can generate multiple climate realizations. A combination of a typical year with an extreme cold and extreme warm year was found to result in an overall good representation of the energy need for heating and cooling in average and extreme weather conditions. Further, the influence of the methodological choices to extract 1-year weather files (typical or extreme years) from the 30-year climate data is highlighted as different results were obtained when different meteorological variables were considered for the creation of the 1-year files.},

This paper introduces a new location-specific mortality risk focused definition of heat waves and a new mathematical framework for the creation of time series that represents them. It focuses on identifying periods when temperatures are high during the day and night, as this coincidence is strongly linked to mortality. The approach is tested using observed data from Brazil and the UK. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate that this new approach represents a major advance that can be adopted worldwide by governments, researchers and industry.},

	abstract = {Building heat demand is responsible for a significant share of the total global final energy consumption. Building stock models with a high spatio-temporal resolution are a powerful tool to investigate the effects of new building policies aimed at increasing energy efficiency, the introduction of new heating technologies or the integration of buildings within an energy system based on renewable energy sources. Therefore, building stock models have to be able to model the improvements and variation of used materials in buildings. In this paper, we propose a method based on generalized large-scale geographic information system (GIS) to model building heat demand of large regions with a high temporal resolution. In contrast to existing building stock models, our approach allows to derive the envelope of all buildings from digital elevation models and to model location dependent effects such as shadowing due to the topography and climate conditions. We integrate spatio-temporal climate data for temperature and solar radiation to model climate effects of complex terrain. The model is validated against a database containing the measured energy demand of 1845 buildings of the city of St. Gallen, Switzerland and 120 buildings of the Alpine village of Zernez, Switzerland. The proposed model is able to assess and investigate large regions by using spatial data describing natural and anthropogenic land features. The validation resulted in an average goodness of fit (R2) of 0.6.},

In this work, we investigated to which extent the uncertainty in the determination of typical weather conditions can affect the results of building energy refurbishment when cost-optimal approach is implemented for the selection of energy efficiency measures by means of the NSGA-II genetic algorithm coupled with TRNSYS simulations. Six different reference years were determined for two north Italy climates, Trento and Monza, respectively in the Alpine and in the continental temperate regions. Four types of energy efficiency measures, related to both building envelope and HVAC system, were applied to six existing building typologies. Results showed how the choice of reference year can alter the shape of the Pareto fronts, the number of solutions included and the selection among the alternatives of the energy efficiency measures, for the entire front and, in particular, for energy and economic optima.},

However, climate change weather data suitable for buildings performance simulation are typically unavailable. This research presents a method to integrate climate change features into historical weather data to make suitable climate change weather data available for buildings performance simulation. The method separates hourly dry bulb temperature into three time series components to simplify the integration of three climate change features. The method adjusts the maximum and minimum monthly averages, the number of days with maximum temperature above a specified threshold, and the number of consecutive occurrences of days with maximum temperature above a specified threshold (heatwave). The research also presents the adjustment of monthly averages of global solar irradiation. Under the climate–changed weather conditions, the annual heating thermal energy decreases by 21\%–22\%, the annual cooling thermal energy increases by 29\%–31\%, and the combined heating and cooling thermal energy decreases by 4\%–5\% compared to the heating and cooling thermal energy under the current weather conditions. The results indicate that climate–changed weather data is necessary as historical weather data is insufficient for accurately assessing the energy performance of a building.},

	abstract = {The building sector is one of the most relevant sectors in terms of generation of wealth and occupation, but it is also one of the main contributor to energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. at the European level it is currently responsible for 36\% of CO2 emissions). For these reason this sector must play a key role in achieving a low-carbon economy consistent with the objective of holding the increase of the average temperature of the globe below 2 °C if compared to pre-industrial levels. In this context, the paper analyses the potential impact of climate change on the energy uses for heating and cooling in southern Europe, based on the assumptions of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) future climate projections (assessment report 5). Different General Circulation Models (GCMs) were analysed using different metrics for selecting the most suitable one to be applied to building simulation. GCM data were used as input to a downscaling method known as “morphing”, to generate hourly weather files for 3 future time projections (2035, 2065 and 2090). Finally, in order to assess the building energy use for heating and cooling for the next century, energy simulations for a case study were performed. The results show, in all scenarios, consistent and large increases in future air temperature. The impacts of these driving forces on heating and cooling energy use are very relevant: the results show an overall increase in total energy consumption with a relative decrease in heating demand and increase in cooling demand: the yearly heating and cooling energy requirement in 2090 is expected to increase in a range of +50.8–119.7\% if measures are not foreseen to counter and limit the effects of climate change.},

Current practice focuses on computing summary measures, such as mean and variance, or constructing a reference year from small subsets of data derived from multiple years. Some applications require the selection of an instance of observed data over a fixed time frame, typically a year or more, for modeling. In addition, many current methods do not include rainfall as a parameter of interest. This paper reviews and refines existing methods for determining a reference year by creating a metric that measures the (abstract) distance between observed patterns of rainfall. The reference year is then chosen from a group of potential reference years. This method is computationally efficient, easily explained, and robust against differences in the index of reporting, to include leap years. Application of the distance metric to data from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk, Virginia, shows that it appropriately identifies not only the years that are most typical for a location, but extreme years as well. Both are particularly useful in applications related to urban hydrology, which formed the basis for development of this method. Results also demonstrate that the proposed method is functionally different than existing methods. The distance metric represents an evolutionary step forward, overcomes some difficulties present from other approaches, and would be applicable to a number of cross-disciplinary applications.},

This paper develops a generalizable methodology to estimate the energy saving potential for heating/cooling in 20 cities in two Chinese provinces, representing cold winter and hot summer regions respectively. We also conduct a life-cycle analysis of the new infrastructure required for energy exchange in DES. Results show that heating and cooling energy use reduction from this waste heat exchange strategy varies widely based on the mix of industrial, residential and commercial activities, and climate conditions in cities. Low-grade heat is found to be the dominant component of waste heat released by industries, which can be reused for both district heating and cooling in fourth generation DES, yielding energy use reductions from 12\%–91\% (average of 58\%) for heating and 24\%–100\% (average of 73\%) for cooling energy use in the different cities based on annual exchange potential. Incorporating seasonality and multiple energy exchange pathways resulted in energy savings reductions from 0\%–87\%. The life-cycle impact of added infrastructure was small ({\textless}3\% for heating) and 1.9\% ∼ 6.5\% (cooling) of the carbon emissions from fuel use in current heating or cooling systems, indicating net carbon savings. This generalizable approach to delineate waste heat potential can help determine suitable cities for the widespread application of industrial waste heat re-utilization.},

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&amp;ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&amp;ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \&amp;ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Buildings are generally modelled for compliance using reference weather years. In the UK these are the test reference year (TRY) used for energy analysis and the design summer year (DSY) used for assessing overheating in the summer. These reference years currently exist for 14 locations around the UK and consist of either a composite year compiled of the most average months from 23 years worth of observed weather data (TRY) or a single contiguous year representing a hot but non-extreme summer (DSY). In this paper, we compare simulations run using the reference years and the results obtained from simulations using the base data sets from which these reference years were chosen. We compare the posterior statistic to the reference year for several buildings examining energy use, internal temperatures, overheating and thermal comfort. We find that while the reference years allow rapid thermal modelling of building designs they are not always representative of the average energy use (TRY) exposed by modelling with many weather years. Also they do not always give an accurate indication of the internal conditions within a building and as such can give a misleading representation of the risk of overheating (DSY). Practical applications: An understanding of the limitations of the current reference years is required to allow creation of updated reference years for building simulation of future buildings. By comparing the reference years to the base data sets of historical data from which they were compiled an understanding of the benefit of multiple simulations in determining risk can be obtained.

We undertake a critical analysis of the fundamental issues and limitations of each methodology and discusses new challenges, such as how to deal with uncertainty, the urban heat island, climate change and extreme events. Proposals for the next generation of weather files for building simulation are made based on this analysis. A seven-point list of requirements for weather files is introduced and the state-of-the-art compared to this via a mapping exercise. It is found that there are various issues with all current and suggested approaches, but the two areas most requiring attention are the production of weather files for the urban landscape and files specifically designed to test buildings against the criteria of morbidity, mortality and building services system failure.},

	abstract = {Building engineers commonly use the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather data for simulation and design purposes. However, the nature of TMY in excluding weather extremes makes them less suitable to investigate the effect of potential climate change on building design as climate change likely increases the frequency and magnitude of those extreme conditions. The current practice of designing buildings has lacked a clear method to incorporate future climate change trends. An approach is used to compare present weather simulation results of a commercial building with varying roof reflectance and insulation thermal resistance parameters with future year-by-year results which are affected by potential climate change. Future weather data for year-by-year simulations is obtained by “morphing” historical weather data with a General Circulation Model (HadCM3). Mean energy consumption and optimal roof configurations are discussed with regards to climate change over the study period, and are compared to results obtained with TMY data. Results show that increased roof solar reflectance always lead to less mean and less variant cooling energy consumption. The study shows the importance of considering possible future climate scenarios and in building energy performance design.},

	abstract = {Energy simulations are often used to evaluate the indoor thermal environment and energy consumption of buildings. In such simulations, it is common to use regional weather data that are typically based on current or past weather conditions. However, most buildings have a lifespan of several decades, during which climate can change gradually. Therefore, the design of energy conservation systems and energy simulations should incorporate climate change predictions to ensure that buildings are adaptable to future climatic conditions. The present study aims to construct future (i.e., 2030s) standard weather data for use in architectural design using numerical meteorological models. For this purpose, we adopted a dynamical downscaling method, used global climate model (GCM) data as the initial and boundary conditions for input into a regional climate model (RCM), and physically downscaled the data using the RCM. We constructed a prototype of the future (i.e., 2031–2035) standard weather data based on version 4 of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The results confirm that the weather data generated via the dynamical downscaling method can predict local climate. Subsequently, we simulated building thermal load consumption using regional climate data. By comparing the results for the present (2007) and future (2034), we estimated the impact of climate change on the energy performance of a detached house. In particular, the sensible heat load for the house was predicted to increase by 15\% under the conditions considered.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the need of future climate information at local scales have pushed the climate modelling community to perform increasingly higher resolution simulations and to develop alternative approaches to obtain fine-scale climatic information. In this article, various nested regional climate model (RCM) simulations have been used to try to identify regions across North America where high-resolution downscaling generates fine-scale details in the climate projection derived using the "delta method". Two necessary conditions were identified for an RCM to produce added value (AV) over lower resolution atmosphere-ocean general circulation models in the fine-scale component of the climate change (CC) signal. First, the RCM-derived CC signal must contain some non-negligible fine-scale information--independently of the RCM ability to produce AV in the present climate. Second, the uncertainty related with the estimation of this fine-scale information should be relatively small compared with the information itself in order to suggest that RCMs are able to simulate robust fine-scale features in the CC signal. Clearly, considering necessary (but not sufficient) conditions means that we are studying the "potential" of RCMs to add value instead of the AV, which preempts and avoids any discussion of the actual skill and hence the need for hindcast comparisons. The analysis concentrates on the CC signal obtained from the seasonal-averaged temperature and precipitation fields and shows that the fine-scale variability of the CC signal is generally small compared to its large-scale component, suggesting that little AV can be expected for the time-averaged fields. For the temperature variable, the largest potential for fine-scale added value appears in coastal regions mainly related with differential warming in land and oceanic surfaces. Fine-scale features can account for nearly 60 \% of the total CC signal in some coastal regions although for most regions the fine scale contributions to the total CC signal are of around 5 \%. For the precipitation variable, fine scales contribute to a change of generally less than 15 \% of the seasonal-averaged precipitation in present climate with a continental North American average of 5 \% in both summer and winter seasons. In the case of precipitation, uncertainty due to sampling issues may further dilute the information present in the downscaled fine scales. These results suggest that users of RCM simulations for climate change studies in a delta method framework have little high-resolution information to gain from RCMs at least if they limit themselves to the study of first-order statistical moments. Other possible benefits arising from the use of RCMs--such as in the large scale of the downscaled fields- were not explored in this research.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {The importance of understanding and promoting pro-environmental behaviour among individual consumers in modern Western Societies is generally accepted. Attitudes and attitude change are often examined to help reach this goal. But although attitudes are relatively good predictors of behaviour and are relatively easy to change they only help explain specific behaviours. More stable individual factors such as values and identities may affect a wider range of behaviours. In particular factors which are important to the self are likely to influence behaviour across contexts and situations. This paper examines the role of values and identities in explaining individual pro-environmental behaviours. Secondary analyses were conducted on data from three studies on UK residents, with a total of 2694 participants. Values and identities were good predictors of pro-environmental behaviour in each study and identities explain pro-environmental behaviours over and above specific attitudes. The link between values and behaviours was fully mediated by identities in two studies and partially mediated in one study supporting the idea that identities may be broader concepts which incorporate values. The findings lend support for the concept of identity campaigning to promote sustainable behaviour. Moreover, it suggests fruitful future research directions which should explore the development and maintenance of identities.},

We examined what higher order motives, other than morality, may be important for understanding pro-environmental behavior, by studying consumer identities. In three studies (N = 877) four consumer identities were distinguished: moral, wasteful, frugal, and thrifty. Frugal and moral consumer identities were most salient and were the strongest predictors of pro-environmental behaviors, but in different ways. Frugality, which is related to, but distinct from thriftiness, was particularly important for behaviors associated with waste reduction of any kind (including money). The findings suggest that people adopt the same behavior for different reasons, in ways consistent with their consumer identities. People manage multiple consumer identities simultaneously, and environmental policy is likely to be more effective if it addresses these multiple identities.},

The Sustainable Post-Occupancy Evaluation Survey, a self-administered and online-based questionnaire was used. The results indicated that male occupants have a greater tendency to be satisfied with thermal conditions, acoustic conditions, electric lighting, and privacy than female occupants. The middle age group (35–54yearrs) was less satisfied with the IEQs than the younger (18–34years) and older (+55years) groups. In addition, occupants who had worked less than 2 years were more satisfied with most IEQ factors than occupants who had worked more than 2 years.

	abstract = {Ability to model the probability of individual house sales would be of benefit in a number of real estate contexts. Existing housing literature models the probability of a house sale using mainly property characteristics or macroeconomic variables. However, the use of only property characteristics typically yields a poor model fit. This study investigates the relative roles of property characteristics, seller mortgage origination variables, and locational factors in terms of explaining the probability of individual house sales. Homeowner information such as their time horizon of staying in the house and their stage in the life cycle should have an important impact on house sale decisions. Although obtaining such information is typically difficult, mortgage choices made at loan origination may help reveal such information. In addition, the measurable characteristics of neighbors and the geographic clustering of house sales, ceteris paribus, may aid in modeling house sales. Incorporating the property characteristics, mortgage origination variables, and locational factors increases the pseudo-R2 of a probit model from under 1 percent when only using property characteristics to over 23 percent when using property, mortgage, and spatial information. The results are consistent through a particularly large housing cycle in both Las Vegas County in Nevada and Maricopa County in Arizona from 2006 to 2010, and for a variety of sub samples.},

	abstract = {Buying or selling a house is one of the important decisions in a person's life. Online listing websites like "zillow.com", "trulia.com", and "realtor.com" etc. provide significant and effective assistance during the buy/sell process. However, they fail to supply one important information of a house that is, approximately how long will it take for a house to be sold after it first appears in the listing? This information is equally important for both a potential buyer and the seller. With this information the seller will have an understanding of what she can do to expedite the sale, i.e. reduce the asking price, renovate/remodel some home features, etc. On the other hand, a potential buyer will have an idea of the available time for her to react i.e. to place an offer. In this work, we propose a supervised regression (Cox regression) model inspired by survival analysis to predict the sale probability of a house given historical home sale information within an observation time window. We use real-life housing data collected from "trulia.com" to validate the proposed prediction algorithm and show its superior performance over traditional regression methods. We also show how the sale probability of a house is influenced by the values of basic house features, such as price, size, \# of bedrooms, \# of bathrooms, and school quality.},

The federal funds rate generally has directional predictability for existing (newly built) home sales in 1984–2005 (1972–1983). The term spread has directional predictability for home sales in 1972–1983 but generally not in the tranquil period of 1984–2005.

In particular, we attempt to determine (1) whether competition can be induced among prospective sellers, (2) whether or not competition increases aggregation rates, and (3) what effects competition has on the distribution of surplus among the bargaining parties. We also study the incidence with which a buyer (endogenously) chooses to deal with a single “large parcel” owner vs. multiple “small parcel” owners. To do so, we make use of a laboratory experiment where all the relevant information about the project is common knowledge and landowner valuations are private information. Our results show that competition more than doubles aggregation rates, with aggregation rates of approximately 40\% in the baseline, and at least 84\% in the competitive treatments. We also find that developers have a strong preference to make transactions with landowners who have consolidated land holdings, doing so in 24/27 successful aggregations, providing empirical evidence that there is a link between the transactions cost associated with land-assembly and suburbanization, as suggested by Miceli and Sirmans (2007).},

	abstract = {The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Kelo v. New London allows the use of eminent domain to facilitate private economic development. While the court’s condition for allowing takings was highly expansive, there may be a market failure that warrants state intervention when parcels of land need to be combined for redevelopment. The collective action or strategic holdout problem associated with land assembly may limit redevelopment of older communities when one or more existing owners seek to capture a disproportionate share of the potential surplus. The problem may be compounded by landowners’ uncertainty as to the true value of the expected surplus to be divided (Eckart, 1985; Strange, 1995). At the same time, developers may attempt to disguise the assemblage through the use of straw purchasers. This paper employs administrative Geographic Information System and assessor data from Seattle, Washington, to identify lots that were ultimately assembled. The paper then matches them to their pre-assembly sales. Controlling for lot and existing structure characteristics and census tract-year fixed effects, I find that land bought in the process of a successful assembly commands an 18 percent premium. Consistent with theory, this premium falls with a parcel’s relative size in the assemblage. I also find some evidence that parcels toward the center of the development may command a larger premium than those at the edge, suggesting that developers retain or are perceived to retain some design flexibility.},

The cases demonstrate how decisions can be understood as embedded in the practice of dwelling, and how a readiness for decisions regarding retrofitting is created, or not, in this practice. We suggest shifting focus from the outcome of decisions, to attention toward the process that leads to readiness for making the decision in the first place.},

However, it is still to determine the public's acceptance of innovations of the traditional solar PV architecture. Building applied photovoltaic technology (BAPV) is a technological innovation that can be installed over existing building surfaces. This study compares an evaluation of the conscious and subconscious attitudinal, control and normative beliefs of American homeowners when randomly primed with two brochures depicting the purchasing, installation, and commissioning of solar PV systems, developed according to the characteristics of conventional and an adhesive “plug and play” BAPV system. The survey instrument (N = 400 survey participants) was designed in consonance to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). When comparing the direct measures for each solar PV technology, no significant differences were found. This may indicate that for those unfamiliar with PV technology, placing an adhesive backing module on the roof is standard procedure and does not impact purchasing intentions. The evaluation further showed that unlike the subconscious control beliefs, social norms and attitudes have a significant impact on forming intentions to adopt solar PV. The implications of these findings for strategy, policy and future research are explored.},

	abstract = {A greater appreciation of architecture as a means to drive social, economic and environmental sustainability is emerging around the world. Practices are beginning to adopt closed-loop and cradle-to-cradle strategies, and some are even aiming toward net-positive design. However, life cycle assessment (LCA) tools do not measure ‘beyond zero’. The question of how net-positive carbon sequestration (i.e. impacts beyond net-zero) can be assessed within LCA is explored through a proposed carbon amortization performance (CAP) method. CAP overlays energy-related carbon and biomass sequestration over the building life cycle. CO2 equivalence (CO2e) is used to combine both positive and negative impacts from different sources. Net-positive contributions are deﬁned as those exceeding ‘zero operational carbon’ –after the embodied carbon is paid back during the life cycle. The CAP method was tested on a building design with the technical support of multidisciplinary experts. The results indicate that a building can sequester more carbon over its life cycle than it emits by using on-site current renewable energy technology and extensive building-integrated vegetation. Buildings designed on net-positive development principles can potentially reverse their carbon impact and begin to regenerate their regions, while providing multiple eco-services.},

The main structural materials of the buildings include precast concrete, cross laminated timber (CLT) and prefabricated timber modules (modular). The analysis covers energy and material ﬂows from different life cycle phases of the building versions, designed to meet the energy performance of the Swedish building code (BBR) and passive house criteria. The CLT and modular buildings were found to result in lower production primary energy use and higher biomass residues compared to the concrete alternative. The heating value of the recoverable biomass residues from the production phase of the CLT building is signiﬁcantly larger than the primary energy required for its production. Primary energy use for production and construction constitutes 20–30\% and 36–47\% of the total primary energy use for production, construction, space heating, ventilation and demolition for the BBR and passive buildings, respectively. Space heating with combined heat and power (CHP) and ventilation electricity for the BBR and passive building versions form 70–79\% and 52–63\%, respectively, of the total primary energy use for production, construction, space heating, ventilation and demolition for a lifespan of 80 years. The CLT and modular buildings give 20–37\% and 9–17\% lower total life cycle primary energy use, respectively, than the concrete alternative when space heating is from CHP.},

To address the spatial uncertainty and temporal randomness in land use change, we propose a model for simulating land use change based on Markov chain and cellular automata (CA), and describes its application to the simulation of land use changes in the city of Wuhan, China. To simulate the urban land use change, the transition rules of the model were ﬁrst set by globally restrained conditions, locally restrained conditions and a random variable. And then land use patterns and changes were obtained from classiﬁed Landsat TM images. A spatial-temporal transition matrix was constructed from the classiﬁed images and was applied to the proposed model for simulating land use changes in the city of Wuhan.

	abstract = {Urban land-use modeling methods have experienced substantial improvements in the last several decades. With the advancement of urban land-use change theories and modeling techniques, a considerable number of models have been developed. The relatively young approach, agent-based modeling, provides urban land-use models with some new features and can help address the challenges faced by traditional models. Applications of agent-based models to study urban dynamics have increased steadily over the last twenty years. To offer a retrospective on the developments in agent-based models (ABMs) of urban residential choices, we review fifty-one relevant models that fall into three general categories: (i) urban land-use models based on classical theories; (ii) different stages of the urbanization process; and (iii) integrated agent-based and microsimulation models. We summarize and compare the main features of these fiftyone models within each category. This review focuses on three fundamental new features introduced byABMs. The first is agent heterogeneity with particular attention to the method of introducing heterogeneity in agents’ attributes and behaviors. The second is the representation of land-market processes, namely preferences, resources constraints, competitive bidding, and endogenous relocation. The third is the method of measuring the extensive model outputs. In addition, we outline accompanying challenges to, and open questions for, incorporating these new features. We conclude that, by modeling agent heterogeneity and land markets, and by exploiting a much broader dimension of output, we will enhance our understanding of urban land-use change and are hopefully able to improve model fitness and robustness.},

This paper develops an agent-based RLC-REP joint model as a key component of an integrated land use-transport model, SelfSim. RLC-REP is capable of simultaneously simulating purchasing, renting and investing behaviour, considering the interactions and competitions between different agent types in the housing market, including renter, landlord, purchaser, seller and investor agents, resulting in new residential locations and real estate prices. In addition, the demographic evolution model in SelfSim that is directly linked to the RLC-REP model is also introduced. Next, both global and local sensitivity analyses (SAs), which employ the Elementary Effect Method (EEM) and Once-At-A-Time (OAT) Method, respectively, are carried out to fully test RLC-REP in a numerical example set up based on a Chinese medium-sized city, Baoding. The EEM-based global SAs identify four influential parameters (among the thirty-four) that could significantly influence the outputs of interests. The OAT-based local SAs further explore how these four important parameters influence the outputs, suggesting that the interactions between parameters could heavily influence the model sensitivity. Finally, the potential applications of the SA results to calibrate the model and to set up “what-if” scenarios are discussed.},

While private individuals own most undeveloped land, little is known about how their decision-making processes shape landscape-scale patterns of urbanization over time. We introduce a hybrid agent-based modeling (ABM) – cellular automata (CA) modeling approach, developed for analyzing dynamic feedbacks between landowners’ decisions to sell their land for development, and resulting patterns of landscape fragmentation. Our modeling approach builds on existing conceptual frameworks in land systems modeling by integrating an ABM into an established grid-based land-change model – FUTURES. The decision-making process within the ABM involves landowner agents whose decision to sell their land to developers is a function of heterogeneous preferences and peer-influences (i.e., spatial neighborhood relationships). Simulating landowners’ decision to sell allows an operational link between the ABM and the CA module. To test our hybrid ABM-CA approach, we used empirical data for a rapidly growing region in North Carolina for parameterization. We conducted a sensitivity analysis focusing on the two most relevant parameters—spatial actor distribution and peer-influence intensity—and evaluated the dynamic behavior of the model simulations. The simulation results indicate different peer-influence intensities lead to variable landscape fragmentation patterns, suggesting patterns of spatial interaction among landowners indirectly affect landscape-scale patterns of urbanization and the fragmentation of undeveloped forest and farmland.},

This chapter presents the ILUTE Demographic Updating Module (I-DUM), which updates the residential population demographics throughout the simulation. Given a synthetic base population, I-DUM updates the attributes of the agents at each time step. New agents are introduced through birth and in-migration, while agents exit through death and out-migration events. Unions between agents are formed through a marriage market, while a divorce model dissolves existing ones. Transitions to new households are also triggered by a move-out model. I-DUM is a closed demographic model where social networks are built and maintained throughout the simulation. Maintaining social connections brings some advantages for modeling travel behavior and location choice. I-DUM is being tested against a 20-year (1986–2006) period using a 100\% synthetic GTHA population (4.1 million persons, 1.1 million families, 1.4 million households). The results are compared against historical observations across multiple dimensions. In general, I-DUM exhibits a strong performance, and the authors have confidence that it can maintain the validity of inputs to the other behavioral models in ILUTE. I-DUM’s implementation has also been parallelized which brings significant performance improvements.},

	abstract = {Integrated urban models (IUMs) (aka, integrated transport/land-use models) have been developed and (sometimes) applied for more than 50 years, dating back to the early 1960s. IUMs have been criticized over this same period on both practical and theoretical grounds. At the same time, continuing and very significant technological developments have made possible the development, implementation and use of such models in operational planning settings in various countries worldwide. A major review of the IUM state of the art and recommendations for evolution of this state were prepared by the author and colleagues 20 years ago. This paper presents an update of the 1998 report in terms of a summary of progress over the past 20 years, a critical assessment of the current IUM state of the art and practice, and needs and prospects for future development. This paper argues that the current modeling state is in “the doldrums,” similar to concerns raised by Pas in the seminal 1990 critique of activity-based travel models. It then outlines research and development needs to exploit current and emerging data, computing, and methodological developments that hold promise for the development of a much more powerful and useful “next generation” of IUMs.},

Similar to the case of activity-based travel models, microsimulation in integrated urban models enables such models to deal better with: heterogeneity and non-linearity in behavior; identification of the detailed spatial and socioeconomic distribution of impacts, benefits and costs; tracing complex interactions across agents and over time; providing support for modelling memory, learning and adaptation among agents; computational efficiency; and emergent behavior. The paper discusses strengths, weaknesses and challenges in microsimulating urban regions, including the extent to which microsimulation models are still subject to Lee’s famous “seven sins of large-scale modelling,” as well as the extent to which they may help alleviate or reduce these sins in operational models. The paper concludes with a very brief discussion of future prospects for such models.},

This study aims to highlight the role of the homeowner in the decision-making for energy building renovation investigating his motivations, needs, attitudes and daily routines.

We compare the downscaled projections of climate change, and the associated observational data used as training data for downscaling. We map and quantify the variability among the datasets and characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of agreement and disagreement among the datasets. Pair-wise comparisons of datasets identify the coast and high-elevation areas as areas of disagreement for temperature. For precipitation, high-elevation areas, rainshadows and the dry, eastern portion of the study area have high dissimilarity among the datasets.

	abstract = {A variety of methods are available to estimate future solar radiation (SR) scenarios at spatial scales that are appropriate for local climate change impact assessment. However, there are no clear guidelines available in the literature to decide which methodologies are most suitable for different applications. Three methodologies to guide the estimation of SR are discussed in this study, namely: Case 1: SR is measured, Case 2: SR is measured but sparse and Case 3: SR is not measured. In Case 1, future SR scenarios are derived using several downscaling methodologies that transfer the simulated large-scale information of global climate models to a local scale (measurements). In Case 2, the SR was first estimated at the local scale for a longer time period using sparse measured records, and then future scenarios were derived using several downscaling methodologies. In Case 3: the SR was first estimated at a regional scale for a longer time period using complete or sparse measured records of SR from which SR at the local scale was estimated. Finally, the future scenarios were derived using several downscaling methodologies. The lack of observed SR data, especially in developing countries, has hindered various climate change impact studies. Hence, this was further elaborated by applying the Case 3 methodology to a semi-arid Malaprabha reservoir catchment in southern India. A support vector machine was used in downscaling SR. Future monthly scenarios of SR were estimated from simulations of third-generation Canadian General Circulation Model (CGCM3) for various SRES emission scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and COMMIT). Results indicated a projected decrease of 0.4 to 12.2 W m−2 yr−1 in SR during the period 2001−2100 across the 4 scenarios. SR was calculated using the modified Hargreaves method. The decreasing trends for the future were in agreement with the simulations of SR from the CGCM3 model directly obtained for the 4 scenarios.},

Fire potential is measured by the Keetch–Byram Drought Index (KBDI), which is determined by daily maximum temperature and precipitation. The impact of relative humidity and wind speed is examined by comparing KBDI with the modified Fosberg Fire Weather Index (mFFWI). The present (1971–2000) and future (2041–2070) daily regional climate conditions were obtained by dynamical downscaling of the HadCM3 global projection using HRM3 regional climate model provided by the North America Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCP). It is shown that fire potential is expected to increase in the Southwest, Rocky Mountains, northern Great Plains, Southeast, and Pacific coast, mainly caused by future warming trends. Most pronounced increases occur in summer and autumn. Fire seasons will become longer in many regions. The future fire potential increase will be less pronounced in the northern Rocky Mountains due to the changes in humidity and wind. Present fire potential is found to have been increasing across continental U.S. in recent decades. The future KBDI increase in the central Plains and the South projected using the HadCM3–HRM3 climate change scenario is smaller than the increases using the climate change scenarios from most of other NARCCAP model combinations. Larger inter-seasonal and inter-annual fire potential variability is expected in the future in the Pacific and Atlantic coastal regions. The projected increases in wildfire potential for many regions of the U.S. suggest that increased resources and management efforts for disaster prevention and recovery would be needed in the future.},

	abstract = {Future anthropogenic climate change is likely to increase the air temperature (T {\textasciicircum}sub a{\textasciicircum}) across Europe and increase the frequency, duration and magnitude of severe heat stress events. Heat stress events are generally associated with clear-sky conditions and high T {\textasciicircum}sub a{\textasciicircum}, which give rise to high radiant heat load, i.e. mean radiant temperature (T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum}). In urban environments, T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} is strongly influenced by urban geometry. The present study examines the effect of urban geometry on daytime heat stress in three European cities (Gothenburg in Sweden, Frankfurt in Germany and Porto in Portugal) under present and future climates, using T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} as an indicator of heat stress. It is found that severe heat stress occurs in all three cities. Similar maximum daytime T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} is found in open areas in all three cities despite of the latitudinal differences in average daytime T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum}. In contrast, dense urban structures like narrow street canyons are able to mitigate heat stress in the summer, without causing substantial changes in T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} in the winter. Although the T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} averages are similar for the north-south and east-west street canyons in each city, the number of hours when T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} exceeds the threshold values of 55.5 and 59.4 °C--used as indicators of moderate and severe heat stress--in the north-south canyons is much higher than that in the east-west canyons. Using statistically downscaled data from a regional climate model, it is found that the study sites were generally warmer in the future scenario, especially Porto, which would further exacerbate heat stress in urban areas. However, a decrease in solar radiation in Gothenburg and Frankfurt reduces T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} in the spring, while the reduction in T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} is somewhat offset by increasing T {\textasciicircum}sub a{\textasciicircum} in other seasons. It suggests that changes in the T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} under the future scenario are dominated by variations in T {\textasciicircum}sub a{\textasciicircum}. Nonetheless, the intra-urban differences remain relatively stable in the future. These findings suggest that dense urban structure can reduce daytime heat stress since it reduces the number of hours of high T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} in the summer and does not cause substantial changes in average and minimum T {\textasciicircum}sub mrt{\textasciicircum} in the winter. In dense urban settings, a more diverse urban thermal environment is also preferred to compensate for reduced solar access in the winter. The extent to which the urban geometry can be optimized for the future climate is also influenced by local urban characteristics.},

Along with these basic changes, other climate variables like solar insolation, downwelling (longwave) radiant heat, and winds may change. Together these climate changes may result in changes in the hydrology of the Tahoe basin and potential changes in lake overturning and ecological regimes. Current climate projections, however, are generally spatially too coarse (with grid cells separated by 1 to 2° latitude and longitude) for direct use in assessments of the vulnerabilities of the much smaller Tahoe basin. Thus, daily temperatures, precipitation, winds, and downward radiation fluxes from selected global projections have been downscaled by a statistical method called the constructed-analogues method onto 10 to 12Â km grids over the Southwest and especially over Lake Tahoe. Precipitation, solar insolation and winds over the Tahoe basin change only moderately (and with indeterminate signs) in the downscaled projections, whereas temperatures and downward longwave fluxes increase along with imposed increases in global greenhouse-gas concentrations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

By involving local stakeholders we elaborated four plausible scenarios for the transformation of an industrial area in the city of Zug, Switzerland. Based on life cycle analysis methods and urban energy modelling, we estimated the carbon and energy footprint of every scenario due to construction, operation, retrofit and dismantling of buildings, production processes and logistics, commuting, and business flights. The results of our research present a comprehensive description of focal points of environmental impact in future forms of urban development and a description of the role of industry in a transition towards more sustainable urban environments.

	abstract = {Since local weather and climate greatly affect the construction and performance of buildings, reliable meteorological
data is essential when simulating building performance. It is well understood that climate change will affect future
weather and there is a growing interest in generating future weather files to support climate resilient building design.
Weather files that account for climate change have not been widely used for the lower mainland region of British
Columbia. In this study, hourly weather files for future climate conditions in Vancouver are created for three time periods
using a “morphing” methodology. Morphing uses results from global climate models to adjust observed weather data
at a specific location. In this study, daily data from climate simulations for the RCP8.5 emission scenario have been
used. The weather variables that have been adjusted are dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, cloud
cover, wind speed and atmospheric pressure. The impact of climate change on the energy performance of a multi-unit
residential building located on the University of BC campus is analyzed using the energy modelling software
EnergyPlus. The simulation results indicate that the changing climate in Vancouver, following RCP8.5, would have a
considerable effect on building energy performance and energy demand due to decrease in space heating and increase
in cooling requirements.

Morphing combines present-day observed weather data with results from climate models. The procedure yields weather time series thatencapsulate the average weather conditions of future climate scenarios, whilst preserving realistic weather sequences. In this sense the method 'downscales' coarse resolution climate model predictions to the fine spatial and temporal resolutions required for building thermal simulations. Themorphing procedure is illustrated by application to CIBSE design weather years and climate change scenarios for the UK. Heating degree days calculated from the weather series morphed to future climates show a marked reduction compared to present day, by an amount that agrees well with resultscalculated directly from the climate model. This agreement gives confidence that the morphing technique faithfully transforms the weather sequences.Practical application: There is overwhelming consensus amongst the scientific community that the Earth's climate is warming.This warming will have implications for building services in the UK that should be considered now. This article describes a method for producing weather data with best current estimates of future climate that can be used to quantify the risk of building overheating.},

Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to MAS problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multi-agent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning, RL or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including RL, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss direct and indirect communication in connection with learning, plus open issues in task decomposition, scalability, and adaptive dynamics. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, and a list of multi-agent learning resources.},

The authors review alternative LUCC modeling techniques and discuss the ways in which MAS/LUCC models may overcome some important limitations of existing techniques. We briefly review ongoing MAS/LUCC modeling efforts in four research areas. We discuss the potential strengths of MAS/LUCC models and suggest that these strengths guide researchers in assessing the appropriate choice of model for their particular research question. We find that MAS/LUCC models are particularly well suited for representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions and for modeling decentralized, autonomous decision making. We discuss a range of possible roles for MAS/LUCC models, from abstract models designed to derive stylized hypotheses to empirically detailed simulation models appropriate for scenario and policy analysis. We also discuss the challenge of validation and verification for MAS/LUCC models. Finally, we outline important challenges and open research questions in this new field. We conclude that, while significant challenges exist, these models offer a promising new tool for researchers whose goal is to create fine-scale models of LUCC phenomena that focus on human-environment interactions.},

The high share and temporal variability of the lighting demand make it of special interest, in particular when the models are to be used in simulations of distributed photovoltaics (PV), which to a high degree is negatively correlated with the lighting demand. In this paper, a stochastic bottom-up model based on domestic occupancy patterns and data on daylight availability is presented. A three-state non-homogeneous Markov chain is used for generation of occupancy patterns and a conversion model transforms occupancy patterns to lighting demand, with respect to the daylight level. Markov-chain transition probabilities are determined from a detailed set of time-use (TU) data in Swedish households and the parameters in the occupancy-to-lighting conversion model are adjusted to make the resulting load curves fit recent measurements on aggregate population level. The performance of the model is analysed by comparison of simulated demand to measured lighting demand. It is concluded that for both individual households and aggregate demand, all relevant features of measured demand are realistically reproduced.},

The intended capability of DELORES is to stochastically generate such profiles for use in common building energy models, such as TRNSYS and EnergyPlus, and do so whilst presenting users with a straight-forward, easy-to-use interface.

	abstract = {Several factors contribute to on-going challenges of spatial planning and urban policy in megacities, including rapid population shifts, less organized urban areas, and a lack of data with which to monitor urban growth and land use change. To support Mumbai's sustainable development, this research was conducted to examine past urban land use changes on the basis of remote sensing data collected between 1973 and 2010. An integrated Markov Chains–Cellular Automata (MC–CA) urban growth model was implemented to predict the city's expansion for the years 2020–2030. To consider the factors affecting urban growth, the MC–CA model was also connected to multi-criteria evaluation to generate transition probability maps. The results of the multi-temporal change detection show that the highest urban growth rates, 142\% occurred between 1973 and 1990. In contrast, the growth rates decreased to 40\% between 1990 and 2001 and decreased to 38\% between 2001 and 2010. The areas most affected by this degradation were open land and croplands. The MC–CA model predicts that this trend will continue in the future. Compared to the reference year, 2010, increases in built-up areas of 26\% by 2020 and 12\% by 2030 are forecast. Strong evidence is provided for complex future urban growth, characterized by a mixture of growth patterns. The most pronounced of these is urban expansion toward the north along the main traffic infrastructure, linking the two currently non-affiliated main settlement ribbons. Additionally, urban infill developments are expected to emerge in the eastern areas, and these developments are expected to increase urban pressure.},

	abstract = {Simulation modeling along with scenario analysis is a useful tool for urban planning, by providing an appraisement of different alternatives and tradeoffs and thus contributing to improved decision making. The objective of this study is to explore potential future urban dynamics in the Messoghia plain, (peri-urban Athens, Greece) under four scenarios that reflect future growth traits in the area related to different economic performance realities and alternative policies. Messoghia, a predominantly rural area, experienced significant and unregulated urban growth, during the past decades, due to the construction of the international airport in the area, the significant allocation of funds triggered by 2004 Olympics and the absence of planning controls. However, the late economic circumstances significantly affected the growth trends in the area. First, the paper looks at the periodic changes occurred during the past three decades (1980–2015) employing remote sensing techniques and Landsat data. The observed changes are then combined with 20 dynamic, biophysical, socio-economic and legislative factors, to produce transition potential maps using the Random Forests algorithm. Scenarios are projected until 2045 by implementing a spatially explicit Cellular Automata model. Under an economically optimistic scenario which means high or medium development circumstances, and given the absence of an adequate controlling mechanism, the artificial surfaces are expected to nearly double in size, by 2045. In case of a continuation of economic scarcity which can be translated in low or very low development, the artificial surfaces are expected to increase by 9\% or 6\% respectively, by 2045.},

	abstract = {Cellular Automata (CA) \& Markov-Chain modeling are concepts that are utilized in numerous branches of science. Powerful as they are independently, these two theoretical concepts can be of immense use when fused together and applied in practical situations. CA and Markov models have spread their wraths over geosciences and with the advancement of remote sensing and GIS technologies along with an exponential increase in computing and modeling power. Over the last few years, these concepts have found a solid ground for research in this domain of geospatial environmental modeling in earth sciences. It is widely used to characterize the dynamics of land use/cover, forest cover, urban sprawl, wetland landscape, plant growth and modeling of watershed management, suitable site selection, coastal zone management and so forth. This paper aims to categorize these researches into broad categories. This paper discusses the concepts of CA-Markov modeling and their backgrounds and is followed by a classification of the researches conducted in this domain into two broad groups, one being the development of concepts and the adopted methodologies, while the other discusses the application of these methods in solving and studying real world scenarios. Recent developments in this domain have been observed which uses concepts and technologies previously unused in conjunction to CA. However, several limitations like non-accountability of human influences, unavailability of high resolution imagery, primary discrepancy between the simulations of CA with GIS, human decision making were also addressed in details. At the same time numerous advancements like inclusion of fuzzy logic, possibility of textural classification, removing biases in simulation and developing a CA-based 2D and 3D land use simulation module are elaborated which are at present showing some promising avenues wherein significant research can be done in future.},

	abstract = {Assessing the impacts of a mobility initiative prior to deployment is a complex task for both urban planners and transport companies. Computational models like Tangramob offer an agent-based framework for simulating the evolution of urban traffic after the introduction of new mobility services. However, simulations can be computationally expensive to perform due to their iterative nature and the microscopic representation of traffic. To address this issue, we designed a simplified model architecture of Tangramob in Timed Rebeca (TRebeca) and we developed a tool-chain for the generation runnable instances of this model starting from the same input files of Tangramob. Running TRebeca models allows users to get an idea of how the mobility initiatives under study affect the traveling experience of commuters, in a short time and without the need to use the simulator during this first experimental step. Then, once a subset of these initiatives is identified according to user's criteria, it is reasonable to simulate them with Tangramob in order to get more detailed results. To validate this approach, we compared the output of both the simulator and the TRebeca model on a collection of mobility initiatives. The correlation between the results demonstrates the usefulness of using TRebeca models for unconventional contexts of application.},

Rarely such a kind of models can be studied analytically; more often they are studied by simulation. Among the problems encountered in ABM calibration, the choice of the criteria to fit can appear arbitrary. Markov chain analysis can come through to identify a standard procedure able to face this issue. Indeed, Izquierdo et al. (J Artif Soc Soc Simul 12(16):1–6, 2009) show that many computer simulation models can be represented as Markov chains. Exploiting such an idea classical minimum distance and its simulated counterpart, i.e., simulated minimum distance, are discussed theoretically and applied to Kirman model, which can be reformulated as a Markov chain. Comparison with approximate Bayesian computation is also addressed.},

	abstract = {Involving a wide-range of stakeholders at different moments in the planning of urban adaptation to climate change can help to overcome different barriers to adaptation, such as a lack of common perception, or control over options. This Article argues for an approach that involves a wide range of actors throughout the planning process in order to confront the challenges of urban adaptation to climate change. It builds on the results of a three-year participatory action research project to identify the catalysts with which local administrations can overcome the lack of data, the low level of engagement around the climate issue, and the cause-and-effect linkages of climate change impacts on the urban environment. Significant factors include territorial rootedness, leveraging actors’ experience, interaction between actors, as well as the valuing of local actors as experts of territorial management rather than as novices with regard to climate change adaptation. In addition to contributing towards the engagement of a large number of stakeholders around adaptation issues, a planning process that involves representatives from various sectors and during several stages contributes to a greater understanding of these issues and their linkages. It follows that such a process will bring changes to urban practices by better articulating local concerns about climatic issues.Policy relevanceAlthough participation is commonly advocated in policy responses to climate change, only few empirical studies have investigated the ways in which local actors' knowledge can be integrated into climate change adaptation planning processes. The article builds on the results of an action research project carried out in Québec City, Canada, to address the relevance of involving a progressively broader range of actors as the adaptation process moves through its various phases. Given that a multitude of barriers to adaptation are at play at different times in a municipality, collaborations between local stakeholders emerge as a key factor. These collaborations provide greater insight into the linkages between climate change impacts and the urban environment and, in doing so, bring into question ordinary urban management and design practices.},

	abstract = {This paper explores two main objectives: first, simulates the urban growth of a Ghanaian city-region with a CA model, drawing implications for urban planning and policy; and, second, explores the sensitivity of CA models to predominantly informal and un-regulated urban growth trajectories. CA model, SLEUTH, is calibrated for Accra city-region, and the results are triangulated with, knowledge from key local stakeholders, and findings from existing studies. The study finds that, compared with cases around the world, urban expansion in Accra city-region is highly spontaneous, rapid and unguided; and new developments fast turn into urban growth nuclei. These have reflected in a sharp rise of the city-region's land under built-up from less than 4 percent in 1990 to about 15 percent in 2015, and it is further simulated to reach around 33 percent by 2040, posing serious challenges to urban management, and threats to sustainable development. The Ghanaian planning system faces the option of swiftly addressing emerging unguided developments or wait and be confronted with a more daunting challenge of managing multiple informal growth nuclei. We also find that the applied CA model is sensitive to the highly informal urban growth trajectory of the city-region. Going forward, it is imperative for policy makers to build a more proactive, stronger and functional planning system; treat every single informal development as a potential threat to urban sustainability; and target pressure areas of expansion. The model's sensitivity to the growth trajectory of Accra city-region suggests that CA models could function as decision support tools even in overwhelmingly informal and less regulated contexts like Ghana.},

In this context, architects habitually defer to a technocratic, scientistic posture to validate a range of design strategies and agendas, often through simulation techniques. But as the contemporary philosophy of science establishes, the ontology of projective simulations for buildings, cities and climates exists to simulate dynamics in contexts for which data are necessarily scarce (otherwise an experiment would provide more reliable knowledge). This scarcity of data, in turn, makes the process of validation a compromised, at best, proposition.Whilst the scientism of contemporary architecture is ostensibly secular in its disposition, its models of faith-based simulation suggest otherwise. However, in contexts for which data are scarce, as the philosopher Eric Winsberg observes, fables offer an alternative, dissimulating mode of knowledge production and transmission that imparts reliability precisely by announcing their often preposterous fictions, rather than concealing the murkiness of their ontology in scientistic representations. All of this raises numerous questions about our modes of architectural reasoning and imagination today. As architecture aims to address projective scenarios for which real data are scarce, our model of models must evolve.},

This paper proposed a new framework to predict dynamic change and intrinsic structure of urban ecological footprint with the Markov chain. The system dynamic model based on Markov chain was then established for estimating Beijing's footprint during the period of 2001–2020. The results showed that Beijing's footprint kept stable in the long term due to steady consumption pattern and environmental mitigation policy. The footprint intensity has been decreasing constantly due to the expanding population against the stable total footprint. Energy consumption was found to be the major contributor to Beijing's footprint. Sensitivity analysis was also presented by testing the population and economic growth under five scenarios. This work may provide insights into the land metabolism mechanism and guidance for urban planning.},

Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental inﬂuences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

Our approach tightly integrates and extends a space discretization crowd simulator with inverse procedural modelling. We extend crowd simulation by goal exploration (i.e. agents are initially unaware of the goal locations), variable-appealing sign usage and several acceleration schemes. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo to quickly explore the solution space and yield interactive design. We have applied our method to a variety of virtual and real-world locations, yielding one order of magnitude faster crowd simulation performance over related methods and several fold improvement of crowd indicators.},

	abstract = {Buildings are signiﬁcant drivers of climate change, generating one third of global greenhouse gas emissions. When new buildings are constructed to high performance standards, increased rates of building replacement spurred by rising property values can raise the operating eﬃciency of building stocks. However, it can take years before the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with new construction are offset by more eﬃcient operations. This paper calculates the carbon dioxide emission payback period of newly constructed eﬃcient single family homes in Vancouver, British Columbia. The average carbon dioxide emission payback period of 168 years for a typical high eﬃciency new home renders it unlikely that emission savings will be realized before it is replaced. A statistical model called the Teardown Index is presented, which indicates that replacing older poorly performing homes with new high eﬃciency homes in Vancouver will result in 1.3–2.8 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 2017 and 2050. For each percent increase to the compound annual growth rate of property values, an additional 150 thousand tonnes of CO2e will be released between 2017-2050. The ﬁndings suggest that current policies aimed at reducing emissions through new high eﬃciency buildings should be reconsidered.},

Contributions of the latest research from international experts examine external forces applied to the practice and discipline of architecture.

The Companion contains thirty-five chapters, divided into seven parts: Theoretical Stances, Technology, Sustainability, Behavorism, Urbanism, Professional Practice and Society. Topics include: Evidence-Based Design, Performativity, Designing for Net Zero Energy, The Substance of Light in Design, Social Equity and Ethics for Sustainable Architecture, Universal Design, Design Psychology, Architecture, Branding and the Politics of Identity, The Role of BIM in Green Architecture, Public Health and the Design Process, Affordable Housing, Disaster Preparation and Mitigation, Diversity and many more. Each chapter follows the running theme of examining external forces applied to the practice and discipline of architecture in order to uncover the evolving theoretical tenets of what constitutes today s architectural profession, and the tools that will be required of the future architect. This book considers architecture s interdisciplinary nature, and addresses its current and evolving perspectives related to social, economic, environmental, technological, and globalization trends. These challenges are central to the future direction of architecture and as such this Companion will serve as an invaluable reference for undergraduate and postgraduate students, existing practitioners and future architects."},

	abstract = {Buildings consume nearly 40\% of primary energy production globally. Certiﬁed green buildings substantially reduce energy consumption on a per square foot basis and they also focus on indoor environmental quality. However, the co-beneﬁts to health through reductions in energy and concomitant reductions in air pollution have not been examined.We calculated year by year LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certiﬁcation rates in six countries (the United States, China, India, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey) and then used data from the Green Building Information Gateway (GBIG) to estimate energy savings in each country each year. Of the green building rating schemes, LEED accounts for 32\% of greencertiﬁed ﬂoor space and publically reports energy efﬁciency data. We employed Harvard’s Co-BE Calculator to determine pollutant emissions reductions by country accounting for transient energy mixes and baseline energy use intensities. Co-BE applies the social cost of carbon and the social cost of atmospheric release to translate these reductions into health beneﬁts. Based on modeled energy use, LEED-certiﬁed buildings saved \$7.5B in energy costs and averted 33MT of CO2, 51 kt of SO2, 38 kt of NOx, and 10 kt of PM2.5 from entering the atmosphere, which amounts to \$5.8B (lower limit = \$2.3B, upper limit = \$9.1B) in climate and health co-beneﬁts from 2000 to 2016 in the six countries investigated. The U.S. health beneﬁts derive from avoiding an estimated 172–405 premature deaths, 171 hospital admissions, 11,000 asthma exacerbations, 54,000 respiratory symptoms, 21,000 lost days of work, and 16,000 lost days of school. Because the climate and health beneﬁts are nearly equivalent to the energy savings for green buildings in the United States, and up to 10 times higher in developing countries, they provide an important and previously unquantiﬁed societal value. Future analyses should consider these cobeneﬁts when weighing policy decisions around energy-efﬁcient buildings.},

It outlines the concept of an original spatiality of being that is opposed to the philosophies of space in both physics and Cartesian metaphysics. Through an elaboration of the essentially relational character of Da-sein, it is argued that Heidegger’s vocabulary in ‘Being and Time’ yields an onto-topology that shows Da-sein’s primary spatial embeddedness in the world. Finally, the paper argues that Heidegger’s concept of spatiality remained cursory due to its residual existentialist focus. In this context, it attempts a re-evaluation of its intellectual trajectory within the realm of the Spheres project.},

	abstract = {In some sub-urban areas, planning the distribution of resources is a highly difficult mission that is often done in retrospect, as a response to the (illegal) development of new built areas. The Arab settlements in the Galilee are organic entities and can be perceived as organic ‘communities’. Their built morphology is unique and does not follow strict geometrical patterns. The streets in these settlements do not align, and there is no visible continuity of their morphology. The difficulty in predicting the development of these settlements challenges the ability of the local authorities to adjust their planning in terms of urban infrastructure and facilities. This leads to low maintenance of the urban systems. Computer simulation models that mimic the development of such settlements could help understand the development trends and support future alternative designs. This may lead to better control and distribution of urban resources by local authorities and thus to an improved quality of life of the residents. In this paper, the potential and possible use of a preliminary agent-based cellular automata model is illustrated. This model mimics the development of sub-urban Arab (organic) settlements in the Galilee. It can be used to identify the influence of various scenarios of top down urban planning on the built environment. For example, planners can use this model to study the influence of different transportation paths on the city’s development. This work is based on the perception of urban and sub-urban entities as complex ones. These systems fit the definition of complex as they are governed by many agents that act in space and time, and are motivated by various forces. The interactions between these agents control the evolution of the built environment. In a preliminary study, we considered Sachnin as a case study and identified diverse forces that influence the development of the organic Arab settlement. We developed a preliminary model based on the traditional patriarchal form of the Arab family, as its influence on the settlement’s development is very significant. We showed that identifying one of the most influential processes that are related to the Arab settlements leads to a better understanding of the urban evolution in terms of spatial distribution and morphological configuration.},

	abstract = {A common dilemma for planners is how to design urban settlements that give people easy access to a center and nature. Difficulties arise because each household's access to such elements is a function of other households' location and the set of potential arrangements is constrained by the households' degree of acceptance of different density levels. This paper suggests the ideal arrangement of built-up and green areas may be identified by simulating in an agent-based model (ABM) the interactions of virtual households that try to find the best residential location based on their preferences towards distance from the center, proximity to green space and density. Simulations showed that the ABM can, iteration after iteration, develop progressively better configurations and eventually get to an equilibrium if households' locational choice is driven not only by the maximization of individual utility, but also the preservation of the neighbors' well-being. Model's outputs suggest that compact settlements with an even distribution of green spaces offer the greatest benefits to their inhabitants, and that larger green areas are to be preferred when the population is less sensitive to density and/or the travel to the center is faster along some directions. Application of a rent formation model on the configurations generated by the ABM shows that these are relatively equitable, as lower income households could afford at least half of all locations. Future improvements can turn this model into a suitable tool for designing new settlements, guiding the densification of existing settlements or defining zoning regulations.},

	abstract = {Climate change is one of the greatest environmental, economic and social challenges in the history of mankind and nowadays is considered as the biggest environmental problem of the world. Climate change has a significant global impact and therefore Greece has to deal with its effects as well. Agriculture has been unfavourably affected in recent years, as the current and anticipated conditions in many cases seem to be rather prohibitive for the prosperity of the cultivated crops. On the contrary, these new conditions have made it possible for new plant species previously cultivated only in subtropical regions, to thrive in Greece. Moreover, economic reasons would make it rather necessary for the agricultural industry to cultivate alternative crops, which are thoroughly analysed in the present study. Based on Heating Degree Days (HDD) Greece is divided into four climatic zones. The variations in the mean maximum, mean minimum and mean temperature in each climate zone as well as the rainfall over the last 50 years (from 1964 to 2013) are reviewed in this paper. The outcome of this research is that it is not feasible for the studied alternative crops to thrive in all climate zones or vice versa. However, some of them and particularly crops such as quinoa, maca, psyllium, chia, cassava and pecan can be cultivated in all climate zones. It has also to be noted that adequate water is necessary for almost all the examined crops in order to achieve optimal growth and yield and therefore irrigations are rather necessary for specific species and climate zones.},

	abstract = {Buildings are significant drivers of climate change, generating one third of global greenhouse gas emissions. When new buildings are constructed to high performance standards, increased rates of building replacement spurred by rising property values can raise the operating efficiency of building stocks. However, it can take years before the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with new construction are offset by more efficient operations. This paper calculates the carbon dioxide emission payback period of newly constructed efficient single family homes in Vancouver, British Columbia. The average carbon dioxide emission payback period of 168 years for a typical high efficiency new home renders it unlikely that emission savings will be realized before it is replaced. A statistical model called the Teardown Index is presented, which indicates that replacing older poorly performing homes with new high efficiency homes in Vancouver will result in 1.3–2.8 million tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 2017 and 2050. For each percent increase to the compound annual growth rate of property values, an additional 150 thousand tonnes of CO2e will be released between 2017-2050. The findings suggest that current policies aimed at reducing emissions through new high efficiency buildings should be reconsidered.},

As building is one of the largest energy consuming sectors, it is essential to study the impact of climate change on building energy performance. In this regard, building energy simulation software is a useful tool. A set of appropriate typical weather files is one of the key factors towards successful building energy simulation. This paper reports the work of developing a set of weather data files for subtropical Hong Kong, taking into the effect of future climate change. Projected monthly mean climate changes from a selected General Circulation Model for three future periods under two emission scenarios were integrated into an existing typical meteorological year weather file by a morphing method. Through this work, six sets of future weather files for subtropical Hong Kong were produced. A typical office building and a residential flat were modeled using building simulation program EnergyPlus. Hourly building energy simulations were carried out. The simulated results indicate that there will be substantial increase in A/C energy consumption under the impact of future climate change, ranging from 2.6\% to 14.3\% and from 3.7\% to 24\% for office building and residential flat, respectively.},

An approach is presented for ‘morphing’ existing EnergyPlus/ESP-r Weather (EPW) data with UK Met Office Hadley Centre general circulation model (GCM) predictions for a ‘medium–high’ emissions scenario (A2). It was found that, for the United Kingdom (UK), the GCM ‘morphed’ data shows a smoothing effect relative to data generated from the corresponding regional climate model (RCM) outputs. This is confirmed by building performance simulations of a naturally ventilated UK office building which highlight a consistent temperature distribution profile between GCM and RCM ‘morphed’ data, yet with a shift in the distribution. It is demonstrated that, until more detailed RCM data becomes available globally, ‘morphing’ with GCM data can be considered as a viable interim approach to generating climate change adapted weather data.},

	abstract = {Simulation packages for predicting building performance in terms of energy and comfort are becoming increasingly important in the planning process. However, current industry standard weather files for building simulation are not suited to the assessment of the potential impacts of a changing climate, in particular summer overheating risks. In addition, no bespoke climate change weather files are readily available that can be loaded directly into environmental simulation software. This paper describes the integration of future UK climate scenarios into the widely used Typical Meteorological Year (TMY2) and EnergyPlus/ESP-r Weather (EPW) file formats and demonstrates the importance of climate change analysis through a case study example. The ‘morphing’ methodology published by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) is utilised as a baseline for transforming current CIBSE Test Reference Years (TRY) and Design Summer Years (DSY) into climate change weather years. A tool is presented that allows generation of TMY2/EPW files from this ‘morphed’ data and addresses the requirements related to solar irradiation, temperature, humidity and daylighting beyond the parameters provided by CIBSE weather years. Simulations of a case study building highlight the potential impact of climate change on future summer overheating hours inside naturally ventilated buildings.},

With the publication of the most recent UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) such data can be created for future years up to the end of the 21st century and for various predictions of climate change by one of two methods: mathematical transformations of observed weather (morphing), or the use of a synthetic weather generator. Here current and future weather is created by both of these methods for three locations within the UK and their statistical signatures discussed. Although the potential to use both products to investigate the effects of climate change is clear, it is found that the use of UKCP09 climate change anomalies within the morphing procedure give an unrealistic representations of future temperatures both mathematically and physically, limiting its use.},

	abstract = {This research investigates projecting and ‘morphing’ weather files for building energy simulations in order to calculate lifetime energy consumption. Multiple weather-file modification tools and morphing methodologies have been developed over the last couple of decades to account for variable climate patterns. Two tools were used in this work to evaluate potential climate projections and explore differences in uncertainty and assumptions when applied to the same set of prototype buildings. The research uses Boston, Miami and San Francisco as diverse cities representing different climate challenges and to study regional effects on complete long-term energy use in future scenarios. The most recent climate projections from the IPCC and UKCP09 are compared with historic projections to understand how variances in algorithms alter building energy use over time. The comparison of energy simulations using ‘morphed’ weather files under different methodologies, current climate forecasts and adjusted emissions scenarios are visualized and discussed to demonstrate the impact of climate change on building energy consumption. Some results are to be expected, but Boston’s decreasing future energy use intensity (EUI) and variations in rates of change exhibit the importance of considering future climate projections in building energy simulations.},

The algorithm performed as well as an architect on 77\% of offices, and achieved a higher capacity in an additional 6\%, all while following a set of space standards. If the algorithm used the space standards the same way as an architect (a more relaxed interpretation), the algorithm achieved a 97\% match rate, which means that the algorithm completed this design task as well as a designer and in a shorter time. The benchmarking of a layout algorithm against thousands of existing designs is a novel contribution of this article, and we argue that it might be a first step toward a more comprehensive method to automate parts of the office layout process.},

	abstract = {Commercial wind towers are passive ventilation technology based on traditional wind towers of the Middle East. Typical operation of wind towers in cold e mild climates is generally limited to summerseasons as the outdoor air is too cold to be introduced into spaces for the majority of the year. In addition, the use of natural ventilation solutions has been seen to increase heat loss in buildings and lead to increased energy cost. Wind towers are normally shut down for the sake of avoiding indoor heating energy losses during winter months. Consequently, the concentration of pollutants has seen to rise above the guideline levels, which can lead to ill health. To improve the year-round capabilities of wind towers, a heat recovery system utilising the combination of heat pipes and heat sink was incorporated into a multidirectional wind tower. This study investigates the potential of this concept through the use of numerical analysis and wind tunnel experiments for validation. The ﬁndings showed that the wind tower with heat pipes was capable of meeting the required ventilation rates above an inlet air velocity of 1 m/s. In addition to sufﬁcient ventilation, the integration of heat pipes had a positive effect on thermal performance of the wind tower; it raised the supply air by up to 4.5 K. The technology presented here is subject to a patent application (PCT/GB2014/052263).},

Energy modelers spend considerable time translating software results in to a suitable format for the program administrator. This paper recommends a standard results format to serve as a sort of Rosetta Stone to ease and facilitate communication between energy modelers and energy program administrators. The standard format is electronic and defined as an extended markup language (XML) schema. Each software application can write simple routines to port their results to this format and each program administrator can write simple parsing routines to read the standard XML format and transfer it to their database format.},

Recent market, technology and policy drivers have resulted in widespread data collection by stakeholders across the buildings industry. Consolidation of independently collected and maintained datasets presents a cost-effective opportunity to build a database of unprecedented size. Applications of the data include peer group analysis to evaluate building performance, and data-driven algorithms that use empirical data to estimate energy savings associated with building retrofits. This paper discusses technical considerations in compiling such a database using the DOE Buildings Performance Database (BPD) as a case study. We gathered data on over 750,000 residential and commercial buildings. We describe the process and challenges of mapping and cleansing data from disparate sources. We analyze the distributions of buildings in the BPD relative to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), evaluating peer groups of buildings that are well or poorly represented, and discussing how differences in the distributions of the three datasets impact use-cases of the data. Finally, we discuss the usefulness and limitations of the current dataset and the outlook for increasing its size and applications.},

This paper investigates the generation of climate change adapted simulation weather data for locations worldwide from readily available data sets. An approach is presented for ‘morphing’ existing EnergyPlus/ESP-r Weather (EPW) data with UK Met Office Hadley Centre general circulation model (GCM) predictions for a ‘medium–high’ emissions scenario (A2). It was found that, for the United Kingdom (UK), the GCM ‘morphed’ data shows a smoothing effect relative to data generated from the corresponding regional climate model (RCM) outputs. This is confirmed by building performance simulations of a naturally ventilated UK office building which highlight a consistent temperature distribution profile between GCM and RCM ‘morphed’ data, yet with a shift in the distribution. It is demonstrated that, until more detailed RCM data becomes available globally, ‘morphing’ with GCM data can be considered as a viable interim approach to generating climate change adapted weather data.},

In this paper, we conducted a life cycle assessment (from “cradle” to “grave”) of decorative ceramic façade panel products from a typical ceramic enterprise in South China. Both the sales aspect and material recycling were considered. Using Ebalance software and its Chinese parameters, we assessed seven environmental impacts of the ceramic panels, including depletion of abiotic resources, photochemical oxidant creation, global warming, acidiﬁcation, eutrophication, ozone depletion and human toxicity. We also compared the environmental performance of ceramic façade panels with three other traditional curtain wall materialsdglass, marble and aluminum platedusing data from the literature. The results from a consideration of the life cycle from “cradle” to “gate” showed that ceramic façade panels had better environmental performance than the others, in general, but was worse than glass on the depletion of abiotic resources performance and was worse than glass and aluminum on the human toxicity performance. Finally, we offer some suggestions for optimizing the life cycle process of ceramic façade panels for better environmental performance and some recommendations for better selection of façade materials.},

	abstract = {Retrofitting of existing buildings offers significant opportunities for reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This is being considered as one of main approaches to achieving sustainability in the built environment at relatively low cost and high uptake rates. Although there are a wide range of retrofit technologies readily available, methods to identify the most cost-effective retrofit measures for particular projects is still a major technical challenge. This paper provides a systematic approach to proper selection and identification of the best retrofit options for existing buildings. The generic building retrofit problem and key issues that are involved in building retrofit investment decisions are presented. Major retrofit activities are also briefly discussed, such as energy auditing, building performance assessment, quantification of energy benefits, economic analysis, risk assessment, and measurement and verification (M\&V) of energy savings, all of which are essential to the success of a building retrofit project. An overview of the research and development as well as application of the retrofit technologies in existing buildings is also provided. The aim of this work is to provide building researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of how to effectively conduct a building retrofit to promote energy conservation and sustainability.},

	abstract = {The need to reduce energy use as part of a strategy to alleviate environmental stresses is widely accepted. Buildings are big end-users of energy; buildings account for 20-40\% of the energy demands in developed nations, and the rate of new building construction in developing nations is accelerating. To reduce the impact that buildings have on the environment, the need for them to use as little energy as possible while still providing a satisfactory indoor environment is critical. The green building movement may be an effective catalyst for this, and various green building rating schemes are now in the marketplace worldwide. Certified “green” commercial buildings exhibit higher real-estate values, presumably reflecting expectations for reduced operating costs, and improved organizational productivity through better indoor environments for employees. However, the higher market value cannot be maintained in the long run if these buildings do not deliver their expected benefits. The early generations of “green” certified commercial buildings have now been occupied for several years, and it is time to explore whether these “green” buildings are living up to expectations in objective terms. This paper reviews several of the post occupancy evaluations (POEs) that have been performed. A limited number of POEs are available in the public domain, making it difficult to draw solid conclusions. However, early trends suggest that green buildings on average seem to be delivering reduced energy use, however a large spread in performance is often observed meaning that individual buildings do not always perform as expected. Occupant satisfaction with some aspects of the indoor environment appears to have improved compared to conventional buildings, but there are areas where expected improvement trends are not realized. This paper provides some possible explanations for the observed performance, and describes a new, Canadian-led, research project that aims to explore these issues further.},

	abstract = {The rapidly growing world energy use has already raised concerns over supply difficulties, exhaustion of energy resources and heavy environmental impacts (ozone layer depletion, global warming, climate change, etc.). The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching figures between 20\% and 40\% in developed countries, and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. For this reason, energy efficiency in buildings is today a prime objective for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. Among building services, the growth in HVAC systems energy use is particularly significant (50\% of building consumption and 20\% of total consumption in the USA). This paper analyses available information concerning energy consumption in buildings, and particularly related to HVAC systems. Many questions arise: Is the necessary information available? Which are the main building types? What end uses should be considered in the breakdown? Comparisons between different countries are presented specially for commercial buildings. The case of offices is analysed in deeper detail.},

	abstract = {The importance of post-occupancy evaluation (POE) is widely acknowledged in the academic literature, industry press and, increasingly, by professional institutes. Learning from previous projects systematically is central to improving building performance, resulting in a built environment that better fits the needs of clients, end users, wider society and the environment. The key role of architects in pushing forward this agenda has been recognized, however evidence suggests that take up of POE is low across the profession. Whilst research has investigated barriers to POE across the construction industry, very little has considered the unique perspective of architects. In-depth interviews with UK-based architects are presented to explore their experiences in relation to POE and their perspectives on its potential to be a standard part of architectural practice. The findings indicate that a considerable amount of practical work is being undertaken, but uncertainty over what constitutes POE means it is often excluded from the POE label – with significant implications for the development of a rigorous evidence base. An appetite is identified for more holistic evaluation measures that move beyond the current preoccupation with energy efficiency to consider other aspects of building performance, and thereby sustainability, in a wider value framework.},

	abstract = {The ability to import building geometric and construction thermal data from building information models (BIM) has significant potential to reduce the time and uncertainty in building energy modeling process. In today's BIM-based energy modeling practice, thermal properties are mainly derived from generic building construction types in BIM. However, for energy modeling of existing buildings, such assumptions are often inaccurate as they do not account for diminishing thermal resistances of building materials instigated by their deteriorations. To improve the reliability of BIM-based energy modeling, we present a system, together with new methods for automated association and updating of actual thermal property measurements with BIM elements in gbXML schema. By leveraging collections of digital and thermal images and based on environmental measurements, our system first produces a 3D thermal model for the building under inspection and then derives the actual thermal resistances of the building assemblies at the level of 3D vertexes. By associating these measurements with their corresponding elements in gbXML, thermal properties of the BIM elements are automatically updated. Our experiments in real-world residential and instructional buildings show how actual thermal properties can be automatically associated with BIM elements and updated in gbXML. The proposed method shortens the gap between architectural information in BIM and the actual data needed for energy performance simulation, and enables reliable BIM-based energy analysis for retro-commissioning, continuous commissioning, and retrofit.},

	abstract = {The industrial sector accounts for 17\% of end-use energy in the United Kingdom, and 54\% globally. Therefore, there is substantial scope to accurately simulate and efficiently assess potential energy retrofit options for industrial buildings to lower end use energy. Due to potentially years of facility renovation and expansion Building Energy Modelling, also called Building Energy Simulation, applied to industrial buildings poses a complex challenge; but it is an important opportunity for reducing global energy demand especially considering the increase of readily available computational power compared with a few years ago. Large and complex industrial buildings make modelling existing geometry for Building Energy Modelling difficult and time consuming which impacts analysis workflow and assessment options available within reasonable budgets. This research presents a potential framework for quickly capturing and processing as-built geometry of a factory, or other large scale buildings, to be utilised in Building Energy Modelling by storing the geometry in a green building eXtensible Mark-up Language (gbXML) format, which is compatible with most commercially available Building Energy Modelling tools. Laser scans were captured from the interior of an industrial facility to produce a Point Cloud. The existing capabilities of a Point Cloud processing software and previous research were assessed to identify the potential development opportunities to automate the conversion of Point Clouds to building geometry for Building Energy Modelling applications. This led to the novel identification of a framework for storing the building geometry in the gbXML format and plans for verification of a future Point Cloud processing solution. This resulted in a sample Point Cloud, of a portion of a building, being converted into a gbXML model that met the validation requirements of the gbXML definition schema. In conclusion, an opportunity exists for increasing the speed of 3D geometry creation of existing industrial buildings for application in BEM and subsequent thermal simulation.},

As a result, BEPS model inputs can vary widely from this time consuming, non-standardised and subjective process. This paper proposes a standardised method of information exchange between Building Information Modelling (BIM) and BEPS tools using the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and Model View Definition (MVD) methodologies. The methodology leverages a collection of use cases to initiate the identification of exchange requirements needed by BEPS tools. The IDM/MVD framework captures and translates exchange requirements into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema. The suggested approach aims to facilitate the transfer of information from IFC based BIM to either conventional or advanced BEPS tools (e.g. EnergyPlus and Modelica) through the development of a specific MVD that defines a subset of the IFC data model that deals with building energy performance simulation. By doing so, the potential of BIM-based simulation can be fully unlocked, and a reliable and consistent IFC subset is provided as an input for energy simulation software.},

	abstract = {Buildings contribute to about 40\% of total annual energy consumption in the U.S. and saving a small percentage of that can lead to significant economic and environmental impacts. Building Energy Modeling (BEM) tools are important in reducing building's energy consumption. Most of the available tools only provide total energy consumption related to HVAC system, lighting, hot water, and appliances. While fine-grained data may be available in some computer tools, the process for obtaining these data is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires software-related skills. This paper explains a developed tool that contributes in automation of building energy simulation and providing fine-grained outputs by using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and modified source code of energy simulation tools such as EnergyPlus and OpenStudio. This tool, which is referred to as ABEMAT (Automated Building Energy Modeling and Assessment Tool), receives gbXML file and provides users with the amount of heat transfer through every single building envelope component such as windows, doors, and walls through an automated process. ABEMAT's and EnergyPlus advanced outputs are compared for validation; the latter being a time consuming process and error-prone, which requires software-related skills compared to ABEMAT. Results showed similar findings indicating the functionality of ABEMAT in providing fine-grained outputs.},

	abstract = {Retrofitting building systems is known to provide cost-effective energy savings. However, prioritizing retrofits and computing their expected energy savings and cost/benefits can be a complicated, costly, and an uncertain effort. Prioritizing retrofits for a portfolio of buildings can be even more difficult if the owner must determine different investment strategies for each of the buildings. Meanwhile, we are seeing greater availability of data on building energy use, characteristics, and equipment. These data provide opportunities for the development of algorithms that link building characteristics and retrofits empirically. In this paper we explore the potential of using such data for predicting the expected energy savings from equipment retrofits for a large number of buildings. We show that building data with statistical algorithms can provide savings estimates when detailed energy audits and physics-based simulations are not cost- or time-feasible. We develop a multivariate linear regression model with numerical predictors (e.g., operating hours, occupant density) and categorical indicator variables (e.g., climate zone, heating system type) to predict energy use intensity. The model quantifies the contribution of building characteristics and systems to energy use, and we use it to infer the expected savings when modifying particular equipment. We verify the model using residual analysis and cross-validation. We demonstrate the retrofit analysis by providing a probabilistic estimate of energy savings for several hypothetical building retrofits. We discuss the ways understanding the risk associated with retrofit investments can inform decision making. The contributions of this work are the development of a statistical model for estimating energy savings, its application to a large empirical building dataset, and a discussion of its use in informing building retrofit decisions.},

This study presents a DEEP (database of energy efficiency performance) that provides a direct resource for quick retrofit analysis of commercial buildings. DEEP, compiled from the results of about ten million EnergyPlus simulations, enables an easy screening of ECMs (energy conservation measures) and retrofit analysis. The simulations utilize prototype models representative of small and mid-size offices and retails in California climates. In the formulation of DEEP, large scale EnergyPlus simulations were conducted on high performance computing clusters to evaluate hundreds of individual and packaged ECMs covering envelope, lighting, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, plug-loads, and service hot water. The architecture and simulation environment to create DEEP is flexible and can expand to cover additional building types, additional climates, and new ECMs. In this study DEEP is integrated into a web-based retrofit toolkit, the Commercial Building Energy Saver, which provides a platform for energy retrofit decision making by querying DEEP and unearthing recommended ECMs, their estimated energy savings and financial payback.},

This article reviews literature on this ‘performance gap’. It discerns three main types of gap: (1) between first-principle predictions and measurements, (2) between machine learning and measurements, and (3) between predictions and display certificates in legislation. It presents a pilot study that attempts an initial probabilistic probe into the performance gap. Findings from this pilot study are used to identify a number of key issues that need to be addressed within future investigations of the performance gap in general, especially the fact that the performance gap is a function of time and external conditions. The paper concludes that the performance gap can only be bridged by a broad, coordinated approach that combines model validation and verification, improved data collection for predictions, better forecasting, and change of industry practice.},

It explains differences between energy performance quantification and classifies this energy performance gap as a difference between compliance or performance modelling with measured energy use. Literary sources are reviewed in order to signify the magnitude between predicted and measured energy use, which is found to deviate by +34\% with a standard deviation of 55\% based on 62 buildings. It proceeds in describing the underlying causes for the performance gap, existent in all stages of the building life cycle, and identifies the dominant factors to be related to specification uncertainty in modelling, occupant behaviour and poor operational practices having an estimated effect of 20-60\%, 10-80\% and 15-80\% on energy use respectively. Other factors that have a high impact are related to establishing the energy performance target, impact of early design decisions, heuristic uncertainty in modelling and occupant behaviour. Finally action measures and feedback processes in order to reduce the performance gap are discussed, indicating the need for energy in-use legislation, insight into design stage models, accessible energy data and expansion of research efforts towards building performance in-use in relation to predicted performance},

	abstract = {One of the most discussed issues in the design community is the performance gap. In this research, we investigate for the first time whether part of the gap might be caused by the modelling literacy of design teams. A total of 108 building modellers were asked to comment on the importance of obtaining and using accurate values for 21 common modelling input variables, from U-values to occupancy schedules when using dynamic simulation to estimate annual energy demand. The questioning was based on a real building for which high-resolution energy, occupancy and temperature data were recorded. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted using a model of the building (based on the measured data) by perturbing one parameter in each simulation. The effect of each perturbation on the annual energy consumption given by the model was found and a ranked list generated. The order of this list was then compared to that given by the modellers for the same changes in the parameters. A correlation analysis indicated little correlation between which variables were thought to be important by the modellers and which proved to be objectively important. k-means cluster analysis identified subgroups of modellers and showed that 25\% of the people tested were making judgements that appeared worse than a person responding at random. Follow-up checks showed that higher level qualifications, or having many years of experience in modelling, did not improve the accuracy of people’s predictions. In addition, there was no correlation between modellers, with many ranking some parameters as important that others thought irrelevant. Using a three-part definition of literacy, it is concluded that this sample of modellers, and by implication the population of building modellers, cannot be considered modelling literate. This indicates a new cause of the performance gap. The results suggest a need and an opportunity for both industry and universities to increase their efforts with respect to building physics education, and if this is done, a part of the performance gap could be rapidly closed.},

	abstract = {Sustainable consumption has been addressed from different perspectives in numerous studies. Recently, urban structure-related lifestyle issues have gained more emphasis in the research as cities search for effective strategies to reduce their 80\% share of the global carbon emissions. However, the prevailing belief often seen is that cities would be more sustainable in nature compared to surrounding suburban and rural areas. This paper will illustrate, by studying four different urban structure related lifestyles in Finland, that the situation might be reversed. Actually, substantially more carbon emissions seem to be caused on a per capita level in cities than in suburban and rural areas. This is mainly due to the higher income level in larger urban centers, but even housing-related emissions seem to favor less urbanized areas. The method of the study is a consumption-based life cycle assessment of carbon emissions. In more detail, a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) model, that is comprehensive in providing a full inventory and can accommodate process data, is utilized.},

	abstract = {Internationally, buildings are a major contributor to carbon emissions. Despite significant advances in the technology and construction of energy-efficient buildings, in many cases a performance gap between designed and actual performance exists. While much research has investigated the drivers of the building energy performance gap – both static and transient– there has been considerably less research into the total performance gap, defined here as performance gaps in building energy use, occupant satisfaction and Indoor Environmental Quality parameters such as thermal comfort and air quality which may impact on occupant health and wellbeing. This paper presents a meta-analysis of building performance data from buildings in the UK and China – selected due to their contrasting development environments – which illustrate the presence of and complexities of evaluating total performance gaps in both countries. The data demonstrate the need for (1) high end-use, spatial granularity and temporal resolution data for both energy and Indoor Environmental Quality, and (2) developing methodologies that allow meaningful comparisons between buildings internationally to facilitate learning from successful building design, construction methodologies and policy environments internationally. Using performance data from a UK building, a potential forward path is illustrated with the objective of developing a framework to evaluate total building performance., Practical application: While much research has examined building energy performance gaps, Indoor Environmental Quality and occupant satisfaction gaps are rarely included despite their relationship to energy. We use a meta-analysis of energy, indoor environmental quality, and occupant satisfaction data from buildings in the UK and China to illustrating the presence of and complexities of evaluating total performance gaps for buildings in the two countries, and the need for high resolution dynamic buildings data and novel methodologies for comparison between buildings across different contexts. Illustrative case studies are used to demonstrate potential future directions for evaluating ‘total’ building performance.},

The objective was to verify which strategies of the bioclimatic architecture were applied in the buildings, and also, to propose recommendations for future projects. The methodology consisted of the elaboration of a checklist, from the application of the Mahoney Method and the Brazilian Bioclimatic Zoning, considering Petrolina - PE climate. The checklist was applied in twenty-five packing houses, of three different sizes. It was concluded that the bioclimatic architectural strategies were applied in an isolated way in the buildings. Therefore, the bioclimatic architectural strategies were not effective in the thermal efficiency of the buildings, and the packing houses of small rural producers were the most inappropriate.},

	abstract = {Traditional architectural typologies could play a crucial role in the environmental architectural contemporary framework, due to many attempts developed in last decades to adopt passive house model and bioclimatic criteria in the Mediterranean areas. According to climate responsive approach, the interactive and adaptive relationship between building, site, and climate consider a basic rule to reduce the environmental impact and improving energy efficiency in buildings. In recent decades this concept has extended to the preservation of the cultural identity of the places. High level of adaptive, sustainable and functional performances could be deduced from the traditional residential buildings as the case of Aleppo proves. The traditional Arab house in Aleppo is based on series of adaptive and sustainable-oriented principles derived from the integration of active and interactive design approaches. The old city of Aleppo (included in the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites) is considered one of the largest historical cities in the world, in terms of its population number (110,000 people before the war). The damage to cultural and historical heritage by the war asserts the peculiarity of the city in the Eastern Mediterranean area. This paper presents the study that the authors are carrying out on Aleppo, considering the bioclimatic approach as a key element to reorient the future construction process of the Syrian city to achieve the objectives of global sustainability and identify design criteria’s for the development of the residential buildings. The study also aims to analyse the mutations which appeared through evolution process of residential buildings and identify the invariant elements and the main trajectories of modification established in the past, confirming their compatibility with the future development of Aleppo.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a computational framework for the analysis and optimization of energy systems in neighborhoods and city districts. The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50\% to 80\% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100\% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45\% to 60\% in emissions and from 25\% to 50\% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14\% and 44\% higher than today. For an economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23\% in emissions, 36\% in primary energy and 11\% in costs. We identified close to 15\% in emissions and 20\% in primary energy savings with variable costs between −2\% and 23\% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4\% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts.},

However, given the diverse availability, uncertainty and Level of Details of these data and the resources required to collect them, managing data quality is a common challenge of urban energy modeling. Knowing the influences of the different input data for different configurations and applications enables to control the result accuracy and recommend intelligent and adequate data collecting strategies, by assigning resources on the most important parameters. This paper investigates the influences of geometrical, meteorological, semantic and occupancy related data quality on the heating demand estimated by the urban energy simulation platform SimStadt, applied to the City of Ludwigsburg in Germany. A focus on a district with consumption data available at building block level allows for a critical comparison between estimated and measured energy demands.

	abstract = {Assessing accurately the solar potential of all building surfaces in cities, including shading and multiple reflections between buildings, is essential for urban energy modelling. However, since the number of surface interactions and radiation exchanges increase exponentially with the scale of the district, innovative computational strategies are needed, some of which will be introduced in the present work. They should hold the best compromise between result accuracy and computational efficiency, i.e. computational time and memory requirements. In this study, different approaches that may be used for the computation of urban solar irradiance in large areas are presented. Two concrete urban case studies of different densities have been used to compare and evaluate three different methods: the Perez Sky model, the Simplified Radiosity Algorithm and a new scene tiling method implemented in our urban simulation platform SimStadt, used for feasible estimations on a large scale. To quantify the influence of shading, the new concept of Urban Shading Ratio has been introduced and used for this evaluation process. In high density urban areas, this index may reach 60\% for facades and 25\% for roofs. Tiles of 500m width and 200m overlap are a minimum requirement in this case to compute solar irradiance with an acceptable accuracy. In medium density areas, tiles of 300m width and 100m overlap meet perfectly the accuracy requirements. In addition, the solar potential for various solar energy thresholds as well as the monthly variation of the Urban Shading Ratio have been quantified for both case studies, distinguishing between roofs and facades of different orientations.},

The work tries to identify sources of problems in the workflow of using 3D city models and other data bases such as building physics or usage libraries which can lead to a deviation between simulated and measured demand. Depending on the type of CityGML data, adjustments might be necessary to account for missing terrain intersection curves, for wrong wall or roof attributes etc. Only if the 3D model is of sufficient quality, heating demand simulations can yield realistic values.

Three dimensional city models based on the spatio-semantic data format CityGML offer powerful new methods for the quantitative evaluation of urban energy demand and costs, and simultaneously allow the simulation of renewable energy systems. Such a ‘semantically enriched’ models was used in this work for energy demand diagnostics, refurbishment forecast and renewable supply scenarios. A case study was done using this method in an existing urban quarter in Ludwigsburg/Germany. Based on its three dimensional representation, the photovoltaic potential has been calculated and compared with the electricity demand to establish the photovoltaic fraction. On the thermal side, the passive solar gains were simulated for each building in the city quarter to analyse the solar contribution for heating demand reduction. The simulations were validated with measured gas consumptions. Some rehabilitation scenarios have also been simulated. In such a moderately dense post-war district, the calculated energy savings potential reach in total 65\%, equally distributed between heat savings following building envelope refurbishment, and electricity savings due to the installation of PV on the roofs.},

	abstract = {Retrofitting of existing buildings offers significant opportunities for reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This is being considered as one of main approaches to achieving sustainability in the built environment at relatively low cost and high uptake rates. Although there are a wide range of retrofit technologies readily available, methods to identify the most cost-effective retrofit measures for particular projects is still a major technical challenge. This paper provides a systematic approach to proper selection and identification of the best retrofit options for existing buildings. The generic building retrofit problem and key issues that are involved in building retrofit investment decisions are presented. Major retrofit activities are also briefly discussed, such as energy auditing, building performance assessment, quantification of energy benefits, economic analysis, risk assessment, and measurement and verification (M\&V) of energy savings, all of which are essential to the success of a building retrofit project. An overview of the research and development as well as application of the retrofit technologies in existing buildings is also provided. The aim of this work is to provide building researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of how to effectively conduct a building retrofit to promote energy conservation and sustainability.},

With an increasing focus on energy use of buildings worldwide, this evaluation assumes a fundamental importance. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the available methods for analysing, classifying, benchmarking, rating and evaluating energy performance in non-domestic buildings. Methodologies are grouped in five categories: engineering calculations, simulation, statistical methods, machine learning and other methods. Techniques for evaluating buildings are described, their principal applications are shown and limitations are identified. The use of performance evaluation in energy efficiency programmes and standards is mapped. There is a need to further develop interactions between the main modelling techniques to produce simple, robust and validated models. Also, evaluation techniques must be developed to consider comfort or service provision in the buildings as a factor in energy performance.},

Their categories and criteria have been under constant updates to follow the sustainable trend of building development. This paper aims to develop a systematic review of the development of green rating systems. The specific objectives are: 1) discover how interest and research in green rating systems have developed; 2) identify the similarity, difference, strength and weakness of green rating systems; 3) examine whether they fully assess the projects in all aspects of sustainability. Specifically, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Assessment Method), CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency) and Green Star NZ were analysed in this paper. The results indicate that BREEAM, LEED, and CASBEE have been utilized since late the 2000s while Green Star NZ is still in its earlier stages. 70\% of the research papers focusing on BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE are developed geographically in the USA, Canada, the UK, China, and Australia. Although these four rating systems were initiated in different contexts with different standards, Indoor Environment Quality, Energy, and Material are core common categories for all. Environmental concerns are the main focus in New Construction manuals while Society is emphasized in Neighbourhood Development manuals. Currently, BREEAM has been the only tool which could assess all four sustainable factors. Further in-depth research is anticipated to focus more on economic and institutional factors to improve the capability of green rating systems for sustainability assessment purposes.},

Twenty-one of these office buildings were identified as LEED-certified, providing the opportunity for direct comparison of energy performance data for LEED and non-LEED buildings of the same type, time frame, and geographical and climate region. With regard to energy consumption and GHG emission the LEED-certified buildings, collectively, showed no savings as compared with non-LEED buildings. The subset of the LEED buildings certified at the Gold level outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20\%. In contrast LEED Silver and Certified office buildings underperformed other NYC office buildings. The average EPR for the LEED buildings was 78, 10 pts higher than that for all NYC office buildings, raising questions about the validity and interpretation of these EPR's. This work suggests that LEED building certification is not moving NYC toward its goal of climate neutrality. The results also suggest the need to re-examine some aspects of ENERGY STAR's benchmarking tool.},

As a result, BEPS model inputs can vary widely from this time consuming, non-standardised and subjective process. This paper proposes a standardised method of information exchange between Building Information Modelling (BIM) and BEPS tools using the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and Model View Definition (MVD) methodologies. The methodology leverages a collection of use cases to initiate the identification of exchange requirements needed by BEPS tools. The IDM/MVD framework captures and translates exchange requirements into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema. The suggested approach aims to facilitate the transfer of information from IFC based BIM to either conventional or advanced BEPS tools (e.g. EnergyPlus and Modelica) through the development of a specific MVD that defines a subset of the IFC data model that deals with building energy performance simulation. By doing so, the potential of BIM-based simulation can be fully unlocked, and a reliable and consistent IFC subset is provided as an input for energy simulation software.},

	abstract = {Steadily increasing use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in all phases of building's lifecycle, together with more attention for openBIM and growing software support for the most recent version of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC 4) have created a very promising context for an even broader application of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS). At the same time, an urgent need for modeling guidelines and standardization becomes evident. A well-defined BIM-based workflow and a set of tools that fully exploit and extend the possibilities of the openBIM-technology can make the difference when it comes to reliability and cost of BEPS to design, build and operate high-performance buildings. This paper describes the essential elements of this integrated workflow, explains why openBIM comprises much more than just a standardized file-format and what is achieved with the already available technology, namely the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and a newly developed Model View Definition. This MVD is tailored to the needs of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) that uses the Modelica language together with a specific library (IDEAS) and can easily be adapted to other libraries. In this project, several tools have been developed to closely integrate BEPS and IFC4. The simulation engine now gets the vast majority of the required input directly from the IFC4-file. For the implementation of the tools, the PYTHON language and the open source library IfcOpenShell are used. A case study is presented, that was used for extensive tests of the proposed approach and the implemented tools. The essential benefits of this new workflow are illustrated, and the feasibility is demonstrated. Opportunities and remaining bottlenecks are identified to encourage further development of BIM software to fully support IFC4 as an information source for BEPS. Besides some improvements of the proprietary class structure and functionality, enabling the export of IFC4 files based on custom MVDs is one required key feature.},

Consolidation of independently collected and maintained datasets presents a cost-effective opportunity to build a database of unprecedented size. Applications of the data include peer group analysis to evaluate building performance, and data-driven algorithms that use empirical data to estimate energy savings associated with building retroﬁts. This paper discusses technical considerations in compiling such a database using the DOE Buildings Performance Database (BPD) as a case study. We gathered data on over 750,000 residential and commercial buildings. We describe the process and challenges of mapping and cleansing data from disparate sources. We analyze the distributions of buildings in the BPD relative to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), evaluating peer groups of buildings that are well or poorly represented, and discussing how differences in the distributions of the three datasets impact use-cases of the data. Finally, we discuss the usefulness and limitations of the current dataset and the outlook for increasing its size and applications.},

Selected performance ‘failures’ that became evident during operation of CIRS are studied for how they were discovered and the efforts required for their resolution: the energy systems and associated controls and monitoring. The key ﬁndings show the barriers were neither economic nor technical. Instead, the primary impediments were institutional regimes –arising from the ways that various life-cycle stages were speciﬁed, contracted and implemented. The key issues emphasize the importance of having meaningful and effective building energy monitoring capabilities, an understanding of energy system boundaries in design and analysis, crossing the gaps between different stages of a building life cycle, and feedback processes throughout design and operation. The disclosure of ‘failure’ and lessons learned is a valuable contribution to subsequent advancement for the building stakeholders and the wider professional and research communities.},

A large proportion of this energy is used for thermal comfort in buildings. This paper reviews thermal comfort research work and discusses the implications for building energy efﬁciency. Predicted mean vote works well in air-conditioned spaces but not naturally ventilated buildings, whereas adaptive models tend to have a broader comfort temperature ranges. Higher indoor temperatures in summertime conditions would lead to less prevalence of cooling systems as well as less cooling requirements. Raising summer set point temperature has good energy saving potential, in that it can be applied to both new and existing buildings. Further research and development work conducive to a better understanding of thermal comfort and energy conservation in buildings have been identiﬁed and discussed. These include (i) social-economic and cultural studies in general and post-occupancy evaluation of the built environment and the corresponding energy use in particular, and (ii) consideration of future climate scenarios in the analysis of co- and tri-generation schemes for HVAC applications, fuel mix and the associated energy planning/distribution systems in response to the expected changes in heating and cooling requirements due to climate change.},

	abstract = {Internationally, buildings are a major contributor to carbon emissions. Despite significant advances in the technology and construction of energy-efficient buildings, in many cases a performance gap between designed and actual performance exists. While much research has investigated the drivers of the building energy performance gap – both static and transient– there has been considerably less research into the total performance gap, defined here as performance gaps in building energy use, occupant satisfaction and Indoor Environmental Quality parameters such as thermal comfort and air quality which may impact on occupant health and wellbeing. This paper presents a meta-analysis of building performance data from buildings in the UK and China – selected due to their contrasting development environments – which illustrate the presence of and complexities of evaluating total performance gaps in both countries. The data demonstrate the need for (1) high end-use, spatial granularity and temporal resolution data for both energy and Indoor Environmental Quality, and (2) developing methodologies that allow meaningful comparisons between buildings internationally to facilitate learning from successful building design, construction methodologies and policy environments internationally. Using performance data from a UK building, a potential forward path is illustrated with the objective of developing a framework to evaluate total building performance., Practical application: While much research has examined building energy performance gaps, Indoor Environmental Quality and occupant satisfaction gaps are rarely included despite their relationship to energy. We use a meta-analysis of energy, indoor environmental quality, and occupant satisfaction data from buildings in the UK and China to illustrating the presence of and complexities of evaluating total performance gaps for buildings in the two countries, and the need for high resolution dynamic buildings data and novel methodologies for comparison between buildings across different contexts. Illustrative case studies are used to demonstrate potential future directions for evaluating ‘total’ building performance.},

	abstract = {Very often, building managers face the challenge of having to operate a building in the absence of the appropriate information about how it should function. This problem is one of the many reasons why buildings operate inefficiently and tend to consume excessive amounts of energy. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an emerging technology which addresses the management of information throughout the Building Life-Cycle (BLC). Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is a non-proprietary data model of BIM that enables effective data integration over the BLC. IFC is a rich data model which may represent the entire building, however most applications are interested in a subset of this model. Hence, it is necessary to filter the information exchange between different applications and Model View Definitions (MVD) is the methodology to define such subsets. This paper presents the development of a MVD for environmental and energy performance assessment to support building managers during operation.},

	abstract = {The road towards achievement of the climate protection goals requires, among the rest, a thorough rethinking of the energy planning tools (and policies) at all levels, from local to global. Nevertheless, it is in the cities where the largest part of energy is produced and consumed, and therefore it makes sense to focus the attention particularly on the cities as they yield great potentials in terms of energy consumption reduction and efficiency increase. As a direct consequence, a comprehensive knowledge of the demand and supply of energy resources, including their spatial distribution within urban areas, is therefore of utmost importance. Precise, integrated knowledge about 3D urban space, i.e. all urban (above and underground) features, infrastructures, their functional and semantic characteristics, and their mutual dependencies and interrelations play a relevant role for advanced simulation and analyses. As a matter of fact, what in the last years has proven to be an emerging and effective approach is the adoption of standard-based, integrated semantic 3D virtual city models, which represent an information hub for most of the abovementioned needs. In particular, being based on open standards (e.g. on the CityGML standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium), virtual city models firstly reduce the effort in terms of data preparation and provision. Secondly, they offer clear data structures, ontologies and semantics to facilitate data exchange between different domains and applications. However, a standardised and omni-comprehensive urban data model covering also the energy domain is still missing at the time of writing (January 2018). Even CityGML falls partially short when it comes to the definition of specific entities and attributes for energy-related applications. Nevertheless, and starting from the current version of CityGML (i.e. 2.0), this article describes the conception and the definition of an Energy Application Domain Extension (ADE) for CityGML. The Energy ADE is meant to offer a unique and standard-based data model to fill, on one hand, the above-mentioned gap, and, on the other hand, to allow for both detailed single-building energy simulation (based on sophisticated models for building physics and occupant behaviour) and city-wide, bottom-up energy assessments, with particular focus on the buildings sector. The overall goal is to tackle the existing data interoperability issues when dealing with energy-related applications at urban scale. The article presents the rationale behind the Energy ADE, it describes its main characteristics, the relation to other standards, and provides some examples of current applications and case studies already adopting it.},

This is due to the current limitations of energy modeling at the urban scale and the inconsistency between the available urban data and that required for modeling. The chapter seeks to fill this gap by developing a GIS-based urban building energy modeling system, using the Urban-EPC simulation engine, a modified Energy Performance Calculator engine. This modeling
system is compatible with other planning tools, enhanced by the combination of physical and statistical modeling, and adjustable in its resolution, speed and accuracy. Through processing the Data Preparation, Pre-Simulation, Main Simulation and Visualization and Analysis models in this energy modeling system, the urban data related to the basic building information, mutual shading, microclimate and occupant behavior are collected, modified, and synthesized in the GIS platform and then used as the input of the Urban-EPC engine to get energy use of every building in a city, which could be further visualized and analyzed. The method is applied in Manhattan to show its potential as an important component in PSS to inform urban energy policy making.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a socio-technical building performance evaluation (BPE) approach to assess the pre- and post- actual performance of two discrete deep low energy retroﬁts in the UK – a Victorian solid-wall house and modern 1990s cavity-wall house. A ‘low-energy ﬁrst, then low-carbon’ approach was adopted in both cases, to achieve an 80\% reduction in annual CO2 emissions. Pre-retroﬁt, both houses had lower measured annual gas consumption as compared to predictions made by energy models, although the electricity consumption in the modern house was higher than modelled, due to occupancy pattern and occupant behaviour. Post-retroﬁt, it was found that the Victorian house achieved nearly 75\% CO2 reduction, while the modern house achieved only 57\% CO2 reduction over the baseline emissions. Key reasons were higher than expected air permeability rates, installation issues with micro-renewable systems, lack of proper commissioning, usability of controls, occupant preferences and behaviour. Despite the gap between expected and actual carbon emissions, occupant comfort and satisfaction was signiﬁcantly improved across both retroﬁts. This evidence-based understanding of the process and outcomes of deep low carbon retroﬁts is vital not only for learning and innovation, but also for scaling-up deep retroﬁt programmes for meeting national and international carbon targets.},

By utilizing data from the Norwegian housing market, we reproduce the positive price premium effect found in earlier studies. However, when we check these results by taking advantage of the fact that the introduction of a mandatory energy certification system represents a quasi-natural experiment, we find no evidence of a price premium.

By services, one means usually: illumination, sustenance (by way of food preparation), communication (by way of information technology services), and thermal comfort. In the building simulation environment, however, these services are commonly represented through annual transient profiles of internal heat gains, electricity loads, and set point temperatures. The intended capability of DELORES is to stochastically generate such profiles for use in common building energy models, such as TRNSYS and EnergyPlus, and do so whilst presenting users with a straight-forward, easy-to-use interface. By furthering the dissemination of this tool in the public domain, and encouraging it is future development, it is hoped that multidisciplinary research related to stochastic occupant behaviour and energy demand will become an easier task.},

The internal loads are inextricably linked to occupant behaviour, both directly through the contribution of occupant heat output to thermal energy balance and indirectly via the interactions between occupants, appliances and building services. While occupancy itself is difficult to measure directly, most buildings possess a wealth of data in the form of monitored electricity consumption in varying degrees of resolution. These data, particularly plug loads, may be used to inform the model of occupant-related internal loads. Different approaches to parameterisation of plug loads have been investigated, with the purpose of exploring the conditions that might lead to preference of one approach over another. The models have been tested through a case study and simulation results have been compared against a range of response variables. Conclusions have been drawn as to the most important features of plug load parameterisation for a model to be used for forecasting future demand.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption models play an integral part in energy management and conservation, as it pertains to buildings. It can assist in evaluating building energy efficiency, in carrying out building commissioning, and in identifying and diagnosing building system faults. This review takes an in-depth look at energy-demand prediction models for buildings in that it delves into recent developments in building energy approaches used to predict energy usage. By enlisting current approaches to the modelling of buildings, methods for building energy simulations can be categorized into four level classes as follows: (i) data-driven approaches; (ii) physics-based approaches; (iii) large scale building energy forecasting approaches; and (iv) hybrid approaches. The focus of this review is to target the data-driven approach and large-scale building energy predicting-based approaches. Here the data driven approaches can be categorized by (1) artificial neural network based approaches; (2) clustering based approaches; (3) statistical and machine learning-based approaches; and (4) support vector machine based approaches. From there, the type of data-driven based approach is further grouped by (a) benchmarking models; (b) energy-mapping models; (c) energy forecasting models; and (d) energy profiling models. Large-scale building-energy prediction techniques is then categorized as follows: (1) white-box based approaches; (2) black-box based approaches, and (3) grey-box based approaches. The current study explores first-rate data-driven based approaches about building energy analysis for industrial, commercial, domestic, etc., within a rural and urban setting. This review paper is based on the necessity of identifying points of departure and research opportunities for urban and rural-level analyses of building level energy performance. A variety of issues are explored which include: energy performance metrics; end-use of different building types; multiple levels of granularity; and urban and rural scales. Each technique encompasses a variety of input information as well as varying calculations or simulation models along with furnishing contrasting outcomes that suggest a variety of usages. A thorough review of each technique is presented in this study. This review highlights strengths, shortcomings, and purpose of the methods of numerous data-mining based approaches. A comprehensive review of energy forecasting models that are specified in the literature part is also provided.},

Test results showed that females consistently felt warmer and more uncomfortable than males under the same conditions. Test results showed that metabolic rate has more a pronounced effect on thermal comfort than does room temperature for transient and high metabolic rate conditions. Test results also showed that neutral temperatures in which people felt neither cool nor warm were 26.4°C (79.5°F) for males and 23.9°C (75°F) for females. Consecutive exercise sessions during the tests showed that male thermal sensation has a linear increase in time, whereas female thermal sensation increases earlier than males resulting, in less tolerance towards the warm conditions.},

	abstract = {Of the six fundamental parameters in the classic heat balance model of human thermal comfort, metabolic rate is probably the most important and yet it is the most crudely assessed in both research and practice. Most studies in thermal comfort domain to date have relied on simple activity diaries to estimate metabolic rate. To better understand the pros and cons of this convenient approach, a literature review of cognate disciplines was conducted with the aim of transferring developments in human metabolic science to the built environmental context. This review leads to the conclusion that the dairy methods prevalent in thermal comfort research and practice are probably not accurate enough to sustain common thermal comfort modeling with any semblance of precision. Additional research effort is needed to develop better metabolic rate estimation methods for building occupants, especially accommodating individual differences in BMI, sex, age, pregnancy and menopause status, and non-steady state scenarios. In particular, three avenues of future research topics hold promise for improving practical metabolic estimation and thermal comfort in buildings were discussed:1) development and validation of new metabolic rate instrumentation, 2) field measurement of human metabolic rate characteristics, 3) determine comfort zones for buildings with specific metabolic rate features.},

	url = {https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0340680},
	abstract = {Increasing urbanization has caused a corresponding increase in energy consumption from the design, construction and operation of the built environment. To achieve energy-efficient design in urban communities, the design phase needs to adopt reliable energy modeling approaches. However, current urban modeling approaches often use abstract and low level information to describe buildings because of the difficulties of collecting and managing building data on the large scale required of such urban communities. This abstraction of building data creates large uncertainties in the modeling and simulation of energy scenarios at the community level. An additional consequence is a general separation between community energy design (with low level building information) and building energy design (with high level building information). An important part of the solution to this challenge relies on the integration of information systems at the scale of both urban communities and individual buildings, which are based on Geographic Information System (GIS) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) respectively. Since current technologies do not sufficiently address the interoperability between GIS and BIM, the existing conversion between GIS and BIM does not satisfy the data requirements for community energy design. This thesis investigates this challenge and presents an approach that uses Semantic Web technologies, including OWL (Web Ontology Language) and RDF (Resource Description Framework), to integrate GIS and BIM data. In this approach, we first develop relevant design scenarios for energy consumption in buildings of the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus. Based on the scenarios and required information for the energy simulation, we create a suitable ontology to transform the data into a Semantic Web model. Then we conduct relevant queries on the transformed data to provide the required information for energy simulation of a UBC campus neighborhood that contains richer and more detailed building information that is extracted from the campus building information models. Finally, we visualize the simulation results in a three-dimensional environment and discuss how it supports designers and decision makers engaged in community planning and design.},

The stochastic model to predict activity chains is calibrated using French time-use survey data (of 1998/1999), based on three types of time-dependent quantities: (i) the probability to be at home, (ii) the conditional probability to start an activity whilst being at home, and (iii) the probability distribution function for the duration of that activity. The behaviour of the individual agents in the model is first calibrated using a generic approach, where every individual is assumed to behave the same. A refinement is then presented to account for variations in the behaviours of sub-populations, having specific individual characteristics. Furthermore, a statistical approach is introduced for the modelling of transitions between two successive activity types as a Markov process. The models are then validated using a cross-validation technique, and their predictive performance is compared at an individual level, as well as for aggregated (sub-)populations.

If the desired wind speed is accessible in several directions, additional wind towers can be installed in several positions. The proposed wind tower can also rotate and set itself in the direction of the maximum wind speed. In the regions where the wind speed is low, to improve the efficiency of the system a solar chimney or a one-sided wind tower can be installed in another part of the building in the opposite direction. Using transparent materials in the manufacturing of the proposed wind towers improves the use of natural light inside the building. The major advantage of wind towers is that they are passive systems requiring no energy for operation. Also, wind towers reduce electrical energy consumption and environmental pollution.},

	abstract = {The sustainability of the built environment involves efficient performance of all related systems, including the water system. The way water is consumed in urban areas is proven to be inefficient and unsustainable. Although the green building industry has taken profound steps to reduce water footprints in the built environment, a significant gap is observed in predicted and actual performance of water systems in some green awarded projects. Therefore, this thesis aims to review, question and redefine water systems on paper and in practice of green building in the University of British Columbia (UBC) Vancouver campus. Water strategies within current green building practice are studied to find the performance gaps. The Center for Interactive Research of Sustainability (CIRS) building was researched as a case study through different lenses of academics, planners, designers, builders and operators, who were involved with this project.
This research finds a number of successes and areas for improvement in water strategies of the CIRS project. The performance gaps are due to a lack of a comprehensive water plan for UBC, policies and incentives for water pricing, and not engaging all stakeholders in early stages of the process. Finally, this research recommends improving campus-wide water policies and plans and enhancing collaboration and integration throughout all phases of building projects. These strategies can bridge the gap between theory and practice of water systems in future green building projects at UBC.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years a number of studies have identified and provided explanations for a significant ‘performance gap' between designed and actual energy performance of buildings. The anticipated and achieved energy performance of an advanced, innovative building that aspired to net-positive energy performance is studied: the Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) building at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Selected performance ‘failures’ that became evident during operation of CIRS are studied for how they were discovered and the efforts required for their resolution: the energy systems and associated controls and monitoring. The key findings show the barriers were neither economic nor technical. Instead, the primary impediments were institutional regimes – arising from the ways that various life-cycle stages were specified, contracted and implemented. The key issues emphasize the importance of having meaningful and effective building energy monitoring capabilities, an understanding of energy system boundaries in design and analysis, crossing the gaps between different stages of a building life cycle, and feedback processes throughout design and operation. The disclosure of ‘failure’ and lessons learned is a valuable contribution to subsequent advancement for the building stakeholders and the wider professional and research communities.},

The policy and regulatory context for the building industry is examined in relation to the policy context for solutions and recommendations that will work for all parties. Based on this analysis, two substantive recommendations are made for improved policy design. Firstly, a decoupling of policy objectives and policy mechanisms is needed so that the policy-taking stakeholders (in design, development and construction) can reduce energy use in buildings more effectively. Secondly, policy-taking stakeholders need an explicit and diverse system in order to advocate for policy objectives. The major aspect of this work is the development of a new conceptual framework that ties together these recommendations into a continuous process of policy-making and policy-taking. This framework demonstrates an idealized system that operates simultaneously top down and bottom up, and the development of policy objectives is influenced by stakeholders of all kinds to further the goals of an energy-efficient, low-carbon built environment.},

In systems language, the concern is with the atmospheric process-response system of energy and matter flows within the biosphere.

Amongst the more readily recognizable study areas under the bioclimatolog­ that investigate the effects of atmospheric variation and ical umbrella are those variability upon 1. Terrestrial and aquatic ecology (zoological, botanical and ethological), natural resource production and management (including silviculture, agri­ culture, horticulture, and grassland, wetland, and marine systems). 2.

How do these interrelated questions offer new vantage points on the architectural ramiﬁcations of climate change at the interfaces between resiliency, sustainability and eco-technology? New approaches to understanding climate in architecture based on research as well as the work of leading practitioners make this forward-thinking book invaluable.

Twenty-one of these office buildings were identified as LEED-certified, providing the opportunity for direct comparison of energy performance data for LEED and non-LEED buildings of the same type, time frame, and geographical and climate region. With regard to energy consumption and GHG emission the LEED-certified buildings, collectively, showed no savings as compared with non-LEED buildings. The subset of the LEED buildings certified at the Gold level outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20\%. In contrast LEED Silver and Certified office buildings underperformed other NYC office buildings. The average EPR for the LEED buildings was 78, 10 pts higher than that for all NYC office buildings, raising questions about the validity and interpretation of these EPR's. This work suggests that LEED building certification is not moving NYC toward its goal of climate neutrality. The results also suggest the need to re-examine some aspects of ENERGY STAR's benchmarking tool.},

Furthermore, with the increasing demand for energy efficiency, the AEC industry requires an expeditious energy retrofit of the existing building stock to successfully achieve the 2020 Energy Strategy targets. As such, this article seeks to survey the recent developments in the energy efficiency of buildings, combining energy retrofitting and the technological capabilities of BIM, providing a critical exposition in both engineering and energy domains. The result is a thorough review of the work done by other authors in relevant fields, comprising the entire spectrum from on-site data acquisition, through the generation of Building Energy Models (BEM), data transfer to energy analysis software and, finally, the identification of major issues throughout this process. Additionally, a BIM-based methodology centered on the acquired knowledge is presented. Solutions for as-built data acquisition such as laser scanning and infrared thermography, and on-site energy tests that benefit the acquisition of energy-related data are explored. The most predominant BIM software regarding not only energy analysis but also model development is examined. In addition, interoperability restrictions between BIM and energy analysis software are addressed using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and Green Building Extensible Markup Language (gbXML) schemes. Lastly, the article argues the future innovations in this subject, predicting future trends and challenges for the industry.},

The aim of this paper is thus to facilitate collaborative work between the two processes of urban-level energy planning and building-level energy design by adopt-ing a holistic energy design approach. This paper develops a BIM-GIS integrated web-based building energy data visualization system. The use of this system contextualizes low energy building design in the urban energy landscape.

Despite the many benefits associated with retrofit projects, they are still only slowly being implemented because of the many challenges that exist. One of these challenges is optimizing the decision between renovation scenarios based on economic and environmental goals, which can be made possible with an accurate pre-retrofit model. The intention of this paper is to introduce a pre-retrofit model that efficiently obtains and integrates multiple forms of building data as a critical step to develop a comprehensive understanding of a building to be renovated. Opportunities for utilizing building information modeling (BIM) and geographical information systems (GIS) for retrofitting projects were explored through the study of a historical campus building. With the use of as-is geometric data and as-is data, building data maps were obtained. The next step of this study is to use the model to conduct scenarios comparison and optimize renovation decision based on economic and environmental goals.},

	abstract = {The industrial sector accounts for 17\% of end-use energy in the United Kingdom, and 54\% globally. Therefore, there is substantial scope to accurately simulate and efficiently assess potential energy retrofit options for industrial buildings to lower end use energy. Due to potentially years of facility renovation and expansion Building Energy Modelling, also called Building Energy Simulation, applied to industrial buildings poses a complex challenge; but it is an important opportunity for reducing global energy demand especially considering the increase of readily available computational power compared with a few years ago. Large and complex industrial buildings make modelling existing geometry for Building Energy Modelling difficult and time consuming which impacts analysis workflow and assessment options available within reasonable budgets. This research presents a potential framework for quickly capturing and processing as-built geometry of a factory, or other large scale buildings, to be utilised in Building Energy Modelling by storing the geometry in a green building eXtensible Mark-up Language (gbXML) format, which is compatible with most commercially available Building Energy Modelling tools. Laser scans were captured from the interior of an industrial facility to produce a Point Cloud. The existing capabilities of a Point Cloud processing software and previous research were assessed to identify the potential development opportunities to automate the conversion of Point Clouds to building geometry for Building Energy Modelling applications. This led to the novel identification of a framework for storing the building geometry in the gbXML format and plans for verification of a future Point Cloud processing solution. This resulted in a sample Point Cloud, of a portion of a building, being converted into a gbXML model that met the validation requirements of the gbXML definition schema. In conclusion, an opportunity exists for increasing the speed of 3D geometry creation of existing industrial buildings for application in BEM and subsequent thermal simulation.},

	abstract = {Buildings contribute to about 40\% of total annual energy consumption in the U.S. and saving a small percentage of that can lead to significant economic and environmental impacts. Building Energy Modeling (BEM) tools are important in reducing building's energy consumption. Most of the available tools only provide total energy consumption related to HVAC system, lighting, hot water, and appliances. While fine-grained data may be available in some computer tools, the process for obtaining these data is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires software-related skills. This paper explains a developed tool that contributes in automation of building energy simulation and providing fine-grained outputs by using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and modified source code of energy simulation tools such as EnergyPlus and OpenStudio. This tool, which is referred to as ABEMAT (Automated Building Energy Modeling and Assessment Tool), receives gbXML file and provides users with the amount of heat transfer through every single building envelope component such as windows, doors, and walls through an automated process. ABEMAT's and EnergyPlus advanced outputs are compared for validation; the latter being a time consuming process and error-prone, which requires software-related skills compared to ABEMAT. Results showed similar findings indicating the functionality of ABEMAT in providing fine-grained outputs.},

It is essential for urban planners to provide innovative solutions in context of urban energy simulation based on virtual 3D city models. The recent 3D geoinformation science studies are insufficient in providing optimal solutions because of lack of emerging concepts and integrated softwares. Presently 3D GIS data can be generated into various LODs (Levels of Detail) depending upon the application requirement and input data used. There are various 3D GIS softwares like Google SketchUp, ESRI CityEngine etc., which are being used mostly for data creation especially for boundary representation for geometry abstraction without semantic information. The 3D GIS data conversion from native format into City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) enhances it by providing information both at geometric and at semantic level in interoperable format. A building information model of Geoinformatics department building in IIRS campus is created using Google SketchUp and exported to energy modelling program in gbXML schema. The present investigation explores the semantic characteristics of developed CityGML model for solar thermal and photovoltaic energy production potential assessment based on building semantic components. The amount of solar irradiation incident on bounding features and also illumination obtained through openings of building is quantized using SunCast and RadianceIES application of IESVE Software, respectively. The simulated energy data are integrated with building semantic features and stored in open-source PostGIS RDBMS to address basic semantic queries.},

	abstract = {Research on digitizing the various aspects of a typical building project has been on the increase since the advent of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Most efforts build on information technology capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a BIM environment is therefore proposed. A prototype illustrating the framework is implemented in. NET framework interfaced with a BIM-enabled tool and tested in the refinement of a pre-designed school using data from the operations phase of another school delivered previously. We conclude that the framework developed in this research can contribute to bridging existing gaps between the design, construction and operation phases of a building's life-cycle.},

Danish homeowners’ experiences with the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) are examined, as it was introduced in 1997 (prior to a similar scheme introduced later in the European Union). The main research question is whether the EPC has an influence on Danish homeowners’ energy retrofit practices. Homeowners’ understanding of and trust in the EPC are analyzed, based on an online survey of homeowners (N = 743) living in a home with a recently issued EPC. Results indicate that the EPC has a limited influence on homeowners’ energy retrofit practices. Despite most homeowners finding the EPC reliable and easy to understand, relatively few find it useful as a source of information for home retrofits. In its current form, the EPC is insufficient to encourage homeowners to undertake energy retrofits of their home. Improvements to address this problem in the administration, scope and layout of the EPC are suggested.},

The envelope components considered for retrofit are windows, walls and roof. Installation of a PV power supply system is also built into the optimization model in view of the rich solar resource in South Africa. An additional objective of this study is to obtain at least a grade D rating from the established energy performance certificate (EPC) program in South Africa to ensure the continued suitability of the building with respect of the EPC standard and green building policy. A case study of a public office building in South Africa is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and benefits of the model presented.},

	abstract = {The building sector accounts for about 40\% of the final energy consumption in Germany. At the same time, the sector is regarded as one of the most cost-effective options for saving CO2 emissions. To target this potential, the European Union introduced energy performance certificates (EPC). EPCs should provide clear information about the energy performance of buildings to building purchasers, owners and tenants. This study analyses, in how far EPCs have helped purchasers of owner-occupied dwellings in Germany to incorporate energy efficiency in their purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the effectiveness of EPCs is limited. Main reasons are first, that the certificates are not helpful for understanding the financial implications of energy efficiency. Second, EPCs are not viewed for most buildings due to their legal status. Third, energy efficiency is only a minor purchasing criterion for dwelling purchases. The results of the study however also point to the potential of EPCs, as these barriers can be removed. From 2013 onwards the use of the EPC will be increased due to the new EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). Changes to the design of the EPC could further increase the importance of energy performance certificates and of energy efficiency.},

Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of “green” voters during the 2006 national elections. Within the sample of labeled homes, the energy label creates transparency in the energy efficiency of dwellings. Our analysis shows that consumers capitalize this information into the price of their prospective homes.},

Now that the EPC has been implemented for several years it is possible to examine its impact. This research draws on data from ex-ante and ex-post assessments of the EPC in a number of countries and presents the results of a survey of Dutch private dwelling purchasers. This survey was based on two sample populations, one received an EPC during property transaction and another did not. Differences were sought between the two samples in a number of areas relating to the adoption of energy efficiency measures. Results show that many projections about the impact of the EPC have fallen short. The EPC was found to have a weak influence, especially pre-purchase. The potential of the EPC in driving energy efficiency improvement in the existing stock is doubted especially if it continues to act independent from a mix of instruments designed to tackle multiple barriers. It is argued that the energy saving potential of existing dwellings, applauded in climate change policy, will remain unexploited if it continues to be assessed subjectively by householders.},

In cooperation with a large online retailer in Switzerland we assess the impact of the EU Energy Label and of a newly designed monetary lifetime-oriented energy label in the field. We analyze private purchases of household appliances, especially freezers, vacuum cleaners and tumble dryers. We find that the display of any of the two energy labels increases the sales proportion of energy-efficient appliances compared to the absence of any energy label. At the same time, we observe a volume-effect for freezers: The average size of purchased freezers is larger when any of the two energy labels is displayed compared to the absence of any energy label. The influence of the two different energy labels is similar except for vacuum cleaners, for which monetary information might have an adverse effect.},

Data-driven approach and first-principle approach are two commonly used methods in developing models for predicting building energy use. In this paper, several data-driven methods including multiple linear regression, adaptive linear filter algorithms (least mean square (LMS), normalized least mean square (nLMS), and recursive least square (RLS)), and Gaussian mixture model regression (GMMR) are employed to predict hourly energy usages in two buildings. One building is a synthetic large-size office building from DOE reference building models. The hourly building energy consumption was predicted using the energy simulation model for one year under Chicago climate. The other building is an existing office building located in Des Moines, Iowa. The actual hourly building energy consumption of the existing building was obtained through building submeters. The accuracies of these data-driven models for predicting energy usages of the two buildings are compared. The GMMR models outperform the adaptive filter methods in this study. Both the GMMR and adaptive filter methods meet the model calibration criteria defined by the ASHRAE Guideline 14.},

The review results demonstrate that the data-driven approaches have well addressed a large variety of building energy related applications, such as load forecasting and prediction, energy pattern profiling, regional energy-consumption mapping, benchmarking for building stocks, global retrofit strategies and guideline making etc. Significantly, this review refines a few key tasks for modification of the data-driven approaches in the context of application to building energy analysis. The conclusions drawn in this review could facilitate future micro-scale changes of energy use for a particular building through the appropriate retrofit and the inclusion of renewable energy technologies.

	abstract = {One of the alternatives to reduce building energy consumption recognized and used internationally is establishing standards for the evaluation and classification of buildings in terms of energy performance. In developed countries, the introduction of energy efficiency codes for residential and non-residential buildings started around the time of the first oil crisis in the mid-70s. Ten years later, Brazil has started implemented measures aimed at the conservation and rational use of energy. Initiatives in this regard began with the implementation of the Brazilian Labeling Program, where consumers are provided with information on the energy efficiency of appliances. However, the first energy efficiency law stimulated the most notable improvement in energy efficiency in 2001 after national energy crisis. As a result, the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labeling of Commercial, Service and Public Buildings (RTQ-C) was released in February 2009 and the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labeling of Residential Buildings (RTQ-R) was released in November 2010. Nowadays, the labeling of residential, commercial and service buildings is voluntary and the labeling of federal public buildings is mandatory since 2014. This paper presents a review of the building energy efficiency codes and labeling schemes all over the world, an overview of the Brazilian regulations on energy efficiency and discusses the labeling scheme for residential buildings adopted in Brazil. The process of its implementation, strengths and weaknesses in the present labeling scheme and the similarities and differences in relation to international experiences are described. The results obtained to date indicate that a revision is required in order to achieve a more flexible and economically viable process that will enable the program to be established as compulsory.},

This paper aims to assess how Brazilian RTQ-C could learn from the European Union (EU)’s experience of implementing the Directive 2010/31/EU. The implementation of the RTQ-C in Brazil has been examined and compared with the EU's Directive. Technical, economic and social issues as well as barriers and challenges behind the initial stage of the Directive 2010/31/EU implementation were examined. The difficulties and weaknesses of the calculation methodology, scope and labelling of the Brazilian RTQ-C regulations, and potential areas that require further research have been identified and summarised. In order to increase the impact of RTQ-C regulations, improvements to the existing calculation methodology and tools, provision of numerous supporting measures, such as an increase in training, education, public awareness and incentives, and enforcement through building regulations or standards are essential. The valuable experience from the EU's implementation of the Directive could be used to guide the development of energy policies and certification regulations in Brazil.},
