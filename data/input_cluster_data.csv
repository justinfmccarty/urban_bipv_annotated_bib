0,017-218-924-758-129,Trade-off between environmental and economic implications of PV systems integrated into the UAE residential sector,2012,"PV technology offers clean resource and environmental advantages over fossil-fuel-based electricity generation; however, it remains more expensive than conventional technology in most grid-connected applications. The trade-off between environmental and economic parameters represents a challenge for governments. The objectives of this study are: firstly, to review studies in relation to the use of PV systems in the Gulf region and secondly, to assess the trade-off between environmental and economic parameters that influence the value of building integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) technology applied into the UAE building sector. This work examines residential buildings and concludes that the economic viability of BiPV systems is subject to capital cost, system efficiency and electricity tariff. To be a cost-effective option in the UAE, subsidies for PV investments and reasonable electricity tariff must be implemented. It is suggested that BiPV systems offer cost reductions in both energy and economic terms over centralised PV plants, especially if the costs of saved operating energy and avoided building materials are taken into account. Each square meter of BiPV is capable of making a significant reduction in CO2 emissions generated by conventional power plants. This will limit the impact of global warming on the UAE and others.",Environmental resource management; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Environmental economics; Economic cost; Capital cost; Electricity; Tariff; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Subsidy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.048,journal article,United Arab Emirates University,ae
1,025-264-529-973-31X,Analysis of cooling load on commercial building in UAE climate using building integrated photovoltaic facade system,2020,"Abstract In this study the details of energy consumption and its cost were studied and analyzed for a commercial office building in United Arab Emirates (UAE) as hot, dry and humid region where the cooling load is very high. Two different cases were simulated namely (a) base case without photovoltaic (PV) with normal glass windows (b) building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facade system with transparent PV windows. The building size, space layout, dimensions, shape and orientation for both cases were exactly the same. The PVSYST software was used to determine the best orientation for BIPV facade system installation to minimize the cooling load and maximize the electrical energy production. The amorphous silicon thin film was used for case (b) along with the weather data for the building location in Sharjah, UAE. The cooling load inside the building and its cost were evaluated for both cases. The use of BIPV facade system case in hot, dry and humid region saved the annual electrical consumption for the air conditioning system by 27.69% while it reduced the yearly energy cost by US$ 2084. Such a study would offer data at critical climate conditions necessary for the design and future implementation of this system in the Emirate of Sharjah.",Air conditioning; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Civil engineering; Software; Facade; Energy consumption; Cooling load; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electric potential energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2020.02.062,journal article,University of Sharjah,ae
2,027-744-670-690-808,A Novel BIPV Reconfiguration Algorithm for Maximum Power Generation under Partial Shading,2020,"The feasibility of electricity production via solar energy in the Middle East is high due to the enormous value of solar radiation. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are systems used to utilise the unused spaces that can be installed on the facade or roof by replacing the building’s main element. However, the main problem associated with electricity production by BIPV is partial shading on the roof, which can produce multiple hot spots and disturbances to the system if the insolation values within the whole BIPV array vary. Partial shading, in this case, is observed due to the complexly shaped roof. This paper studies the partial shading effect on one of Qatar’s most recent projects (metro stations), and models the Education City station, which is a major station. The rooftop is complex, and it has many wavy shapes that can affect the BIPV system’s performance. The station is modelled using building-information modelling (BIM) software, wherein all of the station’s models are gathered and linked using BIM software to illustrate the BIPV and indicate the solar insolation distribution on the rooftop by simulating the station’s rooftop. The system is optimised for maximum yield to determine the optimal configuration and number of modules for each string using a genetic algorithm. The outcomes from the algorithm are based on clustering the solar insolation values and then applying a genetic algorithm optimisation to indicate the optimum BIPV array layout for maximum yield.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Maximum power principle; Automotive engineering; Roof; Computer science; Electricity generation; Solar energy; Photovoltaics; Building information modeling; Insolation,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13174470,journal article,Khalifa University,ae
3,029-815-005-033-910,Energy analysis of facade-integrated photovoltaic systems applied to UAE commercial buildings,2010,"Abstract Developments in the design and manufacture of photovoltaic cells have recently been a growing concern in the UAE. At present, the embodied energy pay-back time (EPBT) is the criterion used for comparing the viability of such technology against other forms. However, the impact of PV technology on the thermal performance of buildings is not considered at the time of EPBT estimation. If additional energy savings gained over the PV system life are also included, the total EPBT could be shorter. This paper explores the variation of the total energy of building integrated photovoltaic systems (BiPV) as a wall cladding system applied to the UAE commercial sector and shows that the ratio between PV output and saving in energy due to PV panels is within the range of 1:3–1:4. The result indicates that for the southern and western facades in the UAE, the embodied energy pay-back time for photovoltaic system is within the range of 12–13 years. When reductions in operational energy are considered, the pay-back time is reduced to 3.0–3.2 years. This study comes to the conclusion that the reduction in operational energy due to PV panels represents an important factor in the estimation of EPBT.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Payback period; Automotive engineering; Embodied energy; Solar architecture; Facade; Solar cell; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2010.10.002,journal article,United Arab Emirates University,ae
4,043-746-969-501-003,On the value of decentralised PV systems for the GCC residential sector,2011,"Based on the rich natural potential of the Gulf region, solar energy is expected to play a greater role in the future of the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries. This study examines whether the integration of the photovoltaic (PV) into individual residential buildings in the GCC countries is worth the investment. A prototype residential building is developed and a building integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) system is then designed. The system performance is simulated, and through economic analysis, it is shown that the current BiPV technology is not a cost-effective option for the GCC countries based on the present electricity tariff, PV system cost and system efficiency. The only way such a system would be viable with current technology is if the electricity tariff were to increase substantially. However, if the tariff remains constant for the foreseeable future, BiPV solar energy technology will only be feasible if the total system cost drops drastically. This study shows that BiPV systems offer cost reductions in both energy and economic terms over centralised PV plants, especially if the costs of avoided building construction materials are taken into account. To bring about the benefits of BiPV technology for the GCC residential sector, therefore, the first logical and most practical step is the implementation of a continuous promotion strategy that consists of both subsidies for investments and reasonable tariffs.",Environmental resource management; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Environmental economics; Electricity; Tariff; Investment (macroeconomics); Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Promotion (rank); Subsidy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.038,journal article,United Arab Emirates University,ae

Building integrated photovoltaic materials are well developed and has the potential to advance the photovoltaic systems installations on residential and commercial buildings. One of the main limitations on residential system is the utility allowable AC power generation. The installation of BIPV on houses offer numerous orientation and tilts of the PV system which ensure sun energy is harvested for wider timeframe. The different orientations and tilts reflect changes in the generate output power. The available residential inverters have one of two MPPTs which limit the orientation and tilts of the system to a maximum of two options per inverter.  Adding more inverters will add cost burden on the system, exceed the utility maximum allowable AC power generation, and additional inverters will not work at rated power throughout the day. The works in this paper include the detail design of a maximum power point box (MPPB) that harvest the sun energy for different orientations and tilts, manage and regulate the DC Bus Bar voltage level as well as generated DC power prior the inverter input terminal. The process is governed by an input from the inverter using an industrial communication protocol such as MODBUS.

9,063-695-971-536-529,The potential of phase change materials in mitigating cooling load of buildings in UAE,2019,"Integration of phase change materials (PCM) into building elements is explored extensively in the last decade to reduce air-conditioning demand for indoor thermal comfort. The PCM could absorb and release thermal energy as latent heat in a narrow temperature range. Several experimental studies reported energy saving and indoor temperature drop in summer conditions. However, the matter is sparsely researched in the environment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a region of high heat flux throughout the year.

10,072-529-738-286-36X,Review of Core/Shell Quantum Dots Technology Integrated into Building’s Glazing,2019,"Skylights and windows are building openings that enhance human comfort and well-being in various ways. Recently, a massive drive is witnessed to replace traditional openings with building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems to generate power in a bid to reduce buildings’ energy. The problem with most of the BIPV glazing lies in the obstruction of occupants’ vision of the outdoor view. In order to resolve this problem, new technology has emerged that utilizes quantum dots semiconductors (QDs) in glazing systems. QDs can absorb and re-emit the incoming radiation in the desired direction with the tunable spectrum, which renders them favorable for building integration. By redirecting the radiation towards edges of the glazing, they can be categorized as luminescent solar concentrators (QD-LSCs) that can help to generate electricity while maintaining transparency in the glazing. The aim of this paper is to review the different properties of core/shell quantum dots and their potential applications in buildings. Literature from various disciplines was reviewed to establish correlations between the optical and electrical properties of different types, sizes, thicknesses, and concentration ratios of QDs when used in transparent glazing. The current article will help building designers and system integrators assess the merits of integrating QDs on windows/skylights with regards to energy production and potential impact on admitted daylighting and visual comfort.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Quantum dot; Daylighting; Luminescence; Electricity; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Glazing; Engineering physics; Transparency (human–computer interaction),http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12061058,journal article,United Arab Emirates University,ae

Many new building proj ects being established in the region with roof spaces that can be utilized to install Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) system. However, due to the contemporary, sophisticated geometric design of the roofs in most of the building projects, the curvature of the rooftop creates a big insolation difference due to the partial shading of these rooftops. This paper illustrates the partial shading on the BIPV modules in one of Qatar's most recent project (Qatar Rail stations) by collecting data from the regional weather station and simulated data by using Building Information Modeling (BIM) for insolation simulation. The modeling of the BIPV system was done in MATLAB/Simulink. Different system configuration layout scenarios for different BIPV insolation were examined to show the behavior of which I-V and P-V characteristics with the highest insolation BIPV array. it is concluded that the system is preferred to be separated in parallel connection to not limit its current components with the smallest insolation value among all BIPV arrays.

13,008-108-696-049-510,Tuning the colors of c-Si solar cells by exploiting plasmonic effects,2016,"The color of a crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell is mainly determined by its anti-reflective coating. This is a lambda/4 coating made from a transparent dielectric material. The thickness of the anti-reflective coating is optimized for maximal photocurrent generation, resulting in the typical blue or black colors of c-Si solar cells. However, for building-integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) applications the color of the solar cells is demanded to be tunable – ideally by a cheap and flexible coating process on standard (low cost) c-Si solar cells. Such a coating can be realized by applying plasmonic coloring which is a rapidly growing technology for high-quality color filtering and rendering for different fields of application (displays, imaging,…). In this contribution, we present results of an approach for tuning the color of standard industrial c-Si solar cells that is based on coating them with metallic nano-particles. In particular, thin films (< 20 nm) of a metal (e.g., silver) were sputtered onto c-Si solar cells and thermally annealed subsequently. The sizes and the shapes of the nano-particles (characterized by SEM) were found to depend on the thickness of the deposited films and the surface roughness of the substrates/solar cells. With such an approach it is possible to tune the color of the standard c-Si cells from blue to green and brownish/red. The position of the resonance peak in the reflection spectrum was found to be almost independent from the angle of incidence. This low angular sensitivity is a clear advantage compared to alternative color tuning methods, for which additional dielectric thin films are deposited on c-Si solar cells.",Optics; Thin film; Materials science; Crystalline silicon; Solar cell; Coating; Photovoltaic system; Plasmonic solar cell; Quantum dot solar cell; Polymer solar cell,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2237754,conference article,Joanneum Research,at

In principle, PV can be integrated directly in products, such as devices, vehicles, and buildings. Nowadays, the development of photovoltaic modules is still primarily driven by the idea of economies of scales, which leads to unvaried PV modules that are only good for large-area installations. These photovoltaic modules are not suitable for the integration into building skins, roof tiles, or electric devices because of their rigidness and their electrical constraints. Even companies which could provide a solution for these applications (flexible thin-film PV firms) are not providing customized PV modules because of the associated set-up times.

In this study the use of a single baffle was examined as a possible low cost means of suppressing heat loss by natural convection in an attic shaped enclosure.

By matching the absorber colour with that of the roof or facade of the building, it is possible to achieve an architecturally and visually pleasing result.

In this study, the thermal performance of a series of coloured (ranging from white to black), building integrated solar collectors for water heating was examined both theoretically and experimentally. Subsequently, the annual solar fraction for typical water heating systems with coloured absorbers was calculated. The results showed that coloured solar collector absorbers can make noticeable contributions to heating loads.

Thermal boundary layers on vertical flat surfaces of a photovoltaic (PV) and a metallic plate were traversed. The plate consisted of twelve heaters where heat flux and surface temperature were controlled and measured. Uniform heat flux condition was developed on the heaters to closely simulate non-uniform temperature distribution on vertical PV modules. The two thermocouples on the probe measured local air temperature and contact temperature with the wall surface. Experimental results were presented in the forms of local Nusselt numbers versus Rayleigh numbers “Nu=a * (Ra)b”, and surface temperature versus dimensionless height [Ts -T∞= c*(z/h)d]. The constant values for “a”, “b”, “c” and “d” were determined from the best curve-fitting to the power-law relation. The convection heat transfer predictions from the empirical correlations were found to be in consistent with those predictions made by a number of correlations published in the open literature. A simple technique is then proposed to employ two experimental data from the probe to refine empirical correlations as the operational conditions change. A flexible technique to update correlations is of prime significance requirement in thermal design and operation of BIPV modules. The work is in progress to further extend the correlation to predict the combined radiation and convection on inclined PVs and channels.Copyright © 2015 by ASME",Convection; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Nusselt number; Work (thermodynamics); Heat flux; Thermocouple; Thermal; Convective heat transfer; Mechanics; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/es2015-49764,conference article,"University of Technology, Sydney",au

Critical across all these applications is achieving both high efficiency and stable photovoltaic performance of such devices. Realizing both of these properties simultaneously has not been possible using device architectures featuring the archetypal doped Spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transport layer (HTL). As such, in this work we explore the use of a solution-processed cross-linked HTL formed from N4,N4′-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N4,N4′-bis(4-vinylphenyl)biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (VNPB) molecules as an alternative to the conventional Spiro-OMeTAD within an FTO/SnO2/C60-SAM/Perovskite/HTL/MoOx/ultra-thin gold/MoOx ST-PeSC device architecture. Through an optimized multi-step thermal treatment process that maximizes charge extraction and reduces recombination from these devices, we can achieve ST-PeSCs that exhibit record power conversion efficiencies for Spiro-OMeTAD-free devices with average visible transmittance values between 10 and 30%. These devices exhibit comparable efficiencies to their Spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, with the additional benefit that the use of the poly-VNPB as the HTL material provides significant improvements in long-term device stability under both continuous illumination and high humidity conditions.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Transmittance; Perovskite (structure); Materials science; Tandem; Hole transport layer; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Doping; Thermal treatment,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104635,journal article,"Monash University, Clayton campus",au

BIPV products are commercially available, but their electrical power outputs in practice are negatively affected by several factors in outdoor environments. Performance improvement of BIPV applications requires mitigation approaches based on an understanding of these factors. A review was, therefore, conducted on this issue in order to providing guidance for practical applications in terms of the selection of proper PV technologies, temperature management, solar irradiation enhancement and avoidance of excessive mechanical strain. First, major types of PV cells used in BIPV applications were comparatively studied in terms of their electrical performances in laboratorial and outdoor environments. Second, temperature elevations were widely reported in outdoor BIPV applications, which may cause efficiency degradation, and the mitigation approaches may include air-flow ventilation, water circulation and utilization of phase change materials. The heat collected from the PV cells may also be further utilized. Third, mechanical strains may be transferred to the integrated PV cells in BIPV applications, and their effects on electrical performance PV cells were also discussed.

Government policy plays a significant role in nurturing and protecting energy innovations at the early development stage, such as BIPV. However, various actors could have divergent views on the policies for energy innovations, and policymakers need to consider these views in policymaking to avoid potential failures in policy implementation. By taking BIPV as an example, this study aims to reveal stakeholders' different perspectives on the required innovation policies for new energy technologies based on Q methodology. The results indicate even though stakeholders share similar views on some aspects of BIPV policies, four significantly distinct policy perspectives on BIPV exist in stakeholders' mindsets, including supervisory support, intensively investigate, cautiously stimulate and proactively promote. These policy perspectives require significantly different approaches to promote BIPV, which indicates the complexity in formulating one set of policy mix catering for the various mindsets of stakeholders. This study has both theoretical contributions to innovation policy mix for energy transitions, and policy implications for promoting energy innovations, especially BIPV worldwide.",Public policy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Energy policy; Environmental economics; Business; Renewable energy; Solar power; Energy transition; Policy mix; Energy (esotericism),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.047,journal article,Bond University,au

Semitransparent perovskite solar cells are also useful as the upper sub-cell in tandem applications. In this study, we demonstrate efficient perovskite solar cells with good transparency in the visible spectrum (400–800 nm). The device efficiency and transparency were controlled by varying the perovskite layer thickness, including devices with a perovskite thickness as low as 40 nm. A dielectric/metal/dielectric (D/M/D) electrode was used as the transparent back electrode. The best performing device exhibited >9% efficiency at 12.4% average visible transparency. By reducing the perovskite layer thickness, the transparency further increased to 20.5% at an efficiency of 3.5%. Furthermore, perovskite layer thickness-dependent hysteresis behaviour, colour perception in human eye and month-long systematic degradation patterns are investigated and discussed comprehensively.

Energy efficient residential house envelopes can reduce our dependency on fossil fuel and environmental pollution. It is difficult to achieve high energy savings for ongoing heating and cooling with currently used mainstream residential house envelopes. A new energy smart house wall system is required to achieve energy conservation. Therefore the main objective of this study is to investigate the thermal performance of a new house wall envelope and compare its performance with a conventional house envelope. The study was undertaken for several climate zones encompassing all major cities in Australia.

This paper presents the results of numerical simulation for the performance prediction of building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal double-skin facade (BIPV/T-DSF). Different BIPV materials (amorphous silicon PV, dye-sensitized solar cell and Perovskite based solar cells) were considered as the exterior cladding of a North-facing facade of an office building located in Australia. The performance assessment involved the selection of three climates in Australia, represented by the cities of Darwin, Sydney and Canberra. The air cavity created between the outer skin and the inner one were alternatively assessed in the non-ventilated, naturally-ventilated and mechanically-ventilated modes of operation, while a full sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the influence of different design parameters, such as internal skin’s thermal transmittance, cavity depth, ventilation louvres’ opening ratio and cavity ventilation rate. By comparing the different operational modes and BIPV technologies, it was found that naturally-ventilated DSF integrating the Perovskite-based solar cell could be the optimal configuration achieving the highest savings. Total annual energy savings of 34.1%, 86% and 106% annual were reached respectively in Darwin, Sydney and Canberra, in comparison to conventional technologies. In addition, this facade technology could further reduce the building’s heating and cooling loads by harvesting thermal energy generated within the air cavity. The study finally demonstrated that the harvested electrical and thermal energy from the facade could cover a significant share of building’s energy consumption.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal transmittance; Building envelope; Marine engineering; Double-skin facade; Facade; Energy consumption; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2020.02.044,journal article,University of New South Wales,au

In building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), the overall energy management of an installation must include not only the electrical output from the photovoltaic component but also the net light and heat flows as well as the temperature distributions. As the light reflectance and emittance of solar cells are strongly angle-dependent, total thermal hemispherical emittance should be used instead of normal spectral emittance for accurate calculation of radiative heat transfers and hence solar cell operating temperature. Here we report the analysis of solar cell and internal glass temperature as a function of the measured total hemispherical emittance for the first time. We present a comprehensive model using total hemispherical emittance for determining solar cell and internal glass surface temperatures for insulating and laminated glazing units incorporating an operating photovoltaic cell. In warm weather (30 °C outdoors), solar cell and internal glass temperatures are 45–55 °C in laminated glass while in an insulated glazing the solar cell temperature is 60–75 °C and the internal glass temperature is maintained close to ambient temperature (20 °C indoors). We show that the solar cell front and rear emittance, location, and encapsulation method as well as the type of glazing system impact on the solar cell performance and internal glass temperatures. This study provides recommendations for designing BIPV glazing systems that minimize power loss from the solar cells while optimizing transmitted heat and shows the importance of engineering the correct front and rear solar cell emittances.",Operating temperature; Materials science; Perovskite solar cell; Solar cell; Insulated glazing; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Glazing; Photovoltaics; Thermal emittance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115490,journal article,University of Sydney,au

Experts across the globe have been working in the development of new technologies, which not only reduce the building energy consumption but also harness energy from renewable sources. Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system is one of the most popular techniques towards constructing a net-zero energy building through the utilisation of solar energy. In this review, we focus on the BIPV applications in Australia, where BIPV has not been prevailed as widely as might be expected despite the high solar irradiation in the country. This paper discusses recent advancements in BIPV systems and challenges that Australia is facing in order to adopt this technology. In addition, the current carbon emission issues in Australia are presented to build awareness among people, which will contribute towards adopting this technology.

BIPV products development has been ongoing for the past 30 years, but their practical applications have been slow in comparison to conventional rack-mounted solar PV. One of the main reasons is that the technical barriers, which span from design phase through to commissioning and maintenance phases, have not been understood by stakeholders. The aim of this research is to identify the technical barriers and risks associated with the application of BIPV from building design through to operation stages, together with proposing possible solutions. Where a solution could not be proposed, recommendations for future research and development are made. A four-step research approach is employed, which includes examination of previous publications and collection of feedback from the industry professionals.

Buoyancy-driven flow in heated open-ended channels was modelled with the channel inclination angle ranging from 15° to 90° and the channel height-to-width ratio being 20. In each case, a uniform heat flux was applied along the top wall and the bottom wall was assumed to be adiabatic. Effect of varying inclination angle on the velocity and temperature fields is explored through the mean and turbulence quantities. A comparison between experimental and modelling results shows that open-ended channels with low inclination angles are characterised by low chimney effect and induced flow rate, thereby decreasing the heat transfer along the photovoltaic panels. In addition, propagation of disturbances and vortical structures in the channel which are necessary to enhance heat transfer are less eminent in these cases. Furthermore, heat transfer characteristics of turbulent natural convection in tilted channels are recast in terms of relevant dimensionless parameters so that they may be readily applied in cases with the aspect ratio and heat fluxes which are considered in this study.",Adiabatic process; Optics; Engineering; Heat flux; Turbulence; Dimensionless quantity; Heat transfer; Natural convection; Stack effect; Mechanics; Flow (psychology),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.10.014,journal article,University of New South Wales,au

By incorporating spectrally-selective diffraction gratings as light deflecting structures of high visible transparency into lamination interlayers and using improved spectrally-selective thin-film coatings, most of the visible solar radiation can be transmitted through the glass windows with minimum attenuation. At the same time, the ultraviolet (UV) and a part of incident solar infrared (IR) radiation energy are converted and/or deflected geometrically towards the panel edge for collection by CuInSe2 solar cells.

In this paper thin-film flexible amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV cells and organic PV cells are adhesively bonded to glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) sections to develop BIPV integrations. Such integrations and GFRP sections are then exposed to artificial sunlight with various intensities from 200 to 1000 W/m2. An approximate linear increase in the surface temperature with the sunlight intensity is observed and quantified, and such thermal responses are also explained by thermomechanical analysis. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the integrated a-Si PV cell decreases almost linearly at 0.40% for an increase of 1 °C until the maximum temperature (91.5 °C) in the experiments; while VOC of the integrated organic PV cells decreases at 0.12% for an increase of 1 °C first until a significant degradation occurred at 78 °C. Such GFRP sections with PV cells are further examined under tensile or compressive loadings. The tensile results show that both types of PV cells can normally function up to GFRP breakage at about 1% strain. However, in compression, obvious decreases in VOC are witnessed when a compressive strain of 0.23% on average is reached for the integrated a-Si PV cells. Such a critical compressive strain for the integrated organic PV cells is 0.25% on average.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Ultimate tensile strength; Thermomechanical analysis; Composite material; Glass fiber; Thin film; Materials science; Artificial sunlight; Photovoltaics; Fibre-reinforced plastic,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.125809,journal article,"Monash University, Clayton campus",au

Numerous locations, isolated from the electricity grid have benefited from photovoltaic energy supply with economic justification and provided a platform from which the scientific knowledge and expertise has grown over 30 years. Of current global relevance is the transition and growth of photovoltaic applications in the urban environment through building-integrated PV (BiPV) and its use as a clever building material. Energy market dynamics in Australia and low-priced fossil fuels limit the present market potential for BiPV. Showcase projects and government programmes have provided the much needed impetus to develop and introduce BiPV products to the building industry and, importantly, experiment with architectural design solutions that strive to offer added benefits to the built environment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for reducing the cooling systems’ environmental footprint with applications of alternative renewable energy source. Three types of cooling systems, water cooled, air cooled and a hybrid solar-based air-conditioning system, with a total of six scenarios were designed in this work. The scenarios accounted for the types of power supply to the air-conditioning systems with electricity from the grid and with a solar power from highly integrated building photovoltaics (BIPV). Within and between these scenarios, systems’ energy performances were compared based on energy modelling while the harvesting potential of the renewable energy source was further predicted based on building’s detailed geometrical model. The results showed that renewable energy obtained via BIPV scenario could cover building’s annual electricity consumption for cooling and reduce 140 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year.

Lack of confidence in the economic viability of BIPV has become one of the critical issues in investment decisions. Therefore, there is a need to review the real economic value of recent BIPV projects to dispel the common myth of the high cost of BIPV. This paper reviews forty-five (45) BIPV projects attached to non-domestic buildings located in twelve (12) western countries between 2009 and 2018 to understand their real economic value. Levelized cost energy, net present value and discounted payback periods are estimated to identify both direct and indirect benefits of BIPV. The economic assessment revealed that projects are economically feasible when both direct and indirect are measured. Analysis further discovered that 1) curtain wall, double-skin facades, discontinuous roofs and skylights among the building application types, 2) educational buildings among the functions of non-domestic buildings and 3) c-Si among the module technologies are economically feasible performances. BIPVs are complex and unique designs with diverse economic performances. It is important to carefully select the parameters to assess the performance levels of the application before any decision is made. The study confirms that understanding the broad values facilitates the quantification of the real contribution of BIPV.

Building integrated PV (BIPV) projects are emerging as the strongest part of the PV market and grid interactive inverters are a key component in determining the total system cost. Module integrated converter (MIC) technology has become a global trend in grid interactive PV applications and may assist in driving down the balance of system costs to secure an improved total system cost. This paper concentrates on the topology study of the PV MICs in the power range below 500 W and covers most topologies recently proposed for MIC applications. The MIC topologies are classified into three different arrangements based on the dc link configurations. A systematic discussion is also provided at the end of the paper that focuses on the major advantages and disadvantages of each MIC arrangement. These are considered in detail and will provide a useful framework and point of reference for the next generation MIC designs and applications.,Phase shift module; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Topology (electrical circuits); Grid; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Electronic engineering; AC module; Balance of system; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tpel.2008.920883,journal article,Central Queensland University,au

Eddie Leonardi had a large range of research interests: he worked in both computational fluid dynamics/heat transfer and refrigeration and air-conditioning for over 25 years. However starting from his PhD ‘A numerical Study of the effects of fluid properties on Natural Convection’ awarded in 1984, one of his main passions has been natural convection and therefore the focus of this lecture will be on what Eddie Leonardi has achieved in numerical and experimental investigations of laminar natural convective flows. A number of examples will be presented which illustrate important difficulties of numerical calculations and experimental comparisons. Eddie Leonardi demonstrated that variable properties have important effects and significant differences occur when different fluids are used, so that non-dimensionalisation is not an appropriate tool when dealing with fluids in thermally driven flows in which there are significant changes in transport properties. Difficulties in comparing numerical solutions with either numerically generated data or experimental results will be discussed with reference to two-dimensional natural convection and three-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection in bounded domains with conducting boundaries. For a number of years Eddie Leonardi was involved in a joint US-French-Australian research program — the MEPHISTO experiment on crystal growth — and studied the effects of convection on solidification and melting under microgravity conditions.

According to the position of the BIPVT and EAHE systems, two different configurations (i.e. configuration A and configuration B) are examined. In the heating mode of the configuration A, the cold outdoor air is twice preheated by passing through the EAHE and BIPVT systems. In the cooling mode of the configuration A, the hot outdoor air is precooled by flowing inside the EAHE system and the photovoltaic (PV) modules are cooled using the building exhaust air. The cooling mode of the configuration B is similar to the configuration A, while in the heating mode of the configuration B, the outdoor air first enters the BIPVT collector and then passes through the EAHE system. The annual total amount of produced energy and exergy are considered as the objective functions. The effective parameters in the optimization process include the air mass flow rate, the length, width and depth of BIPVT channel and the length and depth of EAHE system. The outcomes revealed that the annual total energy and exergy outputs of the optimum configuration A are 96448.6 kWh and 10015.5 kWh, respectively, while these values for the optimum configuration B are respectively 98537.5 and 9888.4 kWh.",Heat exchanger; Exergy; Nuclear engineering; Volumetric flow rate; Energy (signal processing); Materials science; Thermal; Air mass (solar energy); Total energy; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.074,journal article,University of Wollongong,au

The benefits of building integration are well documented and are gaining significant public recognition and government support. PV cells, however, convert only a small portion of the incoming insolation into electricity. The rest is either reflected or lost in the form of sensible heat and light. Various research projects have been conducted on the forms these by-products can take as cogeneration. The term cogeneration is usually associated with utility-scale fossil-fuel electrical generation using combined heat and power production. It is used here in the same spirit in the evaluation of waste heat and by-products in the production of PV electricity. It is important to have a proper synthesis between BiPV cogeneration products, building design, and other HVAC systems in order to avoid overheating or redundancy. Thus, this paper looks at the state-of-the-art in PV cogen from a whole building perspective. Both built examples and research will be reviewed. By taking a holistic approach to the research and products already available, the tools for a more effective building integrated system can be devised. This should increase net system efficiency and lower installed cost per unit area. An evaluation method is also presented that examines the energy and economic performances of PV/T systems.

57,135-708-631-834-116,Numerical simulation study of BIPV/T double-skin facade for various climate zones in Australia: effects on indoor thermal comfort,2018,"Maintaining indoor thermal comfort is crucial for the health and productivity of building occupants. Building envelope plays a major role in influencing the impact of outdoor climate and controlling the indoor thermal conditions. In this paper, comparative analysis of indoor comfortable temperature for four different types of building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) building models in a range of climate zones in Australia was conducted using TRNSYS simulation tool. In terms of system operational mode, the four types of BIPV/T building facade systems include a building-integrated photovoltaic single-skin facade (SSF), non-ventilated BIPV/T double-skin facade (BIPV/T-DSF), naturally ventilated BIPV/T-DSF and fan-assisted BIPV/T-DSF. In addition to the operational modes of the facade systems, two types of semi-transparent PV glazing with different visible light transmittance (VLT) were respectively applied to the models as external window glazing. The numerical results showed that the naturally ventilated BIPV/T-DSF with lower VLT (27%) PV glazing maintained a relatively better indoor temperature for the hot climatic conditions compared to the other operational modes, while the non-ventilated BIPV/T-DSF with higher VLT PV glazing (37.5%) offered more comfortable indoor temperature (i.e. 20 to 26 °C for office hours) for the cold climates in Australia. On the other hand, the naturally ventilated BIPV/T-DSF could basically maintain comfortable indoor temperatures from 22 to 27 °C during office hours without mechanical systems for the peak summer times for cool temperate climates in Australia. Moreover, it was found that the thermal insulation effect of semi-transparent PV glazing hardly affected indoor operative temperature in the ventilated modes of the BIPV/T-DSF. According to the sensitivity analysis, the change of U-value of internal window of the DSF would significantly lead to the change of indoor thermal comfort in both ventilated operational modes, but very few changes for the non-ventilated DSF. The variation of cavity depth had distinct impact on the indoor thermal comfort for fan-assisted DSF but slightly affected that of other modes. In addition, the changes of opening ratio for the ventilating louvers and fan airflow rate of the DSF also had a degree of influence on indoor thermal comfort for naturally ventilated DSF and fan-assisted DSF respectively.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal comfort; Meteorology; Building envelope; Double-skin facade; TRNSYS; Facade; Environmental science; Glazing; Operative temperature,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12273-018-0489-x,journal article,University of New South Wales,au
58,139-293-447-979-829,Modeling Boron–Oxygen Degradation and Self-Repairing Silicon PV Modules in the Field,2020,"Photovoltaic (PV) cells manufactured using p-type Czochralski wafers can degrade significantly in the field due to boron–oxygen (BO) defects. Commercial hydrogenation processes can now passivate such defects; however, this passivation can be destabilized under certain conditions. Module operating temperatures are rarely considered in defect studies, and yet are critical to understanding the degradation and passivation destabilization that may occur in the field. Here we show that the module operating temperatures are highly dependent on location and mounting, and the impact this has on BO defects in the field. The System Advisor Model is fed with typical meteorological year data from four locations around the world (Hamburg, Sydney, Tucson, and Wuhan) to predict module operating temperatures. We investigate three PV system mounting types: building integrated (BIPV), rack-mounted rooftop, and rack mounted on flat ground for a centralized system. BO defect reactions are then simulated, using a three-state model based on experimental values published in the literature and the predicted module operating temperatures. The simulation shows that the BIPV module in Tucson reaches 94 °C and stays above 50 °C for over 1600 h per year. These conditions could destabilize over one-third of passivated BO defects, resulting in a 0.4% absolute efficiency loss for the modules in this work. This absolute efficiency loss could be double for higher efficiency solar cell structures, and modules. On the other hand, passivation of BO defects can occur in the field if hydrogen is present and the module is under the right environmental conditions. It is therefore important to consider the specific installation location and type (or predicted operating temperatures) to determine the best way to treat BO defects. Modules that experience such extreme sustained conditions should be manufactured to ensure incorporation of hydrogen to enable passivation of BO defects in the field, thereby enabling a “self-repairing module.”",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Typical meteorological year; Wafer; Materials science; Chemical substance; Solar cell; Passivation; Photovoltaic system; Silicon; Engineering physics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jphotov.2019.2945161,journal article,University of New South Wales,au

However, the optimisation of arrays of DSC is not straightforward because of the lower power levels obtained and the corresponding increased stringency needed when calculating the production tolerances permissible in the individual cells. This paper describes the first stage of project to devise and build a DSC array simulator driven solely by a phenomenological model of individual DSC behaviour at the level of infinitesimal cells. The simulator numerically extrapolates this behaviour to real finite cells and thence to a real physical array. In the process it is observed that optimisation of infinitesimal cells is only possible when the size of the real cell is first decided, and that the relationship between the conducting oxide transparency and electrical resistance is critical for the optimisation to be effective. The results obtained using the simulator are compared with the behaviour of real test cell assemblies manufactured by STI, a DSC Licensee, and are found to be in good agreement. Their effects on the costs of delivered power are discussed.",Optics; Materials science; Electricity; Phenomenological model; Numerical analysis; Mechanical engineering; Direct insolation; Electrical resistance and conductance,https://core.ac.uk/display/10874794,journal article,Queensland University of Technology,au

The PV systems cover 405 m 2 (60 tilted surface and two vertical towers on east and west sides of the building) with single and triple junction amorphous (3j-aSi) photovoltaic modules. The total installed power of the BIPV system is 40.3 kWp. Total cumulative produced electricity of the BIPV system at the end of 2014 from the start up is exceeding 200,000 kW h. In this work, the shading effect on the performance of two PV systems based on 3j-aSi photovoltaic modules on the facade is analysed. There are 5 rows on the facade of the building and two identical strings’ energy rating values are compared. One string has only row shading but the second string has smaller shading. In this comparison it is found that energetic performances so called energy rating (kW h/kWp) values of the arrays differ 16% for an annual average between 10% and 24% monthly intervals. In winter months the shading effect is caused by the tree is less than 1% in the electricity yield where there is no row shading in winter months. But in summer months (because of the height of the sun) the calculated energy yield difference is about 15%. In 21st of June between 9.00 and 13.00 it is calculated that the output between the inverters is 15% where there is no shading because of the tree all shading is from the upper rows. PV data is collected with a Sunlog data logger. Daily power and electricity production values and the shading effect on different seasons are also analysed.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Row; Meteorology; Data logger; Shading; Electricity; Facade; Mathematics; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2015.08.022,journal article,Muğla University,bd

It used parametric numerical modelling to critically appraise the potential of eight design configurations in this regard, including vertical and horizontal shading devices with different inclination angles. The study assumed that the examined shading devices could be entirely horizontal or vertical on the three exposed facades, which is common practice in architecture. The study found that the examined configurations offered different solar and shading potentials. However, the case of horizontal BIPV shading devices with a 45° tilt angle received the highest amount of annual total insolation (104 kWh/m2) and offered effective window shading of 96% of the total window area on average in summer. The study concluded that, unlike the common recommendation of avoiding horizontal shading devices on eastern and western facades, it is possible in countries characterised with high solar altitudes such as Saudi Arabia to use them effectively to generate electricity and provide the required window shading.</jats:p>",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Shading; Environmental science; Engineering physics,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124373,journal article,Islamic University,bd

One of the targets for this technology is to place the module-level power converter into the photovoltaic module's frame to achieve an integrated system. Temperature is the most influential parameter for a converter's reliability, its damage caused on the components needs to be studied in detail. In this paper, a reliability comparison based on a four-day mission profile has been made in order to assess the most reliable frame position for this converter to be placed in as all of them possess a different temperature profile. The results show that placing the converter in the lateral bottom of the frame is significantly more reliable than the mid or top position. In addition, a lifetime analysis is performed on the converter's dc-link capacitor in order to demonstrate the required methodology. In future work, this can be extended towards other sensitive components when appropriate lifetime models become available.

71,007-401-603-783-115,First smart 8.64 kW BIPV in a building in Awali Town at Kingdom of Bahrain,2018,"Abstract The performance of 18 months of 86.4 kW smart PV solar panels integrated in a building in Sadeem Building at Awali Town (middle of a desert area) in the kingdom of Bahrain is reported herein. The PV system covers an area of 59 m2 (36 PV panels) and was installed on a roof titled by 25° and facing 225° (45° west of south). The panels are cleaned by sweet water every 2 months and it requires around 500 l of the water for the total panels installed on the roof each cycle (i.e. 14 l/Panel). The records show that the annual generated solar electricity from this system (8.64 kW) in 2015 was 8879 kW h and the expected energy set by producer (Petra solar) was 11,990 kWh while it was expected to be 13,485.7 kWh (according to NREL PVWatt Calculator) and 14,137.0 kWh. These results indicate that the installation produced solar electricity less than the expected by 26.0%, 34.2% and 37.2%, respectively. Surprisingly, the total solar electricity actually gained in 6 months (January to June) in 2015 was 4471 kWh, while the total solar electricity actually gained in 6 months (January to June) in 2016 was 5519 kWh. The payback for this BIPV Sadeem Building will be 624 years, while if feed–in– tariff is set to purchase each 1 kWh solar electricity for 380 fils (about USD1) then the payback will be reasonable (about 5 years). This reaches to the conclusion that either the government sells the PV system with a highly subsidized rate or purchases each kWh of solar electricity at not less than USD1. Assuming that each kWh results in emitting about 1 kg of CO2, then this BIPV saves, annually, the emission of about 9 t of CO2.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Operations management; Tariff; Roof; Solar electricity; Photovoltaic system; Agricultural economics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.041,journal article,University of Bahrain,bh

The project should be development focused on sustainability, explore the passive strategies and the energy generation potential of facades and roof. In this paper we analyze for the first time in Brazil and under current solar photovoltaic (PV) module prices, the technical and economic potential of integrating state-of-the-art, frameless, glass-glass thin-film cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV modules on a commercial building facade and roof, and evaluate the economic feasibility of replacing traditional facade materials like architectural glass and aluminum composite material with sleek black PV modules in six Brazilian cities. The technical analysis consisted in evaluating the energy performance of a four-storey office building for each of the six cities under analysis. The technical analysis showed that it is possible to fully meet the energy demand of the office building with PV integration in all the Brazilian cities evaluated. While the local climate has a significant impact on the energy consumption due mostly to air conditioning loads, PV energy production follows the same trend. Most importantly, the economic analysis showed that with the declining costs of photovoltaics, replacing conventional facade building materials with PV modules is not only an innovative approach but also of economic benefit.",Air conditioning; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Civil engineering; Architectural engineering; Roof; Facade; Energy consumption; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.10.091,journal article,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,br
74,009-614-320-632-140,Limitations in solar module azimuth and tilt angles in building integrated photovoltaics at low latitude tropical sites in Brazil,2014,"Abstract Photovoltaic (PV) generation depends directly on the amount of radiation received by solar modules at a given temperature, and annual irradiation varies according to site location and PV array position. In this paper, the limitations and the solar irradiation levels received by building surfaces in different positions (with azimuth and tilt angle variation) in capital cities in Brazil are shown, making use of the Brazilian global horizontal solar irradiation data provided by the SWERA (Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment) project. These data were processed to generate figures on the irradiation at various PV module orientations and slopes for each city, which show the relative radiation levels received on specific azimuth and tilt angles in relation to the ideal position. Results were validated using four real and operating PV systems. In general, variations in azimuth or slope did not cause large annual irradiation losses up to around 20° tilt angles. This shows to PV system planners that under these fairly flexible conditions it is possible to install PV on any orientation, keeping high levels of annual irradiation, and that limitations in orientation and tilt can be relatively low. It also allows a quick analysis of PV retrofit in building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV), when seeking the best building surfaces to incorporate PV.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Position (vector); Orientation (geometry); Azimuth; Tilt (optics); Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics; Remote sensing; Wind power,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.09.008,journal article,Universidade Federal de Santa Maria,br

The objective of Part 2 is to apply the simplified method described in Part 1 in order to estimate the influence of partial shadings on the performance of four installed and in operation BIPV systems. The method consists in identifying and quantifying the shading on a surface, relating the fraction of shaded area with the percentage of incident irradiation reduction during the same period, in order to propose a shading index (SI) that represents the energy losses on partially shaded PV systems. SI was validated through the analysed case studies and it was proved to be a convenient way of estimating the PV generation of partially shaded PV systems.

78,035-969-654-928-836,Potential of building integrated photovoltaic solar energy generators in assisting daytime peaking feeders in urban areas in Brazil,2008,"Abstract Because of the intermittent nature of the solar radiation resource, photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generation is considered a non-dispatchable power source. However, under some conditions, in sunny urban areas with electricity load curves dominated by air conditioning loads, there is a high correlation between PV generation and utility feeder loads. In these situations, a considerable fraction of a given PV generator can be considered dispatchable power. In this work, we assess the potential of grid connected, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) generation in the state capital, Florianopolis, in south Brazil (27 °S, 48 °W), which is supplied by the local utility company through 56 feeders. Our interest was to identify which feeder could obtain more benefits with implementation of a PV plant with a specific nominal power. Two factors are important in this analysis: the peak demand reduction value, and the LOLP (loss of load probability, in failures per year), or LOLE (loss of load expectation, in hours per year). We analyzed the hourly demand curves of the 56 feeders and compared them with the PV power generation values obtained from a 2 kWp BIPV installation that has been operating continuously for nearly 10 years connected to one of these feeders. For our calculations, we defined a PV installation of 1000 kWpAC, which corresponds to penetration level values between 10% and 20%, depending on the specific feeder considered. Our results demonstrate that the use of PV power plants can reduce significantly the summer demand peaks in regions where the load reflects commercial customers demand for midday air conditioning.",Air conditioning; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Peak demand; Peaking power plant; Automotive engineering; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Telecommunications; Dispatchable generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2007.09.020,journal article,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,br

Residential buildings are responsible for 23% of the national electricity demand. Thus, it is necessary to search for new energy sources to both diversify and complement the energy mix. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is building momentum worldwide and can be an interesting alternative for Brazil due its solar radiation characteristics. This work analyses the potential of seven BIPV technologies implemented in a residential prototype simulated in three different cities in Brazil (Natal, Brasilia and Florianopolis). Simulations were performed using the software tool EnergyPlus to integrate PV power supply with building energy demand (domestic equipment and HVAC systems). The building model is a typical low-cost residential building for middle-class families, as massively constructed all over the country. Architectural input and heat gain schedules are defined from statistical data (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica—Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and Sistema de Informacoes de Posses de Eletrodomesticos e Habitos de Consumo—Consumer Habits and Appliance Ownership Information System (SIMPHA)). BIPV is considered in all opaque surfaces of the envelope. Results present an interesting potential for decentralized PV power supply even for vertical surfaces at low-latitude sites. In each facade, BIPV power supply can be directly linked to local climatic conditions. In general, for 30% of the year photovoltaic systems generate more energy than building demand, i.e., during this period it could be supplying the energy excess to the public electricity grid.

In order to assess the performance of BIPV systems from architectural perspectives, three not ideally positioned BIPV systems that use different technologies (c-Si, CdTe and CIGS), tilt angles, and azimuthal deviations were compared with two ideally oriented and tilted GM systems (CdTe), operating at the same warm and sunny site with simultaneous irradiance and energy data collected at high time resolution. All PV systems are installed in an urban environment, with complex aspects of architectural integration, orientation, partial shadings and performance. These aspects were analyzed in detail in this study. In addition, comparisons between real data measurements of all PV systems and PVSyst® software simulations were carried out. Results have shown that BIPV systems presented, in average, higher yields and performance ratios (PRs) than GM systems, and the real measurements validated the expected energy, even for PV systems with complex environment and tilt angle variations connected to the same inverter.

Maximum annual performance of grid-connected PV is usually obtained with modules tilted at an angle equal to the site latitude, facing the equator. The performance of PV systems not tilted and oriented ideally can drop considerably, depending on site latitude. With grid parity – when the cost of solar electricity becomes competitive with conventional electricity – expected in many countries in the present decade, a more widespread application of PV on buildings is expected, and in this context the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that good compromises between form and function are possible. In this work we compare the annual energy generation of a curved BIPV system installed as a car port rooftop, with an ideally-oriented and tilted, flat BIPV system installed as a building’s rooftop cover at a low-latitude site (27°S). For the one-year period analysed, the curved-shape BIPV system annual yield was 12% lower than that of the reference BIPV system, and during the summer months (November to February), the curved BIPV installation presented a higher energy yield than the latitude-tilted generator. With these results we show that a good compromise can be reached between form and function in BIPV systems.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electrical engineering; Latitude; Engineering; Meteorology; Grid parity; Grid; Electricity; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.04.024,journal article,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,br
85,090-038-294-745-946,"The role of grid-connected, building-integrated photovoltaic generation in commercial building energy and power loads in a warm and sunny climate",2010,"Abstract For large commercial buildings, power load delivery limits are contracted with the local electricity distribution utility, and are usually fixed at one or more levels over the year, according to the seasonal building loads, and depending on the specific country regulations. Especially in warm and sunny climates, solar electricity generation using building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) can assist in reducing commercial building loads, offering peak-shaving (power) benefits on top of the on-site generation of electricity (energy). This on-site power delivery capability gives these consumers the possibility of renegotiating demand contracts with their distribution utility. Commercial buildings that operate during daytime quite often have an energy consumption profile that is well matched by solar radiation availability, and depending on the building’s available surface areas, BIPV can generate considerable portions of the energy requirements. In this work we present the role of grid-connected BIPV in reducing the load demands of a large and urban commercial building located in a warm climate in Brazil. The building and adjacent car parking lots can accommodate a 1 MWp BIPV generator, which closely matches the building’s typical maximum power demands. Based on real solar radiation data and simultaneous building electricity demands for the year 2007, simulation of the annual solar generation profile of this on-site generator showed that the 1 MWp BIPV system could account for around 30% of the total building’s energy consumption. In addition to the energy benefit, maximum power demands were reduced due to a good match between midday air-conditioning cooling loads and solar radiation availability on both a daily and seasonal basis. Furthermore, we have simulated the effect of this considerably large urban-sited generator on the local distribution network load, and have shown that the 1 MWp BIPV installation can also offer considerable benefits to the local utility in shaving daytime peak loads at the corresponding feeder.",Stand-alone power system; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Civil engineering; Zero-energy building; Electricity; Electric power distribution; Energy consumption; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2010.04.013,journal article,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,br

The 2 kWp double-junction amorphous silicon PV system was retrofitted to the Solar Energy Laboratory's (LABSOLAR) building envelope, and connected through four commercial line-commutated inverters to the building's supply network. To demonstrate the architectural features of thin film PV technologies, both semitransparent and opaque modules were mounted on a north-facing, latitude-tilted overhang configuration. BIPV systems operating under the warmer conditions common in Brazil will typically experience relatively high operating temperatures, which suits the a-Si PV technology well. The installation is fully instrumented and is continuously monitored in order to allow the performance assessment of amorphous silicon PV operating at the prevailing conditions. This paper describes the design of the installation and presents system performance data from the first 18 months of operation.

Therefore, it is important to be aware of the consequences on systems performance metrics, namely annual specific yield and performance ratio for these specialised applications. This paper describes detailed analyses of shading effects, irradiation resource availability and module temperature on the performance metrics of individual subsystems of a rooftop BIPV installation in a high-rise building embedded in a high-density environment in Singapore.

89,134-750-006-896-808,Simplified method for shading-loss analysis in BIPV systems – part 1: Theoretical study,2017,"Abstract This paper proposes a simplified method to determine an index to quantify the influence of partial shadings on the performance of BIPV systems based on the relation between the shading percentages and the reduction of the incident irradiation on a given surface. The research is divided in two papers: Part 1: Theoretical study and Part 2: Application in case studies. Part 1 consists in identifying and quantifying the shading on a surface, and relates the fraction of shaded area with the percentage of incident irradiation reduction during the same period, in order to propose a shading index (SI) that represents the energy losses due to shadings on PV systems. The method was developed for a theoretical shaded case study simulated in two cities located at low latitude, tropical regions: Singapore (1.35°N) and Florianopolis-Brazil (27.48°S). Results showed that the shading percentage on the analysed surface on an annual basis is closer to the percentage of incident irradiation reduction at same period than when these values are compared on other time bases, as hourly, daily or monthly. Therefore, in this case, the annual percentage of shading can be adopted as the SI. SI was validated using different computer software packages and it was proved to be a convenient way of estimation the PV generation of similar cases of partially shaded PV systems, that could be used even before the PV electrical desing has been done.",Statistics; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Reduction (mathematics); Engineering; Shading; Energy (signal processing); Engineering drawing; Computer software; Pv generation; Low latitude; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.02.042,journal article,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,br
90,148-561-294-583-659,The strategic siting and the roofing area requirements of building-integrated photovoltaic solar energy generators in urban areas in Brazil,2008,"Abstract Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) generators are typically small and distributed solar power plants that occupy virtually no space because they are part of the building envelope, and they generate power at point of use. A more widespread use of grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) is hindered by a number of reasons which include the declining, but still high costs of the photogenerated kilowatt hour, and the lack of knowledge about the benefits of distributed generation with PV in the urban environment. When strategically sited, PV generators integrated to building facades and rooftops in urban areas at limited penetration levels can benefit local feeders with these distributed “negative loads”. A number of studies have been published, with learning curves demonstrating the cost-reduction potential of large-scale PV production, and in some markets the cost of PV electricity is approaching residential tariffs, the so-called grid parity. Due to the intermittent nature of the solar radiation resource, PV is considered non-despatchable power, but under some conditions, in sunny urban areas with electricity load curves dominated by air-conditioning loads, there is a high correlation between PV generation and feeder loads. In these situations, a considerable fraction of a given PV generator can be considered despatchable power. In this work we assess the potential of building-integrated, grid-connected PV generation in the state capital Florianopolis, in South Brazil. The deployment of six different commercially available PV technologies is compared with total roof area availability, solar generation profiles, and local feeder load curves for a selected number of urban areas in the city. Our results demonstrate the advantages of strategically siting PV generators in the urban environment.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Environmental economics; Grid parity; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Solar power; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Photovoltaics; Distributed generation; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.02.035,journal article,Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina,br

The BIPV/T system was integrated into the roof and the wall. Air was circulated behind the photovoltaic arrays to recover the thermal energy. The warm air recovered was supplied to the VC-ASHP. The thermal performance of the VC-ASHP was investigated for three scenarios when the heat pump is running in heating mode. The three scenarios are: (A) by feeding the ambient air to the ASHP; (B) by coupling the ASHP to the wall integrated BIPV/T only; and (C) by coupling the ASHP to the roof integrated BIPV/T only. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the VC-ASHP was evaluated for these three separate scenarios and compared. A typical winter day result suggests that the COP of the ASHP can be improved by coupling the VC-ASHP to either of the BIPV/T systems, i.e., either to the roof integrated BIPV/T system or to the wall integrated BIPV/T system.Copyright © 2014 by ASME",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Coefficient of performance; Air source heat pumps; Thermal; Heat pump; Roof; Photovoltaic system; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/es2014-6455,conference article,Ryerson University,ca

Air was circulated behind PV arrays and used as a coolant with various air flow rates (air velocities) to recover the thermal energy that could be used for space and/or domestic water heating. Turbulent flows were considered with Reynolds number ranging from 5199 to 9392. COMSOL Multiphysics finite element analysis (FEA) software was used to develop CFD models for the BIPV/T system using: (a) measured temperature profile at different flow rates, and (b) measured solar radiation as boundary condition. Predictions of the air temperature profiles inside the air flow channel and the backside of the PV were obtained and compared to experimentally obtained temperature profiles using both boundary conditions. In general, better agreement with the experimentally measured temperature profiles was obtained when the measured solar radiation was used as a boundary condition. The results of the study can be used to establish relationships between the average/local convective heat transfer coefficients and air flow velocity.

Changing facilities from net energy users to net energy producers is a major concern for supply chain managers who are interested in greening their business. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is an innovative design idea to achieve energy positive buildings. In a BIPV building, photovoltaic (PV) arrays are integrated into the structure of the building in order to transform the incident solar radiation to clean energy that can be used in facility operations. This option is dependent on the economic attractiveness of the solar PVs, which, in return, depends on the policies (incentives, subsidies, feed-in tariff) in effect at the facility location, the efficiency of the PVs installed, and the amount of incident solar radiation at the facility location. We present an economic model that calculates the cost per kWh capacity of solar PVs installed and then integrate the decision of installing PVs of different sizes on the facility rooftops of a supply chain subject to the different environmental policies available. We study the implications of our model based on a sensitivity analysis for different carbon credit prices, PV generation costs, and feed-in tariff prices.",Feed-in tariff; Facility location problem; Supply chain; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Business; Net present value; Renewable energy; Tariff; Photovoltaic system; Commerce,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.03.016,journal article,University of Waterloo,ca

In this model, a Building Integrated Photovoltaic-Thermal Collector (BIPV/T) was coupled with ASHP. The PV/T system arrangement was considered as a part of the south-oriented roof of the house. The warm air generated in the BIPV/T collector was considered the source of the heat pump for heat production. The coupling of BIPV/T and ASHP enables a highly efficient heating system in harsh winter conditions. The developed TRNSYS model of the house along with integrated PV/T system with ASHP was simulated for the whole year to predict the hourly outlet air temperature, thermal energy and electricity obtained from the PV/T array. The results from the simulation were used to estimate the saving in energy and cost as well as to predict the electricity related GHG emission reduction potential from the PV panels. Monthly greenhouse gas (GHG) emission credit from PV production based on hourly GHG emission factor was obtained; the results showed that annual GHG emission due to electricity demand by the ASHP was reduced by 225 kg CO2 (19.3%) when the heat pump was integrated with the PV/T array.

105,074-065-699-956-198,Distributed evolutionary algorithm for co-optimization of building and district systems for early community energy masterplanning,2018,"Abstract Buildings play a significant role in climate change mitigation. In North America, energy used to construct and operate buildings accounts for some 40% of total energy use, largely originating from fossil fuels. The strategic reduction of these energy demands requires knowledge of potential upgrades prior to a building's construction. Furthermore, renewable energy generation integrated into buildings facades and district systems can improve the resiliency of community infrastructure. However, loads that are non-coincidental with on-site generation can cause load balancing issues. This imbalance is typically due to solar resources peaking at noon, whereas building loads typically peak in the morning and late afternoon or evenings. Ideally, the combination of on-site generation and localized storage could remedy such load balancing issues while reducing the need for fossil fuels. In response to these issues, this paper contributes a methodology that co-optimizes building designs and district technologies as an integrated community energy system. A distributed evolutionary algorithm is proposed that can navigate over 10154 potential community permutations. This is the first time in literature that a methodology demonstrates the co-optimization of buildings and district energy systems to reduce energy use in buildings and balance loads at this scale. The proposed solution is reproducible and scalable for future community masterplanning studies.",Load balancing (electrical power); Load balancing (computing); Architectural engineering; Zero-energy building; Renewable energy; Building design; Energy planning; Energy system; Computer science; Simulation; Climate change mitigation; Energy engineering; Fossil fuel,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2017.10.044,journal article,Carleton University,ca

Part 1. active storage systems,2016,"Energy consumed by heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) in buildings represents an important part of the global energy consumed in Europe. Thermal energy storage is considered as a promising technology to improve the energy efficiency of these systems, and if incorporated in the building envelope the energy demand can be reduced. Many studies are on applications of thermal energy storage in buildings, but few consider their integration in the building. The inclusion of thermal storage in a functional and constructive way could promote these systems in the commercial and residential building sector, as well as providing user-friendly tools to architects and engineers to help implementation at the design stage.

To achieve this goal, a model of building with 263 kWh daily consumption is studied.

As jurisdictions around the world continue to encourage the deployment of PV systems, module costs have plummeted and vastly improved the competitiveness of PV. As a result, the PV market has grown immensely, reaching $93 billion in global revenues and surpassing 29GW of installed capacity in 2011. The total global capacity of PV installations now exceeds 69GW, with fairly robust growth expected in the future. However, prominent bankruptcy and restructuring cases point to the fact that the PV industry has entered a turbulent phase. As the market continues to mature and government support is ratcheted down, consolidation is expected to intensify and firms will need to innovate even more aggressively in order to succeed. Governments, attempting to promote industrial development, salvage fledgling domestic PV industries, and deploy clean energy systems, are now faced with navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by this rapidly shifting industrial landscape. It is within this context that innovative PV designs and technologies are emerging and prompting discussion around future system designs and appropriate policy support. Building-integrated PV (BIPV), in particular, is attracting increasing attention as a promising niche for further investment and development.This policy insight paper considers the public interest grounds for supporting the development of a Canadian BIPV industry. More precisely, this paper presents an overview of societal benefits relating to this technology as well as opportunities and challenges to deployment and industrial development.

This technology is still not widely used, however. One of the reasons is that its advantages compared to traditional PV modules and solar thermal collectors are unclear. This study addresses the lack of a methodology on how to perform such comparison. It also presents a case study on how this novel approach can be used to demonstrate the actual energy and economic benefits of BIPV/T air systems compared to side-by-side PV modules and solar thermal collectors for residential applications. In this methodology, the thermal energy produced by both systems is transferred into water using a heat exchanger and the concept of annual equivalent useful thermal energy production is used to combine thermal and electrical energy. To perform the analysis, a detailed model of a BIPV/T system was developed and validated against experimental data. Then, the following systems were modeled in TRNSYS: a BIPV/T air system and side-by-side PV modules and liquid solar thermal collectors (PV + T). A case study was performed by simulating the performance of both systems on a 40 m 2 south-facing roof located in Montreal, Canada. The total energy produced by both systems was assessed by converting electricity into heat with various conversion factors. For a factor of 2, the BIPV/T system was found to produce 5–29% more equivalent useful thermal energy than the PV + T system for a water temperature at the heat exchanger inlet corresponding to 10 °C. Under similar operating conditions and for systems operating all year long, the acceptable cost to recover the heat from the BIPV system in order to break even with the cost of the PV + T system was found to be 7000 CAD.",Heat exchanger; Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Heat recovery ventilation; Solar air conditioning; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Process engineering; TRNSYS; Environmental science; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2013.09.040,journal article,Natural Resources Canada,ca

Indeed, our led characterization tests have shown innovative polymers properties in the conversion of photons of UV to the visible range. This both, reduces the degradation of polymers exposed to UV and improves the power generation of PV cells. In fact, it is well known that conventional solar PV cells of terrestrial usage are more receptive to the range of visible than UV.

The PV/T array consists of 25 panels. The warm air generated in the BIPV/T array is considered the source of the heat pump for thermal energy production. Coupling of BIPV/T and ASHP enables a highly efficient heating system in harsh winter conditions. Thermal energy from PV/T array could be stored in the TES (concrete slab or gravel bed beneath the floor) during day and released in night time to enhance the performance of the heat pump. It is shown that using air thermal storage to preheat the outdoor air as an inlet flow to the air source heat pump increases the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump. Consequently, electricity consumption by the ASHP decreases during night. Analytical and numerical methods are used to evaluate design parameters that influence thermal energy production, electrical energy production, heat pump COP and electricity consumed by the heat pump. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to optimize water storage tank size, assuming that the heat pump would only operate during hours of thermal generation from the PV/T array. The preliminary results show that the seasonal COP could be increased from 2.74 to a maximum value of 3.45 for direct coupling of BIPV/T+ASHP without the use of diurnal thermal storage.

Houses with south, south-east and south-west facing roofs are considered eligible for the retrofit since solar irradiation is maximum on south facing surfaces in the northern hemisphere. The PV system is used to produce electricity and supply the electrical demand of the house, with the excess electricity sold to the grid in a net-metering arrangement. The BIPV/T system produces electricity as well as thermal energy to supply the electrical as well as the thermal demands for space and domestic hot water heating. The PV system consists of PV panels installed on the available roof surface while the BIPV/T system adds a heat pump, thermal storage tank, auxiliary heater, domestic hot water heating equipment and hydronic heat delivery system, and replaces the existing heating system in eligible houses. The study predicts the energy savings, GHG emission reductions and tolerable capital costs for regions across Canada. Results indicate that the PV system retrofit yields 3% energy savings and 5% GHG emission reduction, while the BIPV/T system yields 18% energy savings and 17% GHG emission reduction in the Canadian housing stock. While the annual electricity use slightly increases, the fossil fuel use of the eligible houses substantially decreases due to BIPV/T system retrofit.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; HVAC; Engineering; Thermal energy storage; Electricity; Heat pump; Heating system; Photovoltaic system; Waste management; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.06.071,journal article,Dalhousie University,ca
116,127-080-785-707-792,Multistory building envelope: Creative design and enhanced performance,2018,"Abstract The paper presents a comparative study of three strategies in the design of the building envelope of multistory residential buildings combining enhanced energy performance and architectural innovation. The first strategy, serving as base case, employs a high performance flat facade, applied to a building of square layout. The second strategy introduces multifaceted facade geometries, comprising plates of varying tilt angles, to the same building layout, in order to assess the impact of envelope geometry on energy performance. The third approach investigates the impact on energy performance of varying building layouts as applied to flat and multifaceted facades. British Columbia (Canada) serves as location of the study, representing northern climate conditions. For all three design approaches, the most important stage towards achieving high performance is to design an energy efficient building envelope. Comparison of energy performance of complex facade geometries to the base case, indicates that these geometrical patterns do not significantly compromise the thermal performance of the building, while enabling a considerable increase in the electricity generation potential by integrated photovoltaic systems. In folded-plate facade systems, this increase in PV potential is observed on per unit area basis as well as per total facade area. In addition, some of these facade patterns allow time spread of useful electricity generation of the BIPV systems. Combining folded facade geometry with building layouts that allow large south and near south exposure has the potential of enabling energy positive status. While the paper focuses on residential buildings, the methodology can be applied to any type of high-rise building.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Envelope (motion); Architectural engineering; Energy (signal processing); Building envelope; Efficient energy use; Facade; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.11.012,journal article,University of Calgary,ca

The developed device tracks the maximum power point of the BIPV array and limits the output voltage to the level required by the fans. The purpose of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is to automatically match the current and voltage characteristics of the load to the BIPV array's maximum power point at any given illumination. To accomplish this a unique switch mode buck converter was used. The available power from the PV array is a total of approximately 2.5 kW. The two PV sub-arrays supply a voltage up to 220 VDC each and have a maximum power point voltage of 169 VDC. The load consists of two sets of six 133 W, 90 VDC ventilation fans.

118,186-483-603-519-835,Cost-benefit analysis of integrating BIPV-T air systems into energy-efficient homes,2016,"Abstract The market share of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) remains limited. One of the main barriers to its larger adoption is its initial capital cost, as BIPV is generally more expensive than traditional roof or facade mounted photovoltaic modules (PV). Converting BIPV systems into BIPV with thermal energy recovery (BIPV-T) can improve its benefit and competitiveness compared to other solar energy technologies. This benefit is difficult to estimate, however, as it strongly depends on the usefulness of the thermal energy produced and the incremental cost of the technology to recover the heat. This study aims at evaluating the cost-benefit of BIPV-T focusing on systems that use air as the heat recovery fluid and are integrated into all-electric energy-efficient homes located in heating dominated climates. This cost-benefit is evaluated using the concept of break-even cost defined as the maximum incremental cost to convert a BIPV system into a BIPV-T system to break-even with the cost of (a) a BIPV system and (b) side-by-side PV modules and solar thermal collectors (PV + T). To obtain this cost, the useful equivalent energy production of BIPV, BIPV-T and PV + T systems was first obtained for six energy-efficient housing archetypes located in various cities across Canada. Four different heat management scenarios were considered for the BIPV-T system: (1) fresh air preheating, (2) domestic hot water preheating through an air-to-water heat exchanger, (3) domestic hot water and space heating with an air-to-water heat pump and (4) domestic hot water heating (DHW) with a heat pump water heater. Compared to BIPV, BIPV-T systems always produce more useful energy and as a result, the break-even cost compared to a BIPV system was found to be always positive and up to 2700 CAD for a medium 2-storey home located in Montreal. For that same house and considering the price of BIPV equal to that of standard roof-mounted PV modules, the break-even cost of a BIPVT system compared to a PV + T system was estimated at 4200 CAD. If the price of BIPV were to get 10% lower than PV, however, this break-even cost could increase to 6400 CAD.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Heat recovery ventilation; Process engineering; Efficient energy use; Heat pump; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2016.07.005,journal article,Natural Resources Canada,ca

A parametric study is applied to analyze the effects of envelope parameters on the building energy loads for heating, cooling and lighting, required for maintaining growing requirement as obtained in the literature. A base case building of rectangular layout, incorporating conventionally applied insulation and glazing components, is initially analyzed, employing the EnergyPlus simulation program. Insulation and glazing parameters are then modified to minimize energy loads under assumed minimal lighting requirement. This enhanced design forms a base case for analyzing effects of additional design parameters—solar radiation control, air infiltration rate, sky-lighting and the addition of phase change materials—to obtain an enhanced design that minimizes energy loads. A second stage of the investigation applies a high lighting level to the enhanced design and modifies the design parameters to improve performance. A final part of the study is an investigation of the mechanical systems and renewable energy generation. Through the enhancement of building envelope components and day-lighting design, combined heating and cooling load of the low level lighting configuration is reduced by 65% and lighting load by 10%, relative to the base case design.

Despite its advantages to contribute to meeting renewable energy targets and substitute conventional building materials, the diffusion of BIPV has so far remained well below expectations. This paper investigates barriers to and facilitators of adoption based on 43 qualitative interviews with stakeholders across the BIPV value chain. It conceptualizes a framework that classifies the determinants of the adoption processes of renewable energy technologies and of BIPV in particular. Product-specific, stakeholder-specific and institutional barriers are identified. Central product-specific barriers include high initial costs and high complexity. The main stakeholder-specific barriers are low awareness of BIPV, and the reluctance of many architects to adopt BIPV. Institutional barriers refer to political risks. The paper derives recommendations for policy makers and marketers. Successful BIPV policies should create clear incentives for BIPV adopters, either in the form of financial support or inclusion of BIPV in building codes or labels. As for marketing, BIPV suppliers should develop targeted communication strategies towards building owners and architects and offer turn-key solar roofs in order to overcome concerns about the complexity of BIPV.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Consumer behaviour; Diffusion of innovations; Incentive; Photovoltaic system; Business studies; Political risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.04.001,journal article,University of St. Gallen,ch

The adoption of new technologies, such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), but also new and innovative business models such as community solar, have both been identified as relevant drivers. However, the adoption of BIPV is still encountering numerous barriers that hinder its more widespread deployment within the solar PV market. The goal of this research effort was to assess whether community solar as a successful business model for the adoption of conventional solar PV could be equally promising in relation to the further adoption of BIPV. For this purpose, we conducted an experimental survey (n = 413) to compare customers’ willingness to buy a community solar offer exclusively associated with BIPV to a community solar offer solely designed with conventional rooftop solar PV. Our results revealed no significant difference between willingness to buy based on our experimental treatment (BIPV vs. conventional PV), indicating that community solar can be a successful distribution channel for the further adoption of BIPV.

Photovoltaic (PV) is booming with more than 7GW produced in 2008 and will therefore play an important role in the future electricity supply mix. Currently, crystalline silicon (c-Si) dominates the market with a share of about 90%. Reducing the cost per watt peak and energy pay back time of PV was the major concern of the last decade and remains the main challenge today. For that, thin film silicon solar cells has a strong potential because it allies the strength of c-Si (i.e. durability, abundancy, non toxicity) together with reduced material usage, lower temperature processes and monolithic interconnection. One of the technological key points is the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) used for front contact, barrier layer or intermediate reflector. In this paper, we report on the versatility of ZnO grown by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (ZnO LP-CVD) and its application in thin film silicon solar cells. In particular, we focus on the transparency, the morphology of the textured surface and its effects on the light in-coupling for micromorph tandem cells in both the substrate (n-i-p) and superstrate (p-i-n) configurations.

Benefitting from an increasing quality of 3D models of cities, a comprehensive methodology to estimate potential energy generation from visually-acceptable PV, energy use from buildings, and economically viable micro-grid operation is proposed, by combining validated dynamic energy simulation tools into an open-source computational platform. The platform intends to be useful for urban planners and officials in charge of planning a large-scale BIPV installation into an existing neighborhood: simulations are carried out at the city scale, inclusive of facade potential, shading from vegetation and detailed roof shapes with super-structures. Social acceptability is investigated through a novel visual impact assessment methodology and grid integration solutions are analyzed with reference to their associated costs. Under a conservative scenario, a median of 10 kW hAC-electricity / m2 heated floor area per year is available from BIPV production in Geneva (Switzerland), covering 32 % electricity demand for space heating from heat pumps, or, alternatively, almost 10 times the one for space cooling.

The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) located in Switzerland is now facing this problematic, and its sustainable strategy ""Energy Concept 2015-2045"" aims to reduce the energy demand per person by 30%, and the CO2 emissions by 50% in 2035. The university campus is growing-the energy reference area has increased by 25% from 2001, and is expected to continue in the next years- and the actual district heating system (two heat pumps with a combined heat and power facility installed in the early 70s) is facing peak power limitations nowadays. Looking for an answer for this issue, a new concept called Energy Hub is sought for the campus: an intelligent unit able to stock and redistribute energy with different carriers. This paper presents the pre-requisite for a potential energy hub on the site of the EPFL campus in Lausanne: the validation of a dynamic heating energy demand model (correlation factor R2=0.89 compared to monitoring) and a BiPV power plant model for the solar electricity produced on the EPFL buildings roofs (correlation factor R2=0.93 compared to monitoring). Finally, two hypothetical refurbishment of the site, according to the Swiss Minergie and Minergie-P labels, are proposed; they reduce the heating demand of buildings by 38% and 44% respectively. Refurbishments are analysed using actual weather data (average data from the last ten years), as well as future scenarios for 2050, showing the impact of climate change on the building thermal behaviour. © 2015 The Authors.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Sustainable design; Climate change; Civil engineering; Architectural engineering; Heating system; Minergie; Population; Energy hub; Environmental science; Power station,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.776,journal article,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,ch
128,030-343-351-469-090,Life cycle assessment of dynamic building integrated photovoltaics,2016,"Abstract We assess the environmental impact of a dynamic, adaptive, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. Such systems combine the benefits of adaptive shading with facade integrated solar tracking, thus reducing the building energy demand, and simultaneously generating electricity on-site. The inventory for the life cycle assessment (LCA) was acquired using production data, and Energy Plus simulations to calculate the building energy demand. The impact assessment was conducted according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards using the Eco-invent database and openLCA as an analysis tool. The embodied environmental impact of the dynamic BIPV solution is higher than a static alternative due to the added control system, electronics, actuators, and additional supporting structure, resulting in higher life cycle impacts. However when accounting for the systems multi-functionality aspect, i.e. savings through adaptive shading to the building׳s heating, cooling and lighting loads, the embodied environmental impact can be offset, making the ASF an interesting alternative for BIPV. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate modifications to the actuator type, control system, and location and find that none of the investigated parameters overturn the key findings. The analysis ultimately enables us to provide design recommendations for future dynamic BIPV installations.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Impact assessment; Electronics; Environmental impact assessment; Systems engineering; Life-cycle assessment; Facade; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2016.04.017,journal article,ETH Zurich,ch

By conducting an adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) with a representative sample of Swiss homeowners planning to undertake a roof renovation project, we investigate the extent to which financial and non-financial factors drive homeowners’ preferences for PV in Switzerland. We reveal that the color and country of origin of the PV modules are the main drivers for increasing share of preference for PV. In addition, we estimate the price premium that homeowners are willing to pay for building-integrated PV (BIPV) versus rack-mounted PV. We find a premium in willingness to pay of 21.79% for a roof with a BIPV installation in comparison with a rack-mounted PV installation. We further show that an increase in revenues from electricity sales (e.g. via feed-in tariffs), when transparently disclosed over an aggregated time frame, would be almost equally effective in spurring demand for PV as a decrease of initial investment costs (e.g. via one-off investment grants).

To achieve its desired material properties, EVA undergoes a curing reaction during the module encapsulation process. The resulting EVA gel content after encapsulation is an important criterion for the module encapsulation quality control. Normally, the determination of gel content is achieved using a tedious solvent extraction method. In this paper, a fast and nondestructive detection method on the EVA gel content based on the optical reflection is explored. First, the homogeneity of the EVA gel content distribution after the standard EVA encapsulation process is studied. Then, the feasibility of the proposed optical approach applied to transparent modules is investigated. After that, a method is developed to apply it to opaque modules by incorporating a mirror into the module construction. It was found that the haze factor of the reflected light correlates well with the EVA gel content in the opaque modules. This proof-of-concept work could lead to the development of a fast and nondestructive tool for detecting the EVA gel content in both transparent and opaque PV modules, which is promising for integration as an inline diagnostic tool in the module manufacturing line.",Adaptive optics; Curing (chemistry); Materials science; Optical reflection; Material properties; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Opacity; Temperature measurement; Encapsulation (networking),http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jphotov.2015.2397603,journal article,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,ch

132,040-926-306-896-736,"High-resolution, parametric BIPV and electrical systems modeling and design",2019,"Abstract The design of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) often involves complex geometries, non-uniform irradiance conditions and partial shading. This can lead to high energy losses if not considered adequately. This paper presents a BIPV modeling and optimization method which uses a parametric 3D modeling tool, coupled to a high-resolution ray-tracing irradiance simulation and an electrical model based on the single diode model on a subcell level. With the use of a genetic algorithm, electrical interconnections of the modules are optimized for maximum yield. The presented approach allows the simulation and optimization of BIPV in urban environments where complex shading occurs and high electrical mismatch of photovoltaic cells and modules is to be expected. It allows specific geometric design and optimization of photovoltaic installations and their electrical layout. The electrical simulation is validated for both flat and curved thin-film CIGS modules, as well as for two connected thin-film CIGS modules under deferring irradiance and partial shading conditions. The presented method is further applied in a case study on a double-curved roof shell. The results show that by using genetic algorithms the layout can be optimized to minimize the string mismatch losses for BIPV networks with a variety of modules. The detailed electrical simulation allows to quantify effects of module designs and inverter concepts on the system performance. This is demonstrated for the case study, indicating that thin-film modules with longitudinal cell direction outperform modules with orthogonal cell direction by up to 8%. Furthermore, module-integrated bypass diodes show little benefits for the best performing module technologies.

133,055-805-663-248-482,Thermo-mechanical stability of lightweight glass-free photovoltaic modules based on a composite substrate,2018,"Abstract Lightweight PV modules are attractive for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications, especially for renovated buildings, where the additional load bearing capacity is limited. This work focuses on the development of a lightweight, glass-free photovoltaic (PV) module (6 kg/m2) composed of a composite sandwich back-structure and a polymeric front layer. Sandwich structures are usually manufactured with a vacuum bag process and thermosetting liquid glues (e.g. epoxy resin). However, due to the long manufacturing process (> 24 h), liquid adhesives are not compatible with conventional solar industry processes. This work presents the development of a robust glass-free PV module based on a composite sandwich architecture manufactured with a simple process. To simplify the production, the standard thermoset epoxy is substituted by different PV encapsulant foils (EVA, ionomer, polyolefin). The results show that a particular formulation of polyolefin is the ideal adhesive to produce a stable backsheet structure. The use of this polymer with a high thermal conductive core (aluminum honeycomb) allows a reduction of processing time from 24 h to 30 min. The mechanical properties of the composite sandwich structure showed an excellent stability under thermal cycling and damp-heat with only 1% and 3% loss in bending stiffness, respectively. Two-cell lightweight PV modules manufactured with this backsheet show good electrical performance after thermal cycling and damp-heat tests, for which, respectively, an output power loss of only 3% and 2% is observed. This configuration is up scaled to a sixteen-cell module for which a power loss of only 3% is measured after damp-heat.",Composite number; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Composite material; Epoxy; Thermosetting polymer; Temperature cycling; Materials science; Polyolefin; Photovoltaic system; Adhesive,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2018.07.015,journal article,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,ch

One method is to consider building components as multifunctional elements. These elements can perform several functions simultaneously, such as energy and structural aspects. As opposed to traditional sequential design in which each building element performs its own dedicated function. The former requires an integrated approach to prioritise the use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of materials. In this paper, we present three multifunctional elements: a lightweight shell roof, a funicular floor and an adaptive solar facade. We focus on the numerical simulation used to integrate thermally active building systems (TABS) and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) with lightweight structures. We outline a framework for the integration of the multifunctional element analysis with a dynamic building model and the performance factors of a district energy network.

Integrating PV (photovoltaics) in shading systems opens new opportunities for BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics) on facades. A key problem of such systems is mutual shading among PV modules as it can lead to electrical mismatch losses and overheating effects. In this work, we present a new modeling framework, which couples parametric 3D with high-resolution electrical modeling of thin-film PV modules to simulate electric energy yield of geometrically complex PV applications. The developed method is able to predict the shading pattern for individual PV modules with high spatio-temporal resolution, which is of great importance for electrical system design. The methodology is applied to evaluate the performance of different dynamic BIPV shading system configurations, as well as its sensitivity to facade orientation and module arrangement. The analysis shows, that there is a trade-off between tracking performance and mutual shading of modules. Distance between modules is a critical parameter influencing the amount of mutual shading and hence limiting solar irradiation and electricity generation of PV shading systems using solar tracking. Planning of module string configuration, PV cell orientation, and location of bypass diodes according to partial shading conditions, reduces electrical mismatch losses and results in significantly higher electricity generation. The integration of parametric 3D and electrical modeling opens new possibilities for PV system design and dynamic control optimization.

To date, the lack of PV products specifically designed for building integration, considering aesthetics and architectural aspects, is one important limiting factor allowing a massive deployment of PV in the built environment. Architects are continuously asking for new solutions to customize the colour of PV elements to better integrate them into the building skin. Among these colours, white is especially attractive as it is widely used in architecture for its elegance, versatility and fresh look. Until now, white solar modules were not considered to be an option and even never been though to be a technological possibility. ; Nonetheless, CSEM recently developed a new technology to make white solar modules a reality. Furthermore, the new Swiss company called Solaxess is now working on the industrialisation of this very innovative technology and the first products are expecting to be on the market at the end of 2015. The technology is based on the combination of two different elements: a solar cell able to convert solar infrared light into electricity and a selective filter which reflects and diffuse the whole visible spectrum.; Any PV technology based on crystalline silicon can be used as they have a good response in the infrared.

This paper firstly presents an integrated simulation framework to couple photovoltaic electricity generation to building energy savings through adaptive shading. A high-resolution radiance and photovoltaic model calculates the photovoltaic electricity yield while taking into account partial shading between modules. The remaining solar irradiation that penetrates the window is used in a resistance-capacitance building thermal model. A simulation of all possible dynamic configurations is conducted for each hourly time step, of which the most energy efficient configuration is chosen. We then utilise this framework to determine the optimal orientation of the photovoltaic panels to maximise the electricity generation while minimising the building’s heating, lighting and cooling demand. An existing adaptive photovoltaic facade was used as a case study for evaluation. Our results report a 20–80% net energy saving compared to an equivalent static photovoltaic shading system depending on the efficiency of the heating and cooling system. In some cases the Adaptive Solar Facade can almost compensate for the entire energy demand of the office space behind it.

Despite advancements in modelling solar potential, most of these tools provide simple evaluations based on benchmarks, neglecting the effect of uncertain environmental conditions and that of the spatial aggregation of multiple buildings. We argue that including such information in the evaluation process can lead to more robust planning decisions and a fairer allocation of public subsidies. To this end, this paper presents a novel method to incorporate uncertainty in the evaluation of the solar electricity generation potential of existing buildings using a multi-scale approach. It also presents a technique to visualise the results through their integration in a 3D-mapping environment and the use of false-colour overlays at different scales. Using multiple simulation scenarios, the method is able to provide information about confidence intervals of summary statistics of production due to variation in two typical uncertain factors: vegetation and weather. The uncertainty in production introduced by these factors is taken into account through pairwise comparisons of nominal values of indicators, calculating a comprehensive ranking of the energy potential of different spatial locations and a corresponding solar score.

The hourly solar irradiation on each of the building surfaces over one year period is calculated using CitySim simulations, while taking the effects of irradiation threshold for roof and facades into account. With increasing compactness, the annual solar irradiation decreases from 816 to 591 kWh m−2. When passing from dispersed to compact neighbourhoods, the BiPV potential (given as percentage of total area) for facades decreases from 20% to 3%, the STC potential from 85% to 49%, and the passive solar heating potential from 21% to 4%, whereas for roofs the BiPV potential decreases from 94% to 79% and the STC potential from 100% to 95%. The solar potential for roofs, therefore, is much less affected than that for facades by the compactness.

Functioning both as envelope material and on-site electricity generator, BIPV can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Motivated by the current barriers and misconceptions that withhold a widespread integration of BIPV, particularly regarding financial implications and solar exposure levels that are believed to be unfavourable, this paper aims at bringing new knowledge and a rigorous and adaptable method to inform decision-making and promote the use of BIPV in urban renewal processes. Focusing on the architectural design, we here present a methodology to select active (BIPV) surfaces during the retrofitting process based on a trade-off between the self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS) of a building. The approach consists in iteratively identifying surfaces that achieve a varying annual irradiation value (threshold). It also includes the evaluation of the effect of electricity storage systems. The methodology and the results of its application are presented through the comparison of two case studies in Neuchâtel (Switzerland). The outcomes of this new approach for addressing building renovation projects in the urban context can help architects, designers and engineers to better size the installation and the repartition of active surfaces in the renovated thermal envelope. Results show that it is important to take into account a larger range of irradiation levels to choose the active surfaces, especially in high-rise buildings with a greater proportion of facade than roof. In such cases, the irradiation threshold can vary between 600 and 800 kWh/m2·year depending on the strategy adopted in terms of Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) system improvement or storage system implementation.

However, the solar potential in a city can vary depending on the urban morphology. The purpose of this paper is to perform a directional statistical analysis of the distribution of the monthly solar potential of rooftops in the city of Caceres, Spain, in relation to the orientations and slopes of the rooftops. Two residential areas, one in the city center and one on the outskirts of the city, and an industrial zone, all of which exhibit different urban morphologies, have been evaluated.

This HVAC system consists of an air-based photovoltaic–thermal (PVT) collector and a phase change material (PCM) thermal storage unit integrated with a reverse cycle heat pump, in a ducted system. The system was designed for operation during both winter and summer using daytime solar radiation and night-time sky radiative cooling, respectively. The PVT collector heats or cools fresh air from ambient and thereby provides heating or cooling either directly to the indoor space, or to the PCM storage unit. The heat stored in the PCM can be used later to condition the space or precondition the air entering the air handling unit. Analytical models for the PVT collector and PCM unit were developed in order to be easily implemented into a practical building management system (BMS). Experimental studies on the PVT collector and PCM unit were carried out and the data was used to validate the effectiveness of the models. It is shown that there is a good agreement between the model simulation results and experimental test data. A simple optimisation methodology of the operating modes that involve these components is also presented.",HVAC; Engineering; Radiative cooling; Automotive engineering; Thermal energy storage; Zero-energy building; Thermal; Heat pump; Phase-change material; Solar Decathlon; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.02.018,journal article,University UCINF,cl

This study aims to identify relevant barriers that still hinder the greater adoption of BIPV perceived by stakeholders in Singapore, as well as the drivers for BIPV that would lead building sector to adopt BIPV technologies. The study involved five important groups of stakeholders i.e. governmental authorities, building developers, architects, engineers, and PV/BIPV manufacturers to participate in a questionnaire survey. The results identified that on-site generation of clean energy bundled with economic benefits, Green Mark certification, and avoidance of CO2 emissions are the most influential drivers, while long-term payback period, high upfront cost, and low energy conversion efficiency are the three most substantial barriers to BIPV. Furthermore, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine whether the various stakeholder groups perceive the drivers and barriers differently.

Three potential PV systems are examined: large-scale PV (LSPV), building-integrated PV (BIPV), and distributed PV systems used in remote rural areas (which have very low capacities). The results show that in 2020 PV power generation could save 17.4 Mtce fossil energy and 46.5 Tg CO2, compared with 600 MWe coal-fired supercritical units. Also in 2020, the costs of solar electricity could be reduced by approximately 60% as compared to 2010, but would still be 11–74% higher than the current grid prices. The PV electricity costs vary significantly among provinces. In the economically developed eastern provinces, the PV electricity (mainly BIPV) is 0.67–0.86 RMB/kWh. This rate is close to grid parity owing to high grid prices, but the CO2 mitigation cost is high (456–693 RMB/Mg CO2). The PV electricity (mainly LSPV) in solar-resource-rich western provinces has lower cost (0.45–0.75 RMB/kWh) and lower CO2 mitigation cost (172–419 RMB/Mg CO2), but is farther from grid parity due to the low local grid price. From a cost-effective perspective, LSPV in the west provinces should be the first priority in PV deployment strategies, and should receive strong financial support from the government. This study provides a quantitative, province-specific analysis of PV power generation, which can be used to support various PV subsidy policies.",Stand-alone power system; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Economics; Natural resource economics; Grid parity; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Solar power; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Cost of electricity by source,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.027,journal article,Tsinghua University,cn

This paper reports our investigations on the combinations of the vacuum glazing and BIPV integration. Semi-transparent photovoltaic windows can convert solar energy into electricity, but most of absorbed solar heat is transferred into indoor environment which becomes additional cooling load. The proposed vacuum photovoltaic insulated glass unit (VPV IGU) in this paper combines vacuum glazing and solar photovoltaic technologies, which can utilize solar energy and reduce cooling load of buildings at the same time. Various experiments were conducted to evaluate the thermal performance and determine the key characteristics of the VPV IGU in this study. It was found that the VPV IGU can achieve very low total heat gain coefficient (U-value) of around 1.5 W/(m2 K) and block most of undesired solar radiation from penetrating through the window. Compared with a common double-pane glass sheet, the vacuum PV glazing can maintain the indoor environment at a relatively low temperature due to its excellent thermal insulation performance in summer. A detailed simulation study has been conducted by EnergyPlus and Berkeley Lab WINDOW. The simulation work has indicated that the cooling load can be reduced by 14.2% by a south-oriented VPV IGU compared with common glazing products while power generation is not compromised compared with normal BIPV systems. The results show that the application of the VPV IGU has a huge energy saving potential and can minimize the drawback of common PV insulating glass units.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Cooling load; Environmental science; Solar gain; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Glazing; Solar energy; Thermal insulation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12273-018-0464-6,journal article,Hong Kong Polytechnic University,cn

171,011-108-753-256-654,A novel absorptive/reflective solar concentrator for heat and electricity generation: an optical and thermal analysis,2016,"Abstract The crossed compound parabolic concentrator (CCPC) is one of the most efficient non-imaging solar concentrators used as a stationary solar concentrator or as a second stage solar concentrator. In this study, the CCPC is modified to demonstrate for the first time a new generation of solar concentrators working simultaneously as an electricity generator and thermal collector. The CCPC is designed to have two complementary surfaces, one reflective and one absorptive, and is named as an absorptive/reflective CCPC (AR-CCPC). Usually, the height of the CCPC is truncated with a minor sacrifice of the geometric concentration. These truncated surfaces rather than being eliminated are instead replaced with absorbent surfaces to collect heat from solar radiation. The optical efficiency including absorptive/reflective part of the AR-CCPC was simulated and compared for different geometric concentration ratios varying from 3.6× to 4×. It was found that the combined optical efficiency of the AR-CCPC 3.6×/4× remained constant and high all day long and that it had the highest total optical efficiency compared to other concentrators. In addition, the temperature distributions of AR-CCPC surfaces and the assembled solar cell were simulated based on those heat flux boundary conditions. It was shown that the addition of a thermal absorbent surface can increase the wall temperature. The maximum value reached 321.5 K at the front wall under 50° incidence. The experimental verification was also adopted to show the benefits of using absorbent surfaces. The initial results are very promising and significant for the enhancement of solar concentrator systems with lower concentrations.",Solar mirror; Optics; Thermal analysis; Heat flux; Materials science; Thermal; Solar cell; Electricity generation; Absorption (electromagnetic radiation); Nonimaging optics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.02.011,journal article,Harbin Institute of Technology,cn

The proposed method is formulated in terms of ‘modified global indicator’ concept, which was originally proposed to improve reactive power sharing in ac MGs. In this work, the ‘modified global indicator’ concept is extended to coordinate dc MGs, which aims to preserve the main features offered by decentralised control methods such as no need of communication links, central controller or knowledge of the microgrid topology and parameters. This global indicator is inserted between current and voltage variables by adopting a virtual capacitor, which directly produces an output current sharing performance that is less relied on mismatches of the multi-bus network.

In this paper, the heat pipe BIPV/T system with the metal wires filling into the space between the finned heat pipes and insulation has been proposed, which will be expected to enhance the heat transfer and improve the electrical generation of the system.

206,032-457-591-484-730,Interactions between Building Integrated Photovoltaics and Microclimate in Urban Environments,2005,"BIPV(Building Integrated Photovoltaics) has progressed in the past years and become an element to be considered in city planning. BIPV has influence on microclimate in urban environments and the performance of BIPV is also affected by urban climate. The effect of BIPV on urban microclimate can be summarized under the following four aspects. The change of absorptivity and emissivity from original building surface to PV will change urban radiation balance. After installation of PV, building cooling load will be reduced because of PV shading effect, so urban anthropogenic heat also decreases to some extent. Because PV can reduce carbon dioxide emissions which is one of the reasons for urban heat island, BIPV is useful to mitigate this phenomena. The anthropogenic heat will alter after using BIPV, because partial replacement of fossil fuel means to change sensible heat from fossil fuel to solar energy. Different urban microclimate may have various effects on BIPV performance that can be analyzed from two perspectives. Firstly, BIPV performance may decline with the increase of air temperature in densely built areas because many factors in urban areas cause higher temperature than that of the surrounding countryside. Secondly, the change of solar irradiance at the ground level under urban air pollution will lead to the variation of BIPV performance because total solar irradiance usually is reduced and each solar cell has a different spectral response characteristic. The thermal model and performance model of ventilated BIPV according to actual meteorologic data in Tianjin(China) are combined to predict PV temperature and power output in the city of Tianjin. Then, using dynamic building energy model, cooling load is calculated after BIPV installation. The calculation made based in Tianjin shows that it is necessary to pay attention to and further analyze interaction between them to decrease urban pollution, improve BIPV Performance and reduce colling load.

With this method, the power quality of the BIPV system can be enhanced, and the lifetime and reliability are superior by reducing electrolytic capacitors. The low-frequency ripple current caused by the single-phase inverter can be compensated promptly by introducing a current integrator instead of unit feedback in the control strategy of the ALFRCD. With this current integrator, the device is unable to output dc current, which is similar to the function of a capacitor. Compared with the conventional method with high-pass filter, the presented method can achieve better compensation efficiency at most of the low frequencies and the response speed is superior as well. In addition, only one more integrator is needed in the control loop, which indicates the conciseness of the method. The performance is analyzed and the design algorithm is introduced in detail.

The transmission groove of Ag/EAL/1DPCs was gradually red-shifted and broadened by tuning the position and intensity of the OTS; this resulted in a PCE as high as 9.36 ± 0.16% and an average visible transmission (AVT) of 14.31 ± 0.65% in the visible range along with tailor-made color. Simulation results obtained by transfer matrix modeling (TMM) demonstrated that the photoelectric field intensity could be redistributed by controlling the OTS; this led to an enhancement in the absorption of the ST-PSCs.

In urban cities where the building facades are always obscured by surrounding buildings, the determination of sky-diffuse solar irradiance can be complex. Previously, a mathematical model was proposed to estimate the obstructed vertical sky component (OVSC) under various skies by assuming that the obstructions are infinitely long. However, more often, in actual cases, the opposite obstructions are surfaces with different heights in azimuth which can form various irregular skyline patterns. Therefore, this study proposes new methods to determine vertical sky-diffuse solar irradiance on building facades under complex irregular obstructions. Various configurations of irregular obstructions were identified by a proposed quantification method, and the OVSCs were simulated using RADIANCE package. The simulated results were used to correlate with those of infinitely-long urban canyons. Both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based model and simple regression model were proposed to find the correlations between various angles defining the irregular obstruction and the equivalent obstruction angles of corresponding infinitely-long cases. The R2 values of the ANN model and regression model against simulated results using the testing datasets were above 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. Field measurements were carried out for model validations and the R2 value between the proposed methods and the measured readings was 0.8.

Hence the implementations of solar Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in urban China should be carefully assessed from cost-benefit aspects, considering the existence of widely used DSWH systems. This study comprehensively collected the information related to the cost and benefit of DSWH and BIPV systems from literatures and conducted surveys on available roof area of households in Xi’an city with 96 samples. Then 25 year lifetime cost-benefit analyses were performed to demonstrate the comparison between the two solar utilization systems with different roof area. The results indicated that only when the available roof area is more than 6 m2, BIPV system can utilize more solar energy than DSWH could. One typical set of DSWH requiring 3–4 m2 roof area is the optimal setting, and 84% urban China households are capable to install it. BIPV system has an equivalent cost-benefit performance only if the system cost is as low as RMB 0.6/kW h, and with the presence of RMB 1.00/kW h incentive feed-in tariff. If the system cost of BIPV is RMB 0.9/kW h, available roof area of 14 m2 is required but only 18% households can afford it. These results are expected to raise a potential decision making issue between DSWH and BIPV, and provide basis of guideline for implementation of projects of both systems in urban area, particularly in China.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Cost–benefit analysis; Architectural engineering; Virtual power plant; Tariff; Roof; Urban area; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.04.003,journal article,State Grid Corporation of China,cn

Herein, high-performance semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) with excellent features of power generation, being see-through, and infrared reflection of heat dissipation, with promising perspectives for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) are reported. To simultaneously improve average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), formally in a trade-off relationship, of ST-OSCs, new ternary blends with alloy-like near-infrared (NIR) acceptors are employed, which are effective to improve device efficiency while maintaining visible absorption unchanged, resulting in PCEs of 16.8% for opaque devices and 13.1% for semitransparent OSCs (AVT of 22.4% and infrared photon radiation rejection (IRR) of 77%). Further, multifunctional ST-OSCs are realized via introducing simple, yet effective photonic reflectors, together with optical simulation, leading to not only perfect fitting of the visible transmittance peak (555 nm) to the photopic response of the human eye but also an excellent IRR of 90% (780-2500 nm), along with 23% AVT and over 12% PCE.

This vacuum BIPV curtain wall can not only perform on-site power generation, but also significantly reduce the heat transfer through the building envelope with improved thermal insulation. The thermal and power performance of the vacuum PV glazing were investigated by experiments and numerical simulations. A prototype of the vacuum BIPV curtain wall was set up for a short-term outdoor testing to consolidate its thermal and power performance under typical weather conditions of Hong Kong. A comprehensive energy model was then developed to predict the dynamic power and thermal performance of the vacuum BIPV curtain wall to evaluate its annual energy saving potential compared to other advanced window technologies used in buildings in Hong Kong. Based on the simulation model, an optimum design of the vacuum BIPV curtain wall was proposed. In addition, the annual energy-saving potential for a typical high-rise commercial building with the application of miscellaneous BIPV products was estimated using the typical meteorological data. BIPV characteristics were jointly optimized with other passive architectural design parameters and the net building energy demand can be decreased by up to 60% compared with a benchmark office building in Hong Kong.

In BIPV system, conventional building elements can be replaced by special PV modules to perform the same functions; therefore, its advantages include low installation cost, shortened energy payback time and pleasant architectural appearance. The structures of BIPV system can be mainly divided into centralized configuration, string, multi-string, AC module and DC module according to the different combinations of PV array and inverter (converter). AC and DC module configurations have good flexibility, plug-and-play and anti-mismatch performance for each module operates with separate MPPT. However, module configurations are complex, and haven't popularization in market. The centralized and string configurations have more extensive application in practice, but MPPT mismatch is easy to appear especially under partial shadow condition (PSC). This paper proposes a novel MPPT algorithm based on analyzing the output characteristics of PV array under uniform irradiance and PSC in centralized and string configurations. The MPPT algorithm adds partial shadow judging conditions in variable step perturb and observe (P&O) method. The system runs the variable step P&O method to realize MPPT when PV array under uniform irradiance.

However, it can be challenging to interpret the luminance and radiance distribution into the irradiance and illuminance contributions on tilt planes by numerical integrations. This paper proposes a surrogate model that determines the ratio of the diffuse irradiance on an arbitrary tilt plane to that on the unobstructed horizontal plane without the complicated and time-consuming numerical integrations. The model is determined using solar altitude, sky conditions, and the angular distance of the plane (surface normal) and the sun. The proposed model is validated by measurement of the vertical illuminance and irradiance that are taken in 2004 and 2005, and the irradiance on planes of different tilt angles and azimuth directions from February to May in 2015. All measurements were in the 10-minute interval. For vertical planes, the proposed approach gives the ratio of the root mean square errors to the measurement average 1.38% to 2.04% lower than a classical model for irradiance and 3.6% to 4.6% for illuminance, when the Skies can be accurately identified. The model thus accurately interprets the luminance and radiance distributions of the CIE Standard Skies, which can be essential to a fast study for the solar energy potential as well as the thermal and daylight environments under different sky conditions.",Optics; Physics; Daylight; Azimuth; Radiance; Tilt (optics); Illuminance; Irradiance; Luminance; Sky,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2020.04.014,journal article,Guangzhou University,cn

This is almost the longest outdoor test of DSSCs. Performances of DSSCs prepared with two different kinds of dyes are tested. DSSCs with dye Z991 generate about 15% more electricity yearly than those with dye Z907 in the first two years and then the gap is widening because of the better stability of dye Z991. Efficiency of DSSCs with dye Z991 decreases 17% at the first two years and then becomes stable, while DSSCs with dye Z907 are out of use after 4-year outdoor testing. For BIPV use, Pmax increases with the solar irradiance Pi and gets the highest value around 12:00, while the efficiency is almost unchanged from 8:00 to 16:00 as the sun moves. The output of DSSCs increases not linearly with the irradiance, especially under irradiance lower than 20 Wh, implying that efficiency measured under AM1.5G conditions is not a crucial indicator to evaluate the performance of DSSCs. The total energy yields of DSSCs throughout the years are slightly higher than that of pc-Si cell with the same installed capacity, and DSSCs generate 15–20% more electricity from May to August when temperature is higher and irradiance is lower. The results show potential application in outdoor BIPV, especially in hot and humid climate, although larger exposed area is still required to attain the same installed capacity with pc-Si cell.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Materials science; Hot and humid; Total energy; Irradiance; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Engineering physics; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2018.03.017,journal article,Chinese Academy of Sciences,cn

We find that for the emerging types of glass/glass and insulating glass modules, the measurement error between the IEC61215 method and the thermocouple direct measurements on the actual cell can be as high as 15 °C. To address this problem, a new NOCT measurement method for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules is proposed. In the new method, the standard reference environment has the same total irradiance (800 W/m2), ambient temperature (20 °C), and wind speed (1 m/s) as IEC61215 but with a closed circuit and a resistive load to ensure the module operates at the maximum power point. This takes into account both the photoelectrical and photothermal conversion effect simultaneously. The cell temperature is measured directly using several thermocouples encapsulated into the BIPV modules at a certain sampling point. The average cell operating temperature for the whole module is further determined by the infrared thermovision measurements after calibration. In addition, the simulated BIPV house was built to simulate the actual installation environment.

These two elements directly influence the cooling effort of PV layers and as a result, the related electrical/thermal/overall efficiency. This paper conducts a critical review on the essential thermal absorbers and their integration methods for the currently-available PV modules for the purpose of producing the combined PV/T modules. A brief overview of different PV/T technologies is initially summarized, including aspects of their structure, efficiencies, thermal governing expressions and their applications. Seven different types of thermal absorbers and four corresponding integration methods are subsequently discussed and summarized in terms of their advantages/disadvantages and the associated application for various PV/T modules. Compared to traditional thermal absorbers, such as sheet-and-tube structure, rectangular tunnel with or without fins/grooves and flat-plate tube, these four types, i.e. micro-channel heat pipe array/heat mat, extruded heat exchanger, roll-bond heat exchanger and cotton wick structure, are promising due to the significant enhancement in terms of efficiency, structure, weight, and cost etc. The appropriate or suitable integration method varies in different cases, i.e. the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) based lamination method seems the best option for integration of PV layer with thermal absorber when compared with other conventional methods, such as direct contact, thermal adhesive and mechanical fixing. Finally, suggestions for further research topics are proposed from five aspects.

230,051-059-602-969-895,An improved method for direct incident solar radiation calculation from hourly solar insolation data in building energy simulation,2020,"Abstract Solar radiation considerably influences the energy consumption of buildings and the power production of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. Hourly solar insolation (Wh/m2), represented as the amount of solar irradiance collected on the ground during a 1-h period, is the most common solar radiation data available and widely used in weather files applied in building energy modeling programs (BEMPs). Because the solar beam and position vary over time, the use of hourly insolation data as the input might result in errors in the estimation of the direct incident solar radiation on a particular surface. In this study, methods used in BEMPs for direct incident solar radiation calculations are first analyzed, and an improved method adopting a new algorithm for estimating the solar irradiance is proposed. The algorithm assumes that the solar irradiance changes linearly within a 1-h period and can be estimated based on the solar irradiance at the half clock and slope. The collected direct normal solar irradiance data of 2016 from eight solar radiation stations in China were used to demonstrate the proposed method and evaluate its performance by comparing the results with those from three conventional methods used in BEMPs along with the ground truth measurements. In addition, in this study, factors affecting the accuracy of the calculation results are explored. The results of the estimated direct incident solar radiation show that the proposed method achieves the best accuracy, followed by the methods used in DOE-2, EnergyPlus, and DeST. The proposed method guarantees that the hourly direct solar insolation will remain the same and reflects the variation in the direct solar irradiance across a 1-h time frame. The proposed method can be adopted in BEMPs to improve the accuracy of the solar radiation calculation, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulated building performance and the BIPV production.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Ground truth; Meteorology; Radiation; Power (physics); Building energy simulation; Energy consumption; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110425,journal article,Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture,cn

Four different roofs are used to assess the impacts of BIPV on the building’s heating-and-cooling loads; namely ventilated air-gap BIPV, non-ventilated (closed) air-gap BIPV, closeroof mounted BIPV, and the conventional roof with no PV and no air gap. One-dimensional transient models of four cases are derived to evaluate the PV performances and building cooling-and-heating loads across the different roofs in order to select the appropriate PV building integration method in Tianjin, China. The simulation results show that the PV roof with ventilated air-gap is suitable for the application in summer because this integration leads to the low cooling load and high PV conversion efficiency. The PV roof with ventilation air-gap has a high time lag and small decrement factor in comparison with other three roofs and has the same heat gain as the cool roof of absorptance 0.4.

Due to the excellent thermal insulation performance of vacuum glazing, the integration of STPV and vacuum glazing provides the potential to achieve the best energy-efficient performance by the low solar heat gain of the PV modules and low heat losses of the vacuum glazing. However, the determination of a suitable glazing of a building in different locations must consider the climate background. In this paper, the thermal performance of the proposed vacuum photovoltaic insulated glass unit (VPV IGU) in different climate zones has been investigated. The simulation work has shown that the vacuum PV glazing can provide a significant energy saving potential in Harbin, Beijing, Wuhan and Hong Kong, which represent the severe cold, cold, hot summer and cold winter, and hot summer and warm winter regions, respectively. However, it is not suitable for the moderate climatic region like Kunming. The results have indicated the advantages of utilizing the vacuum PV glazing in different climates as well as its limitations.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal; Cooling load; Environmental science; Solar gain; Photovoltaic system; Glazing; Solar energy; Engineering physics; Thermal insulation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2019.01.190,journal article,Hong Kong Polytechnic University,cn

Compared to conventional DSCs that can only be operated under front-side illumination, bifacial design will allow DSCs to generate up to 50% more electrical power. Besides, bifacial DSCs can be easily made transparent and may find broad applications in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) as power-generating windows and roof panels. Transparent counter electrodes (CEs) are key to the fabrication of bifacial DSCs. However, despite the fact that conventional Pt CE can be made transparent, its high cost and scarce source may hinder the large-scale application of DSCs.

The capacity of the solar system on the rooftop normally will be enough to power the LED light loads in commercial buildings, even for high rise buildings. In order to power heavy loads such as air conditioning and EV charging stations, extra power are required, which can be obtained from the BIPV on the sidewall, glass window, or adjacent parking lots. To ensure the stable bus voltage and continuous operation of the DC microgrid, a suitable energy storage unit and two way AC/DC invertors are needed.

The actual output of a PV module in the field is a function of orientation, total irradiance, spectral irradiance, wind speed, air temperature, soiling and various system-related losses. In urban areas, the attenuation of solar radiation due to air pollution is obvious, and the solar spectral content subsequently changes. The urban air temperature is higher than that in the surrounding countryside, and the wind speed in urban areas is usually less than that in rural areas. Three different models of PV power are used to investigate the effect of urban climate on PV performance. The results show that the dimming of solar radiation in the urban environment is the main reason for the decrease of PV module output using the climatic data of urban and rural sites in Mexico City for year 2003. The urban PV conversion efficiency is higher than that of the rural PV system because the PV module temperature in the urban areas is slightly lower than that in the rural areas in the case.

This system is capable of cooling PV panels by ventilation/exhaust air in winter/summer and generating electricity. A performance evaluation criterion ( P E C ) is defined in this study to examine the overall performance of the considered BIPVT system. Then, the mentioned methods are used to identify a relationship between the input and output parameters of the system. The parameter P E C is considered as the essential output of the system, while the input parameters are the length, width, and depth of the duct underneath the PV panels and air mass flow rate. To evaluate the accuracy of produced outputs, two statistical indices of R2 and RMSE are used. As a result, all models presented excellent performance where the ANN model could slightly perform better performance compared to GP and ANFIS. Finally, the equations belonging to ANN and GP models are derived, and the GP presents a more suitable formula, due to its simplicity of use, simplicity of concept, and robustness.",Genetic programming; Computational intelligence; Mean squared error; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Artificial neural network; Control theory; Robustness (computer science),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2019.03.016,journal article,Yunnan Normal University,cn

The results demonstrate that heat transfer by convection, radiation, and conduction in the air gaps between PV panels and the building envelope can be simulated in the EnergyPlus environment when these air gaps are in the “air conditioning zone.” Nevertheless, in most cases, particularly on the rooftop, the air gaps between the PV panels and the building envelope cannot be set as the “air conditioning zone.” Therefore, in this case, none of the EnergyPlus models are appropriate to simulate the effect that PV panels have on the rooftop temperature. However, all the terms of the Heat Balance Model, including the absorbed direct and diffuse solar radiation, net long-wave radiation with the air and surroundings, convective exchange with the outside air, and conduction flux in or out of the surface, can still be used to calculate the temperature and heat flux within the BIPV’s air gap.",Air conditioning; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Aerospace engineering; Meteorology; Heat flux; Building envelope; Thermal; Roof; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Heat transfer,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/9020567,journal article,Southeast University,cn
267,076-594-792-831-548,Dynamical simulation of building integrated photovoltaic thermoelectric wall system: Balancing calculation speed and accuracy,2017,"Abstract Building integrated photovoltaic thermoelectric (BIPVTE) wall system is highly energy efficient and self-adaptive to the environment. This sophisticated system is supported by the co-work of PV module for solar radiation transformation, air gap for thermal dissipation and thermoelectric radiant panel system (TERP) for active radiant cooling/heating. The purpose of this study is to develop an accurate and fast simulation method of this complex system which could be beneficial for system design, control and optimization for application. The present study upgraded the PV model by considering the variable resistance due to Peltier Effect in thermoelectric module. A new non-uniform time step model was proposed which can provide an improved and more efficient system simulation. The non-uniform time step solution of BIPVTE system was validated by comparing with both uniform time step solution and experimental data. The parametric studies on time step h and superposition number N under uniform time step solution, as well as two linear deviation coefficients d T and d G under non-uniform time step solution, were respectively analyzed. In uniform time step solution, the simulation time step h and parameter N should be properly chosen to balance simulation speed and accuracy. However, in non-uniform time step, numerical investigations demonstrated that simulation accuracy can be kept within an acceptable range even when linear deviation coefficients were large enough. The algorithm can be further accelerated by adopting Gauss-Berntsen-Espelid or Gauess-Kronrod rule in numerical integral calculation. The comparative and case study in this research has shown the validity and robustness of the proposed non-uniform time step model, which could be a useful tool for further work on BIPVTE as well as other building systems.",Thermoelectric generator; Parametric statistics; Engineering; Thermoelectric cooling; Radiant cooling; Systems design; Photovoltaic system; Simulation; Thermoelectric effect; Control theory; Dynamical simulation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.024,journal article,Hunan University,cn

As a result, solar energy efficiency can be increased significantly while heating/cooling load of buildings can be reduced. Thus, BIPVT application provide a promising method to significantly reduce building energy consumption for developing low-energy or even zero-energy buildings. This paper presents a review on BIPVT development and focuses on the designs of integrated solar systems with building facades and its influence on electricity generation, thermal performance of PV cells, and energy consumption of buildings for space heating and cooling.

These patterned perovskite films exhibited near-neutral-color and tunable semitransparency, which meet the requisites of semitransparent solar cells for BIPVs application. O2 plasma etching of the microsphere template could effectively improve the active layer average visible transmission (AVT), and the existence of the SiO2 nanoscaffold effectively smoothed the internal trade-off of active layer AVT and device PCE.

Thus, this paper reviewed direct transmittance degradation works of PV module surface glasses, and employed several integrated and improved experiment and model methods to investigate the correlation effects of PM2.5 deposition dynamics, tilt angles, surface conditions and self-cleaning TiO2 nanocoating on glasses. Series of physical models from ambient aerosol concentration to deposition density and transmittance reduction were extended or newly developed. Measured and modeled data could inter-validate with each other and literature results. The usage condition of Al-Hasan model was discovered as 0 a p 0.10 for particle projected-area fraction under clustering particle projected-area fraction a p c p ≤ 5 % . Ranging from 0 to 18.7 μg/cm2, deposition densities with the most reductions (50–91%) were found under the combination of wet and nanocoating conditions due to effects of water film and low adhesive force. Generally, the average deposition densities decreased 19–47% with the increase of each 30° tilt angle for different surface properties. Finally, six linear empirical models were obtained with decreasing slopes of 0.001544–0.001841 between fine aerosol deposition density and transmittance ratio.

Herein, we report a type of low band gap STPSCs with high color rendering index (CRI), which can be modulated by one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs). To flatten transmitted light and eliminate chromatic aberration, the 1DPCs were integrated on top of the STPSCs as a wavelength-dependent filter. We have designed the centre wavelength of 1DPC at 520 nm to level the concavo-convex transmittance spectrum induced by the absorption of PSBTBT:PC60BM.

It delivered alternative design in terms of material, colour, texture, shape, size, architectural design, installation method, array connection, hypothetical system application, and solar coverage. Two common design variants i.e. (a) the STF cladding system and (b) the prefabricated STF wall system were described respectively for existing and new low-rise building typologies. Interaction of inclination, orientation, and insolation were discussed for the optimum STF position on the building. Four currently available methods for installation of such STF with buildings were summarized and three typical array connection methods were identified. The decentralized connection was recommended for different types of STF hot water systems.

A typical rural building having a roof area of 60 sq. m is considered for the study. It was observed that the considered roof area could accommodate, nearly 7 kW BIPV system, and on the other side, most buildings seen in Malaysia are of the roof based constructed at different roof pitches. Considering this, a SSPR-BIPV is proposed and analyzed in seven different pitched roofs (the steepness of roof slopes are 15°, 18°, 22°, 30°, 35°, 40°, and 45°) under the tropical weather conditions in Malaysia. As per the study constraints, the 7 kW CdTe BIPV under seven different pitched roofs is capable of generating electricity within the range of 9510 to 7710 kWh. Performance ratio and energy losses for seven pitched roofs were identified to be in the range of 74.92 to 76.37% and − 23.63 to − 25.08% respectively. From the results, it is observed that in a BIPV system, as the building roof pitch increases, the energy yields and performance ratios tend to decrease, thereby increasing the overall energy losses. Hence, this study reveals that there exists a considerable influence of pitched roof over the BIPV performance and suggests using lower roof pitch angles during the installation of BIPV roof especially in the case tropical weather conditions.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Meteorology; Roof; Roof pitch; Performance ratio; Medicine public health; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Cadmium telluride photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s43088-019-0003-2,journal article,City University of Hong Kong,cn

Flexibility sources include the renewable energy, i.e. building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) and wind turbine, and thermal energy storages, i.e. air handling unit cooling storage tank (ACST) and domestic hot water tank (DHWT). Parametric analysis has been conducted based on all proposed flexibility indicators with respect to the renewable energy capacity, the volume of both the ACST and the DHWT, and the set point temperature for recharging the DHWT. From our results, to meet the annual energy balance, this NZEB should be equipped with BIPVs and an 8 kW wind turbine, while these BIPVs should be installed on four walls and the roof (totally 306 m2 BIPVs). Considering the grid feed-in tariff in Hong Kong, the NZEB will get the net annual operational income at 646.3 HK$/m2.a. Flexibility factors indicate the flexibility of the energy storage systems for storing the surplus renewable energy (REe) and fulfilling the building demand. During the charging process, the increase of the REe capacity shows positive impact on flexibility factors of both the ACST and the DHWT. In the case when BIPVs are on four walls, with respect to the increase of the rated wind turbine capacity from 0 to 8 kW, the flexibility factor of the ACST increases from 0.49 to 0.58 during the charging process, whereas it decreases from -0.51 to -0.59 during the discharging process. Meanwhile, the flexibility factor of the DHWT increases from 0.32 to 0.57. Moreover, with respect to the increase of the ACST volume from 0.5 m3 to 2.5 m3, the flexibility factor increases from -0.23 to 0.17 considering both the charging and the discharging processes. With respect to the increase of the DHWT volume from 1 m3 to 3 m3, the flexibility factor increases from 0.32 to 0.74. With respect to the increase of the set point temperature for recharging the DHWT from 65 oC to 100 oC, the flexibility factor increases from 0.32 to 0.82. Moreover, in comparison with the nighttime interaction between the building and the vehicle, the daytime interaction will reduce the reliance on the grid for charging the EV. Moreover, the energy interaction between the building and the vehicle will be enhanced.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Zero-energy building; Renewable energy; Electric vehicle; Energy balance; Flexibility (engineering); Environmental science; Energy storage,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2019.02.005,journal article,Hong Kong Polytechnic University,cn

However, the contradiction of achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) whilst keeping rational average visible transmittance (AVT) leads to the development of ST-OSCs lagging behind that of traditional opaque OSCs. In this work, chemically precipitated SnO2 colloidal particles are used as an electron collection interlayer in ST-OSCs for the first time. Due to the excellent transparency and high reflective index, the SnO2 layer can effectively tune the light-distribution of the incident light within the whole multilayered ST-OSCs.

285,089-912-824-023-848,Coupling an artificial neuron network daylighting model and building energy simulation for vacuum photovoltaic glazing,2020,"Abstract Window plays an essential role in the indoor environment and building energy consumption. As an innovative building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) window, the vacuum PV glazing was proposed to provide excellent thermal performance and utilize renewable energy. However, the daylighting performance of the vacuum PV glazing and the effect on energy consumption have not been thoroughly investigated. Most whole building energy simulation used the daylighting calculation based on Daylight Factor (DF) method, which fails to address realistic calculation for direct sunlight through complex glazing materials. In this study, a RADIANCE model was developed and validated to adequately represent the daylight behaviour of a vacuum cadmium telluride photovoltaic glazing with a three-layer structure. However, RADIANCE will consume too many computational resources for a whole year simulation. Therefore, an artificial neuron network (ANN) model was trained based on the weather conditions and the RADIANCE simulation results to predict the interior illuminance. Subsequently, a preprocessing coupling method is proposed to determine the lighting consumption of a typical office with the vacuum PV glazing. The performance evaluation of the ANN model indicates that it can predict the illuminance level with higher accuracy than the daylighting calculation methods in EnergyPlus. Therefore, the ANN model can adequately address the complex daylighting response of the vacuum PV glazing.

287,094-174-327-852-839,Techno-economic feasibility analysis of solar photovoltaic power generation for buildings,2016,"Abstract The Building Added PV (BAPV) plays an important role for developing green buildings. This work conducts a techno-economic feasibility study of BAPV for commercial and residential building hybrid energy systems (HES). A component sizing model based on the optimal power dispatch simulations with the objective of minimum cost of energy (COE) is used to determine the component sizes of HES. The techno-economic performances of two HES composed of BAPV and batteries for residential and commercial buildings are investigated. The results show that the use of BAPV in the commercial building HES can reduce the electricity bill for customers owing to the government subsidies on PV as well as due to the similar characteristics of the load profile as to the solar radiation profile. However, due to temporal dislocation between the load and solar radiation patterns, the use of PV in the residential building HES may significantly increase the initial capital cost and replacement cost of battery, resulting in the COE of the residential building HES with BAPV even higher than the residential electricity price. The techno-economic performances of battery (e.g., the lifetime and capital cost) have more effect on the COE of the residential building HES than that of PV.",Engineering; Capital cost; Automotive engineering; Work (electrical); Electricity; Load profile; Component sizing; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Simulation; Battery (electricity),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.07.199,journal article,Xi'an Jiaotong University,cn

Many researchers found high BIGCP potential in many cities. But this paper emphasized that two important facts are usually ignored. These facts will probably limit the willingness to invest (WTI) in BIGCPs. This problem is referred as an Available Investment Area for BIGCP Installation (AIABI) problem. This paper worked out a way to estimate the restriction brought by the AIABI problem in a certain urban district by applying high definition remote sensing images and signal processing methods. A cased study is carried out in Beijing city, the result shows that there exists a least-acceptable-SPBP range in which a large proportion of the total AIABIs will not be invested in the case.

292,099-929-007-429-147,An experimental study of the thermal performance of a novel photovoltaic double-skin facade in Hong Kong,2013,"Abstract Ventilated building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades can not only generate electricity at the locations of buildings themselves but if designed optimally, such facades can also reduce the respective heat gains and heat losses in summer and winter via the building envelope. The development of a novel ventilated BIPV double-skin facade (DSF), constituted by a see-through amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV module and an inward opening window, is reported in this paper. In order to enhance ventilation, an air-flow duct, 400 mm in depth is situated between the outside PV module and the inside window. This ventilation design can remove much of the waste heat generated by the PV module energy conversion processes, and thus bring down the operating temperature of the solar cells. Infrared thermal imaging was adopted in relation to the ventilated PV-DSF to visually demonstrate this ventilating effect. It was found that the air temperature at the outlet louver is higher than that at the inlet louver by 2.2–2.3 °C. The thermal performance of PV-DSFs operating in different modes was studied and compared. The results showed that the ventilated PV-DSF provides the lowest solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), while the non-ventilated PV-DSF better reduces heat loss. Based on the experimental results, the optimum operation strategy for the PV-DSF under different weather conditions has been determined and proposed. This novel PV-DSF is more suitable for sub-tropical climates because it results in a much lower SHGC than that of a low-e coating DSF.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Waste heat; Building envelope; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Louver; Double-skin facade; Environmental science; Solar gain; Photovoltaic system; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2013.08.031,journal article,Hong Kong Polytechnic University,cn

300,112-243-913-872-207,e-BIM: a BIM-centric design and analysis software for Building Integrated Photovoltaics,2018,"Abstract Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has gained large popularity in recent years. However, its effective design remains challenging. Different but often related design concerns regarding BIPV are normally treated, in the current practice, in multiple but separated design phases with different models and tools. The complexities in maintaining the consistency between those models employed in separated phases make seamless PV and building integration, one of the major concerns of BIPV design, far from satisfying. To this end, this paper proposes a uniform BIPV design platform: e-BIM, which is a BIM (Building Information Modelling) - centric BIPV design and analysis software platform, to address the related design concerns via one uniform data model. The concept of domain-specific models is introduced to allow the external PV-related models to be integrated into the uniform model. To simplify model synchronization problem, the domain-specific views corresponding to specific domains are provided to designers and meanwhile a synchronization engine is developed to automate data consistency among views and the uniform model. The current prototype is developed based on Autodesk® Revit and tested in a practical BIPV application. The results show that this platform achieves seamless BIPV design for architects, PV system designers and electricity professionals. Moreover, compared to the initial BIPV design, the photovoltaic system cost is reduced by 11.7% and the transmission losses by 2.95%.",Synchronization (computer science); Building-integrated photovoltaics; Consistency (database systems); Systems engineering; Electricity; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Building information modeling; Data consistency; Data model,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2017.10.020,journal article,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,cn

However, the efficiency of BPSCs is still much lower than their theoretical efficiency. In general, interface band alignment is regarded as the vital factor of the BPSCs whereas only few reports on enhancing perovskite film quality. In this work, highly efficient BPSCs were fabricated by improving the crystallization process of CH3NH3PbBr3 with the assistance of anti-solvents. A new anti-solvent of diphenyl ether (DPE) was developed for its strong interaction with the solvents in the perovskite precursor solution. By using the anti-solvent of DPE, trap-state density of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film is reduced and the electron lifetime is enhanced along with the large-grain crystals compared with the samples from conventional anti-solvent of chlorobenzene. Upon preliminary optimization, the efficiencies of typical and semitransparent BPSCs are improved to as high as 9.54% and 7.51%, respectively. Optical absorption measurement demonstrates that the cell without metal electrode shows 80% transparency in the wavelength range of 550–1000 nm that is perfect for greenhouse vegetation. Considering that the cell absorbs light in the blue spectrum before 550 nm, it offers very high solar cell efficiency with only 17.8% of total photons, while over 60% of total photons can transmit through for photosynthesis if a transparent electrode can be obtained such as indium doped SnO2.",Perovskite (structure); Electrode; Solar cell efficiency; Materials science; Perovskite solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Indium; Doping; Absorption (electromagnetic radiation),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jechem.2018.10.001,journal article,Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics,cn

343,004-900-483-483-819,The energy performance of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) by determination of optimal building envelope,2021,"Abstract Building form and envelope surfaces play a significant role in energy performance assessment and the generated energy potential of the building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) concept in early-stage design. To increase the energy efficiency level, form factor (FF) is proposed as a helpful tool that provides a strong relationship between the exposed surface areas and the treated floor area (TFA). This research aims to develop a methodology for a parametric study to determine the related balance between the TFA and the required BIPV area in the form enclosure to meet specific primary energy demand (SPED) according to the international Passive House standard (PHS). Therefore, various form types, including square, rectangle, L, and T shapes, derived from four modular cubes, are classified based on the same FF. Optimal form selection per group is conducted through BIPV potential evaluation for the exposed surfaces in six different orientations separately. Thereafter, the BIPV efficiency level for the optimized forms is examined using its utilization factor and coverage index scenarios based on the facade and roof combination priorities. The results indicate that the generated energy sufficiency is affected by the form configuration and its orientation. Additionally, the optimal BIPV-based FF value of 0.71 implies the priority of roof-based scenarios for less BIPV utilization. Finally, the correlation value for the BIPV coverage index relative to the total envelope for the optimal forms and orientation is higher than 0.92, which can be extended to other forms in different locations as an assessment model.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Primary energy; Envelope (motion); Automotive engineering; Building envelope; Efficient energy use; Roof; Facade; Passive house; Environmental science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107856,journal article,Eastern Mediterranean University,cy

In BIPV systems the air gap is responsible to cool the PVs and remove excess heat to avoid building overheating. The ventilation of the air gap can be natural or mechanical. However, naturally ventilated systems are less studied although they have important advantages over the mechanically ventilated ones, such as the avoidance of extra energy of the fans, maintenance and noise. The present Part I of this study presents an experimental based thermal analysis of a naturally ventilated vertical BIPV system. A series of experiments on a custom made BIPV system were carried in real outdoor conditions as well as indoors with the use of a large scale solar simulator to measure the thermal characteristics of the system and its thermal behaviour. Indoor experiments were performed to avoid external disturbances from wind that may occur outside. The results show that an open-ended air gap of 0.1 m can create adequate air flow on naturally ventilated systems and can ensure low PV temperatures to avoid PV efficiency decrease. The experimental data are then used to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficients to fit the real conditions of the BIPV systems.

As the building sector accounts for almost 40% of the energy consumption in Europe, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems gain peoples’ interest lately concerning the replacement of the conventional construction materials of the buildings envelope with photovoltaic (PV) panels which can serve at the same time as construction material and energy producer. The aim of this study is to present an overview of the available published research on the BIPV systems and identify the barriers and risks associated with the application of BIPV and discuss the future perspectives and solutions through recommendations for future research and development. The most important barriers of the BIPV systems are the feed in tariff implementation, the public acceptance, the governmental economic support in terms of subsidies and technical aspects like the power losses and the architectural considerations. The future perspectives of the BIPV systems proposed are based on the barriers discussed. It is stated that new solutions in the PV industry are many and various and there is room for improvement regarding design, configuration, ventilation, positioning, guidelines, monitoring and performance prediction. In total, more than 100 articles have been identified and analysed since 2000. Many of these articles have a predominant focus on the investigation of the performance of the system, and the ventilation of the PV panels in BIPV applications for electricity production, due to the negative role of the temperature on PVs electrical efficiency, and the heat transfer behavior of the system.

The reduction of the energy demand for cooling, heating and artificial lighting is now mandatory for new buildings and for large renovations of existing buildings, in order to comply with these new regulations. This is a challenge since the majority of the current building stock is consisted by over than 25-year-old existing buildings, which are inefficient in terms of energy needs.

At the same time, these simulations aim to analyse whether the system can cover the energy needs of the aforementioned building. The investigation focuses into calculating the facade’s electricity production potential, whilst its passive contribution is recorded through the reduction potential of the building’s energy needs for heating, cooling and artificial lighting.

The present study (second part) presents a simulation based thermal analysis of a naturally ventilated vertical BIPV system. The simulation model is created using the developed equations for the estimation of the convective heat transfer coefficients presented in the first part of the present study, and the model is validated with the use of experimental data shown in the first part as well.

These parameters are not easy to be investigated experimentally and their investigation would be very time consuming. The simulation model has a good agreement with the experimental results. The results shown that an air gap of 0.1 m can create adequate air flow on naturally ventilated systems and can ensure low PV temperatures to avoid efficiency decrease.

However, glass replacement with advanced PV concepts needs thorough energy and environmental assessment, since it took more than a millennium to produce transparent window glass of high visibility. Despite the many published studies in relation to the performance of each technology, there are limited comparative investigations of the proposed PV integration options and the most appropriate integration solutions for different climatic regions. Here, we report, for the first time, on the energy performance of four BIPVs that control solar radiation through windows and their effect on the built environment for three different climatic zones. The evaluation was done through TRNSYS simulations and calculation of representative indexes associated with thermal and visual comfort. A BIPV-flexibility index, given as a ratio of self-sufficiency to self-consumption, is proposed as a figure of merit for the assessment of each BIPV technology’s electricity production and its effect on building energy performance. The findings clearly show that BIPVs could substantially contribute to the transition to zero energy buildings due to their passive energy benefits (up to 43% savings) in addition to their electricity production. Opaque module, PV shadings and PV windows optimize the BIPV-flexibility index (up to 0.57) for cold, moderate and hot climates, with acceptable indoor thermal (up to 54% of time) and visual (up to 83% of time) comfort.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Visibility; Built environment; Automotive engineering; Zero-energy building; Electricity; TRNSYS; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117017,journal article,Czech Technical University in Prague,cz

Retrofit of conditioning equipment in old buildings will lead to a significant increase in energy consumption, if the buildings are not upgraded (insulated, air tightened, etc.). Furthermore, although China is leading in the production of photovoltaic modules, the utilization of building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) is not yet implemented at a significant scale. However, the prevailing building typology is characterized by a southerly orientation, a favourable floor-to-roof ratio, a rather simple building envelope, appropriate floor plans and not at least a roof structure able to carry PV systems. Climates in many areas in China are more favourable for solar energy generation than in other countries, such as Germany, where BIPV is already widely utilized. This paper investigates the potentials of energy upgrade of a building typology representative for a large percentage of the existing Chinese building stock for 26 climates in China. Strategies of “efficiency” (energy-upgrade measures), “consistency” (renewable energy generation and revitalisation of existing structures) as well as “sufficiency” (reduced comfort requirements) are discussed as the pillars of a strong concept for sustainable upgrade of China's existing building stock.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Carbon neutrality; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Building envelope; Roof; Energy consumption; Demolition; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2017.07.088,journal article,University of Stuttgart,de
360,002-200-512-781-517,Open innovation using satellite imagery for initial site assessment of solar photovoltaic projects,2020,"One of the responses to the fight against climate change by the developing world has been the large-scale adoption of solar energy. The adoption of solar energy in countries like India is propagating mainly through the development of energy producing photovoltaic farms. The realization of solar energy producing sites involves complex decisions and processes in the selection of sites whose knowhow may not rest with all the stakeholders supporting (e.g., banks financing the project) the industry value chain. In this article, we use the region of Bangalore in India as the case study to present how open innovation using satellite imagery can provide the necessary granularity to specifically aid in an independent initial assessment of the solar photovoltaic sites. We utilize the established analytical hierarchy process over the information extracted from open satellite data to calculate an overall site suitability index. The index takes into account the topographical, climatic, and environmental factors. Our results explain how the intervention of satellite imagery-based big data analytics can help in buying the confidence of investors in the solar industry value chain.

This is done analyzing the operational data of 6868 installations. Three main questions are posed. How much energy do they produce? What level of performance is associated to their production? Which are the key parameters that most influence their quality? During the year 2010, the PV systems in France have produced a mean annual energy of 1163 kWh/kWp. As a whole, the orientation of PV generators causes energy productions to be some 7% inferior to optimally oriented PV systems. The mean Performance Ratio is 76% and the mean Performance Index is 85%. That is to say, the energy produced by a typical PV system in France is 15% inferior to the energy produced by a very high quality PV system. On average, the real power of the PV modules falls 4.9% below its corresponding nominal power announced on the manufacturer's datasheet. A brief analysis by PV modules technology has led to relevant observations about two technologies in particular. On the one hand, the PV systems equipped with heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) modules show performances higher than average. On the other hand, the systems equipped with the copper indium (di)selenide (CIS) modules show a real power that is 16% lower than their nominal value.",Electrical engineering; Engineering; Power (physics); Automotive engineering; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Production (economics); Datasheet; Performance ratio; Performance index; Nominal power (photovoltaic); Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2011.10.018,journal article,ETSI,de
364,033-336-341-421-687,Load mismatch of grid-connected photovoltaic systems: Review of the effects and analysis in an urban context,2013,"Abstract The mismatch between generated and consumed electricity is a relevant topic of the energy and economic assessment of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Due to the load mismatch some amount of PV electricity may be exported to the grid because the electrical demand is temporarily lower than production, whereas a consumption, which is higher than production and/or that does not match the available PV generation, will require to be supplemented by the public grid electricity. The presence of the load mismatch can cause the effect of disadvantageously purchasing electricity from the grid and/or squandering the unexploited PV energy. If only a very small part of the PV generation is used to supply the household appliances, benefits may not compensate disbursements. Moreover, instead of giving a benefit to the community, an amount of surplus electricity generated by a great number of PV systems may represent a significant problem for the grid operators. In this paper the study of the effect of the load mismatch on the energy and economic analysis of the PV potential of a district of a city of the South Italy is presented. The authors propose an appropriate methodology able to explore the architectural morphology of buildings and evaluate both the solar potential of PV systems installed on roofs and the economic aspects involved. The impact on the grid of the electricity generated by large-scale PV systems, which is a worry to the traditional electricity producers and dispatchers, seems to be much less than expected if the economic viability is considered in the assessment of the real penetration of PV systems. The results, which confirmed the importance of the role played by the load mismatch, suggest that only the generation of the PV electricity that is really consumed by the PV producers should be wisely supported by the economic incentives.",Stand-alone power system; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Environmental economics; Grid parity; Grid; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Electricity; Purchasing; Incentive; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.12.035,journal article,University of Palermo,de
365,035-257-472-409-781,An improved photographic method to estimate the shading effect of obstructions,2012,"Abstract A new photographic method is presented to evaluate the shading effects of obstructions on surfaces exposed to the sun. The method overcomes the difficulties caused by the need to accurately describe the surrounding objects to estimate the shading effects by means of the usual tools that use the spatial reconstruction of obstructions or cylindrical or polar suncharts. The photographs of the surrounding objects are used as the background on which the solar disc is depicted at the various hours of the day. In this way it is easily detectable if the sun is visible from the place where the photographs were taken or if the surrounding obstructions obscure the sun. In spite of the complex mathematical background of the new method, the practical application of the procedure is very simple, and only requires the measurements of three angles for each photograph. The procedure permits to verify the suitability of a generic site for solar exploitation; its main benefit is the simplicity of use and the transparency of the obtained results. This method is particularly useful to evaluate the technical feasibility of small solar systems installed on the buildings of densely urbanised cities. The accuracy of the method was tested by performing an experimental verification in the field. For this purpose, the sun was photographed at different hours of the day. The photographed solar discs and the calculated sun’s positions were compared. The differences between the photographed and calculated sun’s positions corresponded to small time lags that do not exceed few minutes in the worst case. To further investigate the reliability of the proposed method, the impact of image distortion, which always affects all methods that use cameras to get information about the photographed reality, was also examined.",Shading; Simplicity (photography); Solar access; Sun path; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Reliability (statistics); Distortion (optics); Remote sensing; Transparency (human–computer interaction),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2012.07.027,journal article,University of Palermo,de

This contribution investigates the challenges and benefits of using bifacial solar cells in vertical installations. We show that those cells get up to 13% more irradiance compared to optimum tilted south facing monofacial modules in Germany. The role of the n-layer in thin amorphous bifacial single-junction cells intended to be used as bifacial cells in BIPV applications is investigated. In contrast to the superstrate cell design, a transparent n-layer and back contact play a key role to achieve high bifaciality. We therefore increased the transparency of the n-layer by adding CO2, increasing the PH3 flow in the deposition gas and tested different thicknesses. With those measures, we reached a bifaciality of 98% for short-circuit current density and 99% for open-circuit voltage.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optics; Wafer; Voltage; Thin film; Materials science; Current density; Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Amorphous solid,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ese3.116,journal article,University of Oldenburg,de

These low temperature solar cells show a significant improvement in performance upon post-deposition annealing (up to two hours) in all parameters of the current-voltage (JV) curves of the solar cell, resulting in an efficiency increase up to 34% (relative). Comparison of external quantum efficiencies of p- and n-side illuminated cells, as well as varied absorber layer thicknesses and reverse bias voltage, suggest that the collection of minority carriers are mainly improved upon annealing. Both the increase of the built-in field in the solar cell and improvement in the electronic properties of the absorber layer were found to contribute to an improved carrier collection and solar cell performance.",Voltage; Materials science; Amorphous silicon; Solar cell; Reverse bias; Electronic properties; Optoelectronics; Quantum dot solar cell; Polymer solar cell; Annealing (metallurgy),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2015.12.290,journal article,Forschungszentrum Jülich,de

Textured silicon wafers can be utilized for light management, however, this is typically not compatible with perovskite solution processing. Here, we instead employ a textured light management (LM) foil on the front-side of a tandem solar cell processed on a wafer with a planar front-side and textured back-side. This way the PCE of monolithic, 2-terminal perovskite/silicon-heterojunction tandem solar cells is significantly improved from 23.4% to 25.5%. Furthermore, we validate an advanced numerical model for our fabricated device and use it to optically optimize a number of device designs with textures at different interfaces with respect to the PCE and energy yield. These simulations predict a slightly lower optimal bandgap of the perovskite top cell in a textured device as compared to a flat one and demonstrate strong interdependency between the bandgap and the texture position in the monolithic stack. We estimate the PCE potential for the best performing both-side textured device to be 32.5% for a perovskite bandgap of 1.66 eV. Furthermore, the results show that under perpendicular illumination conditions, for optimized designs, the LM foil on top of the cell performs only slightly better than a flat anti-reflective coating. However, under diffuse illumination, the benefits of the LM foil are much greater. Finally, we calculate the energy yield for the different device designs, based on true weather data for three different locations throughout the year, taking direct as well as diffuse illumination fully into account. The results further confirm the benefits of front-side texture, even more for BIPV applications. Overall, devices built on a both-side textured silicon wafer perform best. However, we show that devices with textured LM foils on the cell's front-side are a highly efficient alternative.",Perovskite (structure); Wafer; Materials science; Tandem; Coating; Optoelectronics; Silicon; FOIL method; Heterojunction; Stack (abstract data type),http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ee02469c,journal article,Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin,de

One or two diode equivalent circuits have been widely used even though some mathematical difficulties were found dealing with implicit equations. In this paper, a new model based on a simple rational function, which does not contain any implicit exponential form, is presented. The model was conceived in order to be used with thin-film photovoltaic modules, whose current–voltage curves are characterised by very smooth shapes. The parameters of the model are evaluated by means of the derivatives of the issued characteristics in the short circuit and open circuit points at standard rating conditions, and assuming that the calculated current–voltage curve contains the rated maximum power point of the simulated panel. The capability of the model to calculate the current–voltage characteristic for values of the solar irradiance and cell temperature far from the standard rating conditions was verified for various thin-film technologies, such as CIS, CIGS, amorphous silicon, tandem and triple-junctions photovoltaic modules. A comparison with the results obtained by another rational model and other two-diode models, which were used to simulate the electrical behaviour of thin-film photovoltaic modules, is also presented.",Maximum power principle; Topology; Engineering; Equivalent circuit; Electronic engineering; Amorphous silicon; Systems design; Photovoltaic system; Short circuit; Rational function; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.037,journal article,University of Palermo,de

In particular, recent researches look with interest at the installation of hybrid system PV/T.

The determination of the operating temperature is a key parameter for the assessment of the actual performance of photovoltaic panels. In the literature, it is possible to find different correlations that evaluate the referring to standard test conditions and/or applying some theoretical simplifications/assumptions. Nevertheless, the application of these different correlations, for the same conditions, does not lead to unequivocal results.

Moreover, when the purpose is calculating the realistic amount of the electricity demand of a city that can be covered by the photovoltaic generation, it is necessary to estimate the number of photovoltaic systems whose installation is economically advantageous. Such a topic requires an economic analysis, which is affected by the number of energy and economic parameters involved and the values assigned to them to perform calculations. Some parameters are perfectly known and unvarying, like the paid incentives. Adversely, some parameters, like the efficiency degradation of photovoltaic panels, can only be supposed. Other parameters require some information that is specifically related to each particular photovoltaic system. With the aim of estimating the influence of the manifold energy and economic parameters that characterize how photovoltaic penetration develops in urban areas, a specific study was conducted for a city in the south of Italy.

A typical solution, which uses aluminum electrolytic capacitors for such applications, is assumed to be one of the weakest links in power electronic systems, therefore, also becoming one of the lifetime bottlenecks of power electronic systems. Various passive and active capacitive dc-link solutions have been proposed intending to improve the reliability of the dc-links qualitatively, making great effort to diverting the instantaneous pulsating power into extra reliable storage components. In this paper, a generic topology derivation method for single-phase power converters with active capacitive dc-link integrated has been proposed, which can derive all existing topologies, and identify a few new topologies. According to the synthesis results, the main achievements in research on capacitive dc-link solutions are reviewed and presented chronologically as well as thematically ordered. Furthermore, the reliability-oriented design procedure is applied to size the chip area of active switching devices and the passive components to fulfill a specific lifetime target and system specification, as well as compare the overall capacitive energy storage, energy buffer ratio, and the cost of different solutions.

Only five of them were found to have a comprehensive life cycle and impact coverage, and their analyses highlighted the importance of (i) including the entire life cycle of the PV system, in particular the often-omitted disposal stage, and (ii) assessing all relevant impact categories and not just climate change or energy requirements to minimise the risk of burden-shifting. Out of the 28 studies embracing ecodesign considerations in parts of the PV life cycle, the analysis of the eleven of them addressing primary energy demand during module production suggests that electricity consumption during the metal deposition processes is a top contributor and should be prioritised by PV technology developers. A similar analysis of the ten studies having included the balance of system components (BOS) in the assessments showed that these contribute significantly to most environmental impact categories. Beyond recommending that stakeholders in the PV field rely on LCA to support decision-making and to guide scientific research and technological development, we strongly advocate LCA practitioners to include the entire PV system, including the BOS, to identify ecodesign opportunities without risking potential burden-shifting across the different parts of the system and across impact categories.",Primary energy; Environmental economics; Consumption (economics); Business; Environmental impact assessment; Electricity; Life-cycle assessment; Ecodesign; Balance of system; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2016.05.048,journal article,Technical University of Denmark,dk
378,060-993-169-697-911,Modelling the heat dynamics of building integrated and ventilated photovoltaic modules,2009,"Abstract This paper deals with mathematical modelling of the heat transfer of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules. The efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) module and its temperature are negatively correlated. It is therefore of interest to lower the temperature of the PV module by increasing the heat transfer from the PV module. The experiment and data originate from a test reference module the EC-JRC Ispra. The set-up provides the opportunity of changing physical parameters, the ventilation speed and the type of air flow, and this makes it possible to determine the preferable set-up. To identify best set-up, grey-box models consisting of stochastic differential equations are applied. The models are first order stochastic state space models. Maximum likelihood estimation and the extended Kalman filter are applied in the parameter estimation phase. To validate the estimated models, plots of the residuals and autocorrelation functions of the residuals are analyzed. The analysis has revealed that it is necessary to use non-linear state space models in order to obtain a satisfactory description of the PV module temperature, and in order to be able to distinguish the variations in the set-up. The heat transfer is increased when the forced ventilation velocity is increased, while the change in type of air flow does not have as striking influence. The residual analysis show that the best description of the PV module temperature is obtained when fins, disturbing the laminar flow and making it turbulent, are applied in the set-up combined with high level of air flow. The improved description by the model is mainly seen in periods with high solar radiation.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Airflow; Engineering; Stochastic modelling; Estimation theory; Turbulence; Photovoltaic system; Heat transfer; Control theory; Laminar flow,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.05.018,journal article,Technical University of Denmark,dk

Building-integrated solar water heating (SWH) systems are effective ways to use renewable energy in buildings. Impediments, such as security concerns, aesthetics and functionality, make it difficult to apply SWH systems in high-rise buildings. At present, only China uses SWH systems on a large scale in such buildings. What are China’s experiences and lessons learned in applying SWH systems in high-rises? Are these experiences scalable to other countries? This study used a combination of field investigation, literature review and case study to summarize 36 systems that had been in operation for 1–14 years. System types, collector types, installation methods, types of auxiliary heat sources, economic performance and various basic principles were summarized. The economic performance of SWH systems in high-rise buildings was analyzed and verified by a case study in Shanghai. The results show that the installation of SWH systems in high-rise buildings is feasible and reliable.

It compares the energy output and the cost savings of building-integrated photovoltaic (BiPV), solar thermal and BiPVT systems of different sizes but with the same initial investment cost. We find that the BiPVT system in cold climates can be competitive with traditional technologies only under certain conditions, such as favourable electricity to heat price ratio or a particular range of collector areas. A similar system in warmer climates, however, fares quite well against both solar thermal and BiPV technologies.

In 2011 Italy became the first world market; however, Germany has even the primacy of accumulated power. The installed capacity amounted to 10.000 MW according to data of Italian Manager of Energy Services (GSE) against 1.000 MW in 2010 and 3.000 the beginning of 2011. The projections of GSE include the achievement of the 12.000 MW by the end of the year with more than 350.000 running plants. In a nearly mature market, cost related issues and technical difficulties are encountered in particular in the successful integration within a sensitive and consolidated built environment. The research presented aims to investigate the possible results of an effective use of Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), choosing existing buildings in the city of Bellinzona (Canton Ticino, CH) as case studies. Bellinzona presents similar characteristics to small Northern Italian cities in terms of built environment characteristic and climate conditions. The theoretical framework for the analysis is the one proposed initially for low energy and nearly net zero energy buildings (NZEB). Although this type of analysis has been developed, in particular, for building with high penetration of renewable energy sources generation (up to 100% of the energy consumed), it seems worth investigating the dynamic interaction of building energy demand, on-site generation and grid with similar tools, because of the necessity of achieving low energy demand also in retrofitted existing buildings in a near future.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Built environment; Architectural engineering; Zero-energy building; Renewable energy; Mature market; Distributed generation; Nameplate capacity,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2012.11.113,journal article,SUPSI,ee
387,025-960-535-603-322,Flat roof integration of a-Si triple junction modules laminated together with flexible polyolefin membranes,2007,"Abstract In BIPV design (Building Integrated PV) with crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, ventilation is important in order to keep cells as cool as possible. To allow good ventilation it is therefore generally preferable to mount the modules separated from the existing roof. In the case of sloped roofs, the modules are superimposed onto the existing roof and for flat roofs separated tilted mounting structures designed to withstand wind loads are used instead, but both are not real building integrations. In this paper we analyse the behaviour and the energy yield of a 15.36 kWp PV system based on flexible triple junction amorphous silicon modules laminated together with a single ply roofing system. The PV plant has been integrated on a flat roof of a professional school located south of Switzerland. A significant part of the data analysis is done in comparison with three small open-rack plants (reference plants) installed near the integrated plant. An important result was that the thermally insulated nearly horizontal modules showed temperatures higher than for modules mounted on an open-rack structure, especially for sunny days. This created higher power losses due to negative temperature coefficients. On the other hand, the higher temperature reached the level where the main degradation mechanism of a-Si modules could be reversed and better thermal annealing could be observed. This conclusion was arrived at after a direct performance comparison of the thermally insulated plant and the open-rack a-Si reference plant, which has the same module and orientation as the main plant. In order to better understand the thermally insulated nearly horizontal plant behaviour, we analysed and quantified the irradiation difference and optical losses with respect to a 20° tilted open-rack c-Si power plant. Optical losses for nearly horizontal modules were significant during the winter, partially affecting their low performance. As a main result, the final energy yield of the thermally insulated a-Si plant was almost comparable to a 20° tilted open-rack c-Si power plant, despite the lower irradiance and higher reflection losses with respect to the latter. Accordingly, compared to c-Si modules, the a-Si technology represents a better choice for thermal insulated BIPV.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Materials science; Roof; Triple junction; Flat roof; Crystalline silicon; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Power station; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2007.04.010,journal article,SUPSI,ee
388,030-975-569-894-458,A calculation method for the BIPV potential of Swiss facades at LOD2.5 in urban areas: A case from Ticino region,2020,"Abstract To unlock the solar energy integration in the built environment, the assessment of the BIPV potential for existing urban areas represents a preliminary fundamental step. In fact, by knowing the BIPV potential, urban decision makers can support the integration of PV in the urban environment with appropriate policies to achieve energy transition goals. Specifically, to assess urban BIPV potential of facades, not only solar radiation algorithms are required but also the identification of construction facade characteristics, which significantly affect the real BIPV exploitability. However, current urban BIPV facade cadastres generally do not considered such characteristics since the majority of them are based on 3D city-models at LOD2, meaning that the influence of architectural elements (such as windows, balconies, etc.) is not evaluated. Therefore, this work proposes a calculation method capable to match existing solar radiation analysis at LOD2 with architectural characteristics of facades, through building typological indicators, in order to better estimate the urban BIPV potential of facades, namely defined as LOD2.5, without the need of LOD3 models, which involve important investments at urban level. The results demonstrate that such method can improve the current estimations and it creates the framework to be suitably implemented within city solar planning tools.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Built environment; Architectural engineering; Seven Management and Planning Tools; Energy transition; Urban studies; Facade; Computer science; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2019.11.062,journal article,SUPSI,ee

Today, photovoltaics (PV) is one of the most reliable technologies for integration in the built environment, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is introducing a different notion of ‘energy integrability’ into practice. The difficulty of undertaking, from the first design stages, a really integrative approach towards energy (PV and building requirements) is today still one of the strongest barriers to the rise of the BIPV market. Likewise, the same uncertainty affects the economic aspects, objects of this paper, since BIPV systems are often evaluated similar to conventional installations.

For both technologies, the model was validated against three years of data collected from the outdoor test field at Supsi for a conventional ventilated free-rack mounted installation (south-facing, 45°-tilt). In the present work, we expand the simulations to model the performance of the same technologies for the same location and to include building integrated (BIPV) installation conditions. For simplicity, we consider two extreme cases: (a) a south-facing facade installation (90°-tilt) and (b) a perfectly horizontal one (0°-tilt). The angle-of-incidence response of the modules is then used to quantify reflection losses, which are very significant in summer and winter for the facade and horizontal installation, respectively. Further, compared to ventilated ones, fully integrated PV modules exhibit average operating temperatures that can reach an offset of +20 °C in days of clear sky conditions. This offset is used to model the operating temperatures – and performance losses – of the BIPV modules. The model, whose main limitation is the focus on days of clear sky conditions, allows assessing the distinguished contributions, and peculiar time-phases, of each effect to the yearly energy performance of the devices under test.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Offset (computer science); Amorphous silicon; Crystalline silicon; Facade; Performance ratio; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Amorphous solid; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.02.035,journal article,SUPSI,ee

The paper aims at evaluating the impact of the operating cell temperature on the modules’ performance for different investigating cases. Two models were used to calculate the junctions’ temperatures of the modules under operation: the simplified Nominal Operating Temperature (NOCT) model and the Equivalent Cell Temperature (ECT). The first was used in a simplified version and the second was used for all modules, regardless of its limitations for thin film technologies. The two models agree well and give satisfactory results regardless of the inclination, integration solution or technology. The difference between the NOCT and ECT calculated average daily temperatures of the modules was found to be less than 5–6 °C, with only one exception. As expected, fully integrated modules exhibit higher temperatures. In terms of performance, the integrated c-Si modules, regardless of their inclination, ranked lower – in terms of energy yield – than the integrated and ventilated a-Si/a-Si modules, for which the high operating temperatures proved to be beneficial. The inclination of 90° was found to be ideal for Lugano for both c-Si and a-Si/a-Si modules.","Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Operating temperature; Science, technology and society; Amorphous silicon; Crystalline silicon; Imagination; Photovoltaic system; Mechanical engineering",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.097,journal article,SUPSI,ee

Therefore, this paper presents a novel integrated 3D GIS-based methodology for the evaluation of this potential, especially for the Swiss context and multi-family house buildings by combining data for the evaluation of the envelope retrofit potential and by increasing the accuracy of the assessment of the BIPV facade potential beyond typical LOD2. Moreover, it includes GIS-based tools for evaluating the BIPV facade potential, the energy retrofit potential of envelopes, and the annual and seasonal urban energy balance.

Firstly, simplified calculation model is deduced for the heat transfer across the PV wall via average outdoor temperature. Secondly, the thermal effect of gap depth and geometry on the performance of a BIPV is parametrically optimized and evaluated for a range of envelope shapes. The numerical model results were validated by energy simulations of TRNSYS and EnergyPlus; CFD simulation by PHOENICS software to explain the thermal behavior of the air in the gap. At constant conditions for a flat vertical PV wall with an air gap from 3 cm to 40 cm with 3 cm increment, the increase of air gap till 22 cm depth reduced the heat gain through the envelope, at wider air gaps heat gain increased due to Laminar convective heat flow.

Supplying sufficient electrical energy, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is one of the major concerns of policymakers and scientists all over the world. In Saudi Arabia, local authorities are increasingly aware of the necessity of reducing the environmental impact of nonrenewable energy by exploring alternative sustainable energy sources and improving buildings’ energy efficiency. Recently, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology has been regarded as a promising technology for generating instantaneous sustainable energy for buildings. To achieve a substantial contribution regarding zero energy buildings, solar energy should be widely used in residential buildings within the urban context. This paper examines how to achieve an appropriate model for integrating photovoltaics on the rooftop of residential buildings in Hail city to provide alternative energy sources. The estimated rooftop areas in Hail city, utilizable for PV application were calculated. Using PV*SOL simulation software, the performance ratio and the system efficiency, as well as the annual energy output in several tilt angles, were determined and presented. The amount of energy expected when using all effective roof area in the city was also calculated. The amount of CO2 emissions that could be reduced as a result of using a PV system was estimated. The results show a significant area of rooftop suitable for PV system in residential buildings in Hail city, which exceeds 9 million square meters. On the other hand, the performance ratio and the system efficiency are affected by the tilt angle of the PV module, where the efficiency increases with higher tilt angle, this is due to the PV module temperature, where, with the decrease in the PV module temperature its efficiency increases. The results indicate that the 30° tilt PV produced the highest amount of energy, whereas the 75° tilt PV records the smallest one although it achieves the best possible efficiency. There is a significant amount of energy produced from the use of all residential rooftops in Hail, and there is also a significant reduction in the amount of CO2 emissions.

Integration of PV modules into building envelope could reduce the annual production of electricity by a rate above 5% and negatively influence lifetime due to thermal stresses induced by high operation temperatures above 100°C in the case of warm climate and above 90°C in moderate climate. Two configurations of unglazed PV-T collectors (low-tech, high-tech) and their ability to eliminate overheating of BIPV module have been discussed. Simulation study on combined heat and electricity production from given BIPV-T collectors has been presented for three typical applications (5°C: primary circuits of heat pumps; 15°C: cold water preheating; 25°C: pool water preheating). Thermal output of unglazed BIPV-T collectors is up to 10 times higher than electricity. Electricity production could be up to 25% higher than BIPV (without cooling) for warm climate and up to 15% in moderate climate.",Computer cooling; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Meteorology; Building envelope; Thermal; Electricity; Overheating (electricity); Building integration; Environmental science; Electricity generation; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/686393,journal article,"Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Technicka 4, 166 07 Prague, Czech Republic",cz

This work presents an attempt to determine the amount of exergy generated by an optimally inclined double-storied BIPV thermal system by considering the actual cyclic nature of insolation, surrounding air temperature, PV cell temperature, intermediate slab temperature, and the chamber temperature. The insolation value, which is computed by an anisotropic sky model along with these cyclic variables, is used for solving the set of governing differential equations for evaluating the exergy of the system. Other influencing parameters of the BIPV thermal systems such as air changes in both chambers, packing factor of PV module, the orientation of PV module, and thickness of the intermediate slab are considered for finding its effect on the total exergy of the system. Numerical results show that for packing factor more than 0.6, there is no significant change in total heat exergy with respect to the inclination angle. For packing factor more than 0.3, the generation of electrical exergy exceeds the heat exergy, and the overall exergy of BIPVT system decreases with rise in packing factor (βm) up to 0.3 and then rises nonlinearly.</jats:p>",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Exergy; Thermal; Environmental science; Insolation; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4048301,journal article,Indian Institutes of Technology,in

The so-called Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Power Systems (GCPS) prevail in urban zones, together with Building-integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV); whose performance and energy efficiency depends on different factors. The main aspects include those related to the solar radiation available in the geographical location of the facility, the climate, the orientation and tilt of the used surfaces, the appropriate design of the system and the quality of the components. Therefore, several methods have been proposed to try to predict the influence of the aforementioned variables on the amount of electricity produced. However, the majority are very tedious to implement or do not take the specific characteristics of the system into account.

439,004-752-231-619-060,Experimental study of cooling BIPV modules by forced convection in the air channel,2014,"Abstract The efficiency of photovoltaic systems depends mainly on the cell temperature. Frequently, the PV collectors are installed on the top of the building. One cost effective method to regulate the temperature of rooftop integrated photovoltaic panels is to provide an open air channel beneath the panel. The cell temperature of these PV modules is very much influenced by the capability of ventilating this channel. The ventilation may be modified by different factors such as the wind velocity, the air gap size, and the forced convection induced by a fan or by a conventional air conditioning system. This paper describes an experimental setup to study the influence of the air gap size and the forced ventilation on the cell temperature (and consequently on the electrical efficiency of the PV module) of a BIPV configuration, for different values of the incident solar radiation, ambient temperatures, and aspect ratios, as well as for several forced ventilation conditions. Semi empirical correlations for the Ross coefficient, module temperature, electrical efficiency, and power output are proposed, showing a good agreement with respect to experimental measurements. A critical channel aspect ratio close to 0.11 can be considered to minimize overheating of PV devices. For a duct velocity V v  = 6 m/s, a power output increase of 19% is observed over the natural ventilation case ( V v  = 0.5 m/s).",Air conditioning; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Nuclear engineering; Electrical efficiency; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Ventilation (architecture); Duct (flow); Natural ventilation; Forced convection; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.079,journal article,Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena,co

However, the stochastic characteristic of PV power generation and load challenges the optimal dispatch of the BIPV. This paper proposes an optimal scheduling strategy of BIPV microgrid considering virtual energy storage (VES), which intends to further improve the operating economy of a BIPV microgrid. Firstly, existing research findings and gaps in this research area were analyzed. Then, the mathematical model of each unit in the system was created, meanwhile, the air conditioner-based VES (ACVES) model and electric water heater-based VES (EWHVES) model are built by exploiting the heat/cold storage capability of building and the electric water heater, respectively. Next, the optimal scheduling model considering the VES is designed. Finally, the optimal scheduling model is solved by CPLEX to obtain the optimal scheduling strategy that reduces the operating cost of the system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can reduce the operating cost of the system. Furthermore, the VES shows the potential to replace the battery energy storage system.</jats:p>",Reliability engineering; Microgrid; Optimal scheduling; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Energy storage,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10186176,journal article,School of Electric EngineeringZhengzhou UniversityNo.100 Science AvenueZhengzhouPeople's Republic of China,cn

In this paper, the BIPV technology has been reviewed, in terms of its performance, efficiency and power generation capacity. Specifically, the applications of the BIPV in tropical climate regions have been discussed, together with its prospects and challenges. For these schemes to be implemented in a tropical climatic region, the following issues must be considered: 1) Certain studies must be done relating to electrical load demand, predicted PV output, location of the buildings and its integration and constraints associated with roof design; 2) For the highest energy production from solar PV, the solar collectors need to be with the right tilt depending on the location; 3) Design criteria such as safety, efficiency, durability, flexibility and constructive issues need to be considered; 4) The government of such countries must train electricians and carpenters on PV installations; 5) The BIPV roofing must perform same function as normal roofing materials, such as noise protection, water tightness, insulation and climate protection, and 6) As practiced around the world, these countries must establish design standards for the BIPV.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architectural engineering; Roof; Production (economics); Flexibility (engineering); Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Function (engineering); Electrical load,http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijpeds.v12.i1.pp474-488,journal article,University of Hafr-Albatin,sa

The proposed recursive integral PI can be applied to obtain precise current of the inverter. The improved ip-iq algorithm put forward in the paper could detect the harmonics and reactive power rapidly. The introduction of network voltage forward feed control can effectively restrain system disturbance. Also, it enables BIPV inverter not only to provide active energy, but also to suppress the harmonics and reactive power current brought in by load. Prototype development based on simulation results and photovoltaic experimental platform verifies the correctness and effectiveness of BIPV inverters control method.

PV researchers from various countries have been working for several years to optimize these systems. Sustainable BIPV system has many benefits such as the building itself becomes the PV support structure, and the BIPV components displace the conventional building materials and labor cost, thereby reducing the net installed cost of the PV system and building construction. It also provides on-site generation of electricity and architectural elegance, which increases the market acceptance of the buildings. The BIPV systems can be interfaced with the available utility grid or used as off-grid systems.

452,008-513-983-335-965,Novel Scheme For Extracting Maximum Power From Facade Based Building Integrated Photovoltaics,2019,"Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is expected to be a viable option for Near Zero/Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB/ZEB) in urban areas. Facade based BIPV gives an option to the builders/designers to manage human comfort as well as improve aesthetics by including more than one BIPV technology or transparency. However, from the power generation point of view, these PV modules are subjected to non-uniform illumination and partial shading due to the surrounding buildings and structures in most urban scenario. The power output of the modules do not match with the inverter rating as they do not receive direct radiation for most of the day and implementation of vertical orientation minimizes the power generation. Connecting them in series and/or parallel is an option to increase power generation, but it is highly influenced by the shading patterns. In this paper, we propose a scheme of power converters for BIPV in which each module is connected to a dedicated DC-DC power converter and the outputs of several such converters are connected to a grid-tied inverter. This configuration helps to track the maximum global power of the BIPV modules and inject power into the grid even under the partially shaded conditions. The simulation results for a two-module case show that the designed controller can handle sudden changes in radiation level in either or both of the BIPV technologies and stable state MPP(Maximum Power Point) condition is achieved. The impact of the fill factor on the dynamic response of the controller for various BIPV technologies is also highlighted.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Inverter; Maximum power principle; Electrical engineering; Zero-energy building; Facade; Maximum power point tracking; Computer science; Electricity generation; Solar micro-inverter,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc40753.2019.8981393,conference article,Indian Institutes of Technology,in

Both systems are coupled with small size Wind Turbines (WTs), to reduce the fluctuations of power production typical of solar systems. A case study is presented, referred to a hotel building, where a reversible air-to-water Heat Pump (HP) is used for space heating and cooling, driven by the electric energy provided by PV collectors and WTs. In order to optimize the HP performance in cooling mode, thermal energy is recovered from the HP desuperheater and used to produce domestic hot water (DHW). A two-stage cascade cycle HP for DHW purposes was also investigated, as a further alternative. The systems were simulated by means of a dynamic simulation model, developed in TRNSYS.

The studied modules are south-oriented and installed at three different tilt angles 5angles (5˚, 25˚, and 90˚) in a desert environment in Dubai, UAE. The study period is 2 years, and the examined parameters are daily energy yields (normalized to module area), temperaturerelated losses, and soiling losses. It was noted that the final yield of a module highly depends on a combination of module efficiency in addition to the afore-mentioned performance losses. Normalized yield of bifacial monocrystalline modules are found to be the highest, while the standard polycrystalline modules generally show higher yield than other technologies due to a combination of temperature effect and soiling effect. Though CdTe and CIGS modules have the lowest temperature coefficients, their daily yields are affected by higher soiling losses. The effect of tilt angle on the temperature loss is relatively low, however, it is significant on the soiling losses where lower tilt angles result in higher soiling loss. The findings in this study can assist in selecting the most suitable technology, type and tilt angle of PV module for Building-Applied Photovoltaic (BAPV) and Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) installations in different regions.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells; Monocrystalline silicon; Tilt (optics); Desert environment; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Temperature measurement,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.2018.8547298,conference article,"Research & Development Center, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE)",ae

Methods The performance was thereafter compared with that of Amorphous Silicon (a-Si) devices undertaken under similar weather conditions in Nigeria. The DSSM’s good response to short wavelength radiation made it perform better at increased AM values than what has been reported of a-Si PV modules. Results Studies on a-Si showed that their performance favors low AM conditions. The DSSM generally performed better than what is reported of a-Si, based on irradiance and temperature dependence. Nonetheless, a-Si devices performed better at higher irradiance intensities.

According to the new directive on renewable energies of the European Commission (2009/28/EC), the European Union should reach a 20% share of the total energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. The national overall targets impose for Italy a 17% renewable share: in case of failure the gap would be filled by importation of renewable energy from non-UE countries. The ambitious national targets and thus the continuously increasing interest on renewable fuels, require simple but reliable methods for the energy potential assessment over large-scale territories. Considering roof-top integrated PV systems, the assessment of the PV energy potential passes through the evaluation of the roof surface area available for installations. In the present paper a methodology for estimating the PV solar energy potential is presented, together with its application to Piedmont Region (North-Western Italy).

The variation of albedo based on different foreground surfaces and under different atmospheric conditions is an area which is under research. This paper presents an experimental investigation of albedos of different foreground materials that can be used for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Overcast skies are predominant in northerly locations and will have a high frequency of low solar altitudes, and thus ground reflection is an important contributor towards total solar energy gain. The foreground surfaces include common materials: Grass, sand, and cement slabs, and some non-conventional materials: White pebbles, white boards, white tiles, and aluminium foil.

471,013-181-016-659-668,Modelling and simulation of Building-Integrated solar thermal systems: Behaviour of the coupled building/system configuration,2015,"Abstract In the building sector there is a new tendency to integrate solar thermal technologies into buildings. These systems are known as Building-Integrated Solar Thermal (BIST) and offer several advantages in comparison with the Building-Added (BA) installations. The present study is a critical review on modelling of BIST systems and also covers other types of BI solar configurations such as Photovoltaic (PV) and Photovoltaic/Thermal (PVT) in order to provide a better view of the literature. For some instances where the model and/or the system are interesting, BA systems are also cited. The studies are presented into groups, depending on the type of modelling (energetic, thermal, optical, etc.) and based on the technical characteristics of each system (solar collector, skin facade, etc.). The present article is the first part of an investigation about BIST modelling and it gives emphasis on the studies which focus on the interaction between BIST and building (coupled building/system configuration). The study reveals that majority of the modelling are about BIPV and skin facades while there are very few studies on BIST systems. Thereby, more investigations on energetic, thermal, optical simulations for BIST installations particularly for active systems (e.g. active solar thermal collectors) are necessary. On the other hand, innovative ideas such as systems with phase change materials, nanofluids, concentrating solar thermal could also be examined as a future prospect for modelling/simulation. The study also shows that further development of environmental models on BIST systems is required.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Emphasis (telecommunications); Thermal; Photovoltaic mounting system; Nanofluid; Electronic engineering; Active solar; Facade; Photovoltaic system; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2015.03.075,journal article,University of Lleida,es

The converter is built up as a cascade of two topologies, being an interleaved boost converter and a phase-shifted full bridge. The interleaved boost converter was chosen to lower the current stresses for the components and to reduce the required input and output capacitance due to the ripple current cancellation in the in- and output. The full bridge is chosen for its galvanic isolation and to perform the high step-up via the transformer turns ratio. It is shown that the maximum intermediate voltage level in between both converters can be derived from the continuous conduction mode of operation. Simulations are provided that show the correct operation of the overall structure.

474,014-031-842-403-587,An Image-Based Gamut Analysis of Translucent Digital Ceramic Prints for Coloured Photovoltaic Modules,2018,"Colouring the frontglass of photovoltaic (PV) modules via digital ceramic printing aids in concealing the PV modules when integrated into existing building facades as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), while admitting sufficient light to produce electricity. This promotes the visual acceptance and adoption of PV modules as a source of renewable energy in urban environments. The effective colour of the PV laminate is a combination of the transparent colour on glass and the colour of the PV cells. This colour should ideally match the architect’s visual expectations in terms of fidelity, but also in terms of relative PV efficiency as a function of print density. In practice, these requirements are often contradictory, particularly for vivid colours, and the visual results may deviate significantly. This paper presents an objective analysis of how colours appear on ceramically printed frontglass when laminated with a PV module, using an image-based colour acquisition process. Given a set of 1044 nominal colours uniformly distributed in the RGB colour space, each printed in 10 opacities, we quantify the range of effective colours observed when printed on glass and combined with a PV module, and their deviation from the nominals. Our results confirm that the effective colour gamuts are significantly constrained and skewed, depending on the ink volume and glass finish used for printing. In particular, blue–magenta hues cannot be reliably rendered with this process. These insights can serve as guidelines for selecting target colours for BIPV that can be well approximated in practice.",Inkwell; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Computer graphics (images); Hue; Gamut; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics; RGB color model; Process (computing),http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings8020030,journal article,Fraunhofer Society,de

The Kyoto Protocol requirements and the European Union (EU) directives to promote the use of renewable energy sources (RES) together with environmental policies introduced for the development and use of alternative energies have generated a large number of market opportunities for this sector. Differences in the application of energy policies have caused significant imbalances in electricity systems and distortion of electricity prices. The main concern of governments is to define the support schemes to be used and how to combine them in the most profitable manner. The aim of this paper is to provide a comparative cost-effectiveness assessment using feed-in tariffs (FiT) and net-metering (NM) schemes in some representative EU countries. The authors have developed an economic model to evaluate the profitability of PV projects combining these support schemes. Results show not only the circumstances under which solar energy is economically profitable, but also the kind of PV systems, locations, minimum levels of tariff prices and specific combination of support schemes that should be promoted.",Public economics; Feed-in tariff; Energy policy; Environmental economics; Economics; Renewable energy; Tariff; Net metering; European union; Photovoltaic system; Kyoto Protocol,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.040,journal article,University of Castilla–La Mancha,es

This study presents a novel approach to improve short-term hourly photovoltaic power output predictions using feature engineering and machine learning. Feature selection measured the importance score of input features by using a model-based variable importance. It verified that the normative sky index in the weather forecasted data had the least importance as a predictor for hourly prediction of photovoltaic power output. Six different machine-learning algorithms were assessed to select an appropriate model for the hourly power output prediction with onsite weather forecast data. The recurrent neural network outperformed five other models, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, classification and regression trees, chi-square automatic interaction detection, and random forests, in terms of its ability to predict photovoltaic power output at an hourly and daily resolution for 64 tested days. Feature engineering was then used to apply dropout observation to the normative sky index from the training and prediction process, which improved the hourly prediction performance. In particular, the prediction accuracy for overcast days improved by 20% compared to the original weather dataset used without dropout observation. The results show that feature engineering effectively improves the short-term predictions of photovoltaic power output in buildings with a simple weather forecasting service.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Data mining; Recurrent neural network; Random forest; Weather forecasting; Dropout (neural networks); Feature engineering; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Artificial neural network; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12173247,journal article,Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials,kr

Improved efficiency of such systems is achieved by the reduction of the Photovoltaic cell's temperature since the temperature of the cell is reversely proportional to its efficiency. The reduction of temperature can be achieved by placing a heat water or air recovering system, which may transport the heat inside the building for the indoor heating and/or water heating for domestic use. Furthermore, a simulation method of using the Photovoltaic/Thermal air system on the facade of a building complemented by conventional systems is developed, aiming at covering the needs for warm water usage as well as the indoor central heating and air-conditioning of a building.

By taking into account that storage is a key factor in the effective use of renewable energy, the present article is an overview about storage systems which are appropriate for BIPV and BIPVT applications. The literature review shows that there are multiple storage solutions, based on different kinds of materials (batteries, Phase Change Material (PCM) components, etc.). In terms of BIPV and BIPVT with batteries or PCMs or water tanks as storage systems, most of the installations are non-concentrating, facade- or roof-integrated, water- or air-based (in the case of BIPVT) and include silicon-based PV cells, lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries, paraffin- or salt-based PCMs. Regarding parameters that affect the environmental profile of storage systems, in the case of batteries critical factors such as material manufacturing, accidental release of electrolytes, inhalation toxicity, flammable elements, degradation and end-of-life management play a pivotal role. Regarding PCMs, there are some materials that are corrosive and present fire-safety issues as well as high toxicity in terms of human health and ecosystems. Concerning water storage tanks, based on certain studies about tanks with volumes of 300 L and 600 L, their impacts range from 5.9 to 11.7 GJprim and from 0.3 to 1.0 t CO2.eq. Finally, it should be noted that additional storage options such as Trombe walls, pebble beds and nanotechnologies are critically discussed.

In tropical climates, although rooftops are ideal for photovoltaic (PV) module integration, the available area may be insufficient to meet building energy demand due to the recent high-rise nature of urban buildings, causing a requirement for the utilisation of facades. However, the high angle of solar elevation means that facades are unfavourably oriented towards receiving incident solar irradiation. In addition, the issue exists of high solar heat gains into built spaces. This paper proposes a method to utilise horizontally inclined photovoltaic modules integrated on solar shading devices in order to combat these issues of unfavourable inclination and solar heat gains in commercial office buildings in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Various strategies are introduced and evaluated in terms of their inclination angles and the distance between installations. The results are analysed in terms of economic potential in order to determine which strategies are capable of producing the most electricity and reducing building cooling loads for the lowest installation costs.

This situation fosters the integration of these products in the BIPV and BIST systems within the heritage sites, especially thanks to the use of advanced customisation processes, special and low-reflecting glasses, and innovative cost-competitive coatings. There is a limited number of studies on the application of these technologies in heritage contexts, due to the presence of architectonic, conservative, and cultural barriers. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the available literature on the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in heritage sites and buildings, which would foster the preservation of their cultural and natural values as well as reducing primary energy consumption, increasing comfort levels, minimizing environmental impacts, and improving technical quality and economical outlays. A common framework will thus defined to support restorers, historic conservators, and energy experts and to facilitate the diffusion and application of RES in heritage contexts. This conceptual framework will provide industries and academics with operative strategies and will encourage their diffusion and application in sensible contexts.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architecture; Conceptual framework; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Building envelope; Dynamism; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/949/1/012113,journal article,"EURAC RESEARCH, INSTITUTE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY, Via A.Volta 13/A, 39100 Bolzano, IT",it

However, data on this issue are conflicting, and recent studies suggest that fluid dynamic abnormalities exist in these patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether early stages of atherosclerosis are characterized by alterations of baseline coronary hemodynamics and endothelium-independent vasomotion. Besides established intracoronary Doppler parameters, heterogeneity of perfusion was assessed and related to early signs of atherosclerosis as determined by electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). Methods In 59 patients with typical angina and angiographically normal or near-normal coronary arteries, intracoronary Doppler measurements were performed in all 3 major coronary arteries. Baseline average peak velocity (bAPV) and hyperemic average peak velocity (hAPV) in response to intracoronary injection of adenosine were measured, and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed as variability of bAPV, hAPV, and CFVR and was calculated as (STD/MEAN) · 100. Doppler data were analyzed according to tertiles of the EBCT-derived Agatston calcium score (ie, score 0-1 [lowest tertile], 2-28 [medium tertile], and >28 [highest tertile]). Results The mean EBCT-derived Agatston calcium score was 49 ± 107. No coronary calcium was observed in 17 (29%) patients. The mean values of bAPV, hAPV, and CFVR were not different between the calcium score tertiles. However, patients in the highest tertile had a significantly increased variability index of bAPV (29.6% ± 11.6%) compared with patients in the lowest tertile (13.4% ± 7.3%, P P =.03). Conclusion These results indicate that early stages of atherosclerosis are characterized by microvascular abnormalities that do not uniformly affect the myocardium but are heterogeneous. The high variability of baseline coronary flow velocity with increasing coronary calcium suggests that in patients with early stages of atherosclerosis fluid dynamic effects may play a crucial role even in the absence of angiographically appreciable epicardial stenoses.

The anticipated boom has so far stalled and despite developing and promoting a number of excellent systems and products, many producers around the world have been forced to quit on purely economic grounds. The authors believe that after this painful cleansing of the market, a massive counter trend will follow, enlivened and carried forward by more advanced PV technologies and ever- stricter climate policies designed to achieve energy neutrality in a cost-effective way. As a result, the need for BIPV products for use in construction will undergo first a gradual and then a massive increase. The planning of buildings with multifunctional, integrated roof and facade elements capable of fulfilling the technical and legal demands will become an essential, accepted part of the architectonic mainstream and will also contribute to an aesthetic valorisation. Until then, various barriers need to be overcome in order to facilitate and accelerate BIPV. Besides issues related to mere cost-efficiency ratio, psychological and social factors also play an evident role.

498,021-821-138-709-021,Voltage Control at Building Integrated Photovoltaic and Wind Turbine System with PI-PD Controller,2020,"With the gradual decline in fossil fuels, the area of interest for electric power generation has shifted to wind turbines and other sources of DC electricity such as PV (photovoltaic). Since the voltage output values of these sources vary over a wide range, DC/AC inverters should be used which give an increased constant output voltage and well controlled output voltage. In residential buildings that meet the energy need from non-continuous renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines, it is very important to ensure constant quality power flow to the building, especially when energy demand varies sharply. In this study, it is aimed to control the voltage consumed in the houses by controlling the three phase PWM (pulses width modulation) voltage source inverter system (VSI) with PI-PD controller in the integrated smart building system of renewable energy sources (solar panel and wind turbine). First the building integrated solar and wind systems (BIPv/Wt-Building Integrated PV Panel and Wind Turbine) design, then the controller design and the simulation of the system have been made at this research. After obtaining the transfer function of the BIPv/Wt system, the parameters of the PI-PD controller were calculated using the frequency response analysis method. In the BIPv/Wt system, we used PI-PD, integer order PI and fractional order PI control structures to control the closed voltage control loop in the DC/AC inverter system used to control the voltage used in the building. In order to compare the voltages of the control structures on the voltage used in the building, we installed our system on the Matlab / Simulink platform and performed simulations for two test scenarios. Depending on the phase voltages plotting the simulation results and the harmonic values measured, it is seen that using PI-PD control has more positive results for the systems showing the energy demand for the day such as building systems.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Three-phase; Renewable energy; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Wind power; Control theory; Pulse-width modulation,http://dx.doi.org/10.31590/ejosat.668427,journal article,"Elektrik ve Elektronik Mühendisliği Bölümü, Bingöl Üniversitesi, Türkiye",tr

To maximize the benefits of employing BIPV, it is important to integrate them properly into the grid of the building. The discussion on AC versus DC distribution for microgrid and nanogrid backbones is currently revisited as the level of penetration of renewable sources, electric vehicles and DC loads is constantly increasing. This paper tackles this question and provides guidelines using a validated simulation framework. The study compares DC (48 V and 380 V) and AC (230 V/50 Hz) topologies integrated into a ten-story office building with facade-integrated BIPV. Annual simulations are carried out for five locations with different climatic conditions and comparisons are made in terms of system- and component-level efficiency, system losses, self-sufficiency, self-consumption and CO2 emission. The analysis shows that the DC topologies perform better than the AC one, especially for the locations with high solar energy yield compared to the cooling and heating loads. Further, a parametric analysis is performed to determine the optimal sizing of the building grid components, DC and AC alike.

502,022-467-353-727-959,Design and analysis of a BIPV/T system with two applications controlled by an air handling unit,2018,"Abstract A building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) system was designed and analyzed. The BIPV/T system is composed of multiple PV/T air collectors integrated into the building facade and connected to an air handling unit (AHU) to control the air flow. The system operates with two applications, an application for cold weather and an other for hot weather. In cold weather, the BIPV/T system recovers heat from the PV modules to preheat the outdoor fresh air. While in hot weather, the cool air exhausted from the conditioned spaces of the building is used to decrease the PV cells temperature, instead of ambient air as in conventional PV/T air collectors. An experimental tests were conducted to see the effect of using the cool exhaust air as coolant for the PV cells instead of ambient air. In order to predict thermal and electrical performance of each PV/T air collector under real climatic conditions, a theoretical model of a single pass PV/T air collector was developed and validated against experimental observations from previous literature. The theoretical and experimental comparison between the case of using exhaust air as coolant and the case of using ambient air as coolant showed an important decrease in PV cells temperature. The maximum decrease value in PV cells temperature obtained from the simulation is 9.46 ° C in a selected day from August, while the electrical simulation showed that the average increase value in electrical efficiency in a selected day from August is 0.350. The simulation of the BIPV/T system in cold weather indicated that the average rate of saved useful thermal energy when using preheated outdoor fresh air in a selected day from February is 24.20%. Furthermore, the PV/T air collector performances were compared for the optimal tilt angle and the complete vertical position. The results revealed that installing the PV/T air collector at optimal tilt angle showed much better performances than a one installed at a complete vertical position, especially the electrical performance in Summer.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Airflow; Nuclear engineering; Electrical efficiency; Thermal; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Vertical direction; Coolant,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.08.090,journal article,University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene,dz

However, SDHS technical barriers during their design and operation phases, combined with their economic limitation, promote a high variation in quantifying SDHS benefits over their lifetime. This study proposes a complete multi-objective optimization framework using a robust machine learning approach to inherent sustainability principles in the design of SDHS. Moreover, the framework investigates the uncertainty in the context of SDHS design, in which the Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is combined with the heuristics optimization approach. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for the optimal integration of SHDS at different urban community sizes (10, 25, 50, and 100 buildings) located in Madrid. The results reveal a substantial improvement in economic and environmental benefits for deploying SDHS, especially with including the seasonal storage tank (SST) construction properties in the optimization problem, and it can achieve a payback period up to 13.7 years. In addition, the solar fraction of the optimized SDHS never falls below 82.1% for the investigated community sizes with an efficiency above 69.5% for the SST. Finally, the GSA indicates the SST investment cost and its relevant construction materials, are primarily responsible for the variability in the optimal system feasibility. The proposed framework can provide a good starting point to solve the enormous computational expenses drawbacks associated with the heuristics optimization approach. Furthermore, it can function as a decision support tool to fulfill the European Union energy targets regarding clean energy production.",Decision support system; Machine learning; Heuristics; Optimization problem; Payback period; Artificial intelligence; Life-cycle assessment; Context (language use); European union; Computer science; Multi-objective optimization,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114903,journal article,"Departament d’Enginyeria Mecànica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Av.

The integration of PV into building components, such as facade, window, roof or shading elements, leads to a distributed generation over the building envelope with a profound impact on the electrical installation. Designing the electrical system with string inverters and a possible wide variety of module sizes and technologies is a challenging task. To overcome this issue, Module-Level Converters (MLCs) can be used. A supplementary benefit is that the consequences of partial shading can strongly be reduced. This paper investigates whether the current generation of MLCs is suited for embedment in facade BIPV modules. The PV output is categorized and compared to the input parameters of the converters. Besides the discrepancy between the physical dimensions of the converters and the desired installation location, thermal and electrical measurements on a prototype BIPV curtain wall element reveal that daily energy losses can be as high as 50% due to thermal overload when used in a moderate climate such as Belgium.

The present study is an advancement towards the life cycle assessment (LCA) of a linear dielectric-based building-integrated concentrating PV system by means of multiple life-cycle impact assessment methods and environmental indicators (ReCiPe, Eco-indicator 99, ecological footprint, USEtox, ReCiPe-based and Eco-indicator-99-based payback times (PBTs), etc.), providing a detailed analysis. Two configurations (with and without reflective film) are examined, for different cities (Barcelona, Exeter and Dublin). By focussing on material manufacturing (system with reflective film), in general, ReCiPe (endpoint/single-score; points) results are in accordance to Eco-indicator 99 (single-score; points) findings and based on both methods PVs have the maximum contribution for ecosystems/ecosystem quality and human health. Moreover, based on USEtox results, there is a remarkable difference between the impact of the PVs and the impact of the other components. With regard to the PBTs, taking into account both configurations with/without reflective film, Barcelona presents the lowest ReCiPe and Eco-indicator-99 PBTs ranging from 3.6 to 5.8 years. On the other hand, Exeter and Dublin show PBTs from 3.7 to 7.8 years. According to ReCiPe/endpoint results with characterization, for climate change/human health (system with reflective film) Barcelona shows 1.2 × 10 −7 disability-adjusted-life-years per kWh while Dublin and Exeter present a footprint of present about 1.8 × 10 −7 disability-adjusted-life-years per kWh. Results in terms of (species.yr)/kWh are also presented (ReCiPe/endpoint with characterization), for several scenarios. Regarding the two configurations, the findings based on multiple approaches verify that reflective film considerably improves the eco-profile of the reference system (configuration without reflective film). For example, by utilizing reflective film there is a reduction of ReCiPe-based and Eco-indicator-99-based PBTs ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 years, depending on the scenario. Finally, results from the literature are presented along with results of the present study and a critical discussion is provided.

The value of building integration for the introduction of grid connected PV is recognized around the world. Rooftop programs, aiming at large-scale application in the next century are carried out in many countries. In order to reach this widespread application, however, cost reductions still are essential.

Solar energy is one of the comparable candidates. Solar energy is widely available and it is free of cost. Solar energy can be converted into direct current electricity by PV effect. We are also trying on the practical usage of static electricity. In this paper, we study about the utilization of solar energy and building solar wall system. A significant amount of research and development work on the photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) technology has been carried out in developed nations, but that was not the case in India. Building integrated photovoltaic system (BIPV) can be considered as economical system by taking advantage of PV technology and providing benefits in addition to energy production like weatherproofing, insulation, and even structural strength to the building.

For a large-scale PV array installed on the facades of a super high-rise building, the environmental conditions (e.g., the irradiance, temperature, sunlight angle etc.) are always complex and dynamic. As a result, the PV configuration and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methodology are of great importance for both the operational safety and efficiency. In this study, some famous PV configurations are comprehensively tested under complex shading conditions in BIPV application, and a robust configuration for large-scale BIPV system based on the total-cross-tied (TCT) circuit connection is developed. Then, by analyzing and extracting the feature variables of environment parameters, a novel fast MPPT methodology based on extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. Finally, the proposed configuration and its MPPT methodology are verified by simulation experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed configuration performs efficient on most of the complex shading conditions, and the ELM-based intelligent MPPT methodology can also obtain promising performance on response speed and tracking accuracy.</jats:p>",Control engineering; Control (management); Extreme learning machine; Maximum power point tracking; Computer science; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jifs-210424,journal article,"School of Artificial Intelligence, Wuchang University of Technology, Wuhan, China",cn

BIPV product development has been ongoing for the past 30 years, but their practical applications have been limited in China. Clients and end users lack knowledge of cost analysis, to make more accurate decisions on use of PV products. BIPV cost-benefit analysis should include not only initial costs but also ongoing maintenance and repair costs throughout the building life. Moreover, the scope and factors of cost-benefit analysis should be extended to include the community and environment aspects. In a cost-benefit analysis, various risk and opportunity factors such as electricity price, and government support should be considered. However, up until now, there have been limited studies that analyzed cost-benefit factors of BIPV from a supply chain perspective. Most previous studies focused on the Building Attached PV projects. This research aims to gain an in-depth understanding on the costs - benefits of BIPV. A real-life BIPV case drawn from China was studied by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method.

In regions in which there is a shortage of free land and no fossil fuel reserves, building-integrated photovoltaics with an additional attribute of semitransparency (BISTPV) can help to realize sustainable economic growth. The net electricity savings in dwellings and commercial edifices can be substantially enhanced by using BISTPV shrewdly. In addition to building applications, semitransparent (ST) solar cells can be used in yacht hatches, signboards on express-ways, automobiles, electronic displays, and other applications. It is anticipated that in the foreseeable future, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells, and chalcopyrite solar cells based BISTPV modules will replace aesthetically repulsive c-Si-based ST modules, which are currently the key player in the BIPV market. DSSCs are superior to a-Si:H and chalcopyrite-based PV in terms of the appropriate choice of dyes, for which wavelengths that have a low eye sensitivity factor can be selectively harnessed. The transparency, or ability to see-through, can be further increased by making use of highly transparent photoanodes and counter electrodes. However, the stability issues that are associated with DSSCs have halted their propagation to the BIPV market. In contrast, ST a-Si:H solar cells have been well developed on a laboratory scale, and ST panels made by various companies are available on the market. Apart from ST DSSCs and a-Si:H solar cells, which have evolved considerably, chalcopyrite STPV has only recently started the journey of its development on a laboratory scale although it has a large potential for BISTPV. Therefore, considerable efforts must be made for it to emerge in the BIPV market. This article will present a detailed review of the material requirements for fabricating ST dye-sensitized-, amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)-, and chalcopyrite-based solar cells, especially for BIPV applications.

The modules are stored in 85 °C. The power conversion efficiency of the modules drops rapidly in 100 h during the test. To analyze and enhance the module design in view of reliability, finite element model is developed for the module. Stress analysis reveals that high stresses in electrode cause the breakage of electrode and sealant in succession and the loss of electrolyte finally. From a parameter sensitivity analysis with the finite element model, it is identified that the maximum stress in electrode can decrease when the cell width increases. CTEs of sealant and electrolyte can be also optimized as analysis confirms that the maximum stress in electrode drops when the CTEs of sealant and electrolyte decrease. Based on the studies, new module design is formulated, which have the cell width of 18 mm and the CTEs of 277 and 656 ppm/°C for sealant and electrolyte, respectively.

In highly glazed buildings, transparent elements are more often being equipped with PV cells placed between two sheets of glass. Moreover, brand new technologies focus currently on homogenous, transparent glass with different transparency. The main aim of the presented study was to analyse transparent PV (TPV) integrated with office windows. The following 10%, 20% or 30% of transparency degree were considered, depending on the required illuminance inside the room. The optical properties were obtained on the basis of literature review and manufactured data. Different types of TPV were defined for the purpose of building energy performance analysis.

The properties of TPV glass layer were estimated considering thermo- electrical solar energy conversion, taking into account the sun beam angle and temperature of thepanel. The model of single office room with TPV windowpane was analysed numerically. Results obtained for different TPV panels were compared with traditional clear float double glazing.

Therefore, there is a need to evaluate BIPVT environmental profile, for instance by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In light of the issues mentioned above, the present article is an LCA study that assesses the environmental performance of a BIPVT prototype that has been developed and patented at the Ulster University (Belfast, UK). The investigation places emphasis on material manufacturing, based on Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), Global Warming Potential (GWP), ReCiPe, Ecological footprint and USEtox.

532,030-466-271-111-611,Temperature Dependent Power Modeling of Photovoltaics,2014,"Abstract Photovoltaic (PV) systems in the USA are often perceived as useful only in warm and sunny climate regions. However, PV systems can be installed and operated in cold regions as well, including places that get snow. Sunlight is the source of electricity, and thermal heat is not required to generate electricity in PV systems. Given similar irradiation conditions, lower PV-cell temperatures can lead to increases in efficiency, which leads to an increase in power generation, thus allowing the user to benefit more from the PV technology. This study focuses on the relationship between the level of energy production and varying temperatures. Two models have been developed to show temperature effect on photovoltaic systems, using transient systems simulation (TRNSYS), a FORTRAN-based modular program to assess solar conversion and heat transfer. The first model (Model A) ignores temperature and the other (Model B) takes it into consideration. In Model A, the efficiency was assumed to be constant through the year. In Model B, the temperature and the resulting efficiency change of the PV cells are defined according to deviations from the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT), using equations from the literature. These two models were executed for 236 cities across the USA by using second-generation Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data. These two models calculate discrete outputs of power density, given irradiance and temperature conditions. Comparative analyses were made between these two models. The power output differences for 236 cities across the USA were used to generate contour maps indicating a continuous surface of differences between these two models. Comparing Model B relative to Model A power outputs increase during the months of November to February for the Northeast and the Midwest regions of the USA (16% -20%), whereas they decrease slightly in May to August (-4%). On the other hand, power outputs decrease considerably from May to August for the South and Southwest of the USA (-12% - 15%), whereas they increase slightly from December to February (5%).

The three types of uncovered PVT collectors in this paper can be distinguished as an un-insulated add-on PVT collector, a PVT collector with insulation at the back and a building integrated PVT collector. In this paper, we will describe the experimental outdoor field test facility used for measuring the electrical and thermal performance. Furthermore, the results of the steady state analysis and typical collector curves are presented. In the next phase of the project, results of this field test will be used for dynamic simulations of the annual electrical and thermal energy yields for typical system designs and heat loads in the Netherlands.",Thermal energy; Engineering; Power (physics); Thermal; Electrical performance; Test setup; Test facility; Field (computer science); Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2016.06.166,journal article,"Solar Energy Application Centre (SEAC), High Tech Campus 21, 5656AE Eindhoven, the Netherlands",nl
536,032-041-096-096-264,Understanding the behaviour of naturally-ventilated BIPV modules : A sensitivity analysis,2020,"Abstract Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is a key concept for the realisation of sustainable buildings. Despite the progress in BIPV modelling, the use of sensitivity analysis (SA) is still scarce in the BIPV literature. SA can help the modeller to identify which model inputs influence the model outputs the most. This paper presents a simulation framework that combines global SA methods with a multi-physics BIPV model. The analysis focuses on the performance of naturally ventilated BIPV facade elements (cell temperature and power). Building performance indicators, such as the total heat flux to the building interior and the building wall temperature, are also analysed. Inputs to the SA include convective heat transfer coefficients, cavity airflow rate, and weather conditions. As expected, the SA results were found to be highly dependent on the range selected for the inputs. For a narrow variation in weather conditions, the exterior convective heat transfer coefficient was identified as the input with the strongest influence on the BIPV performance. Results also showed that cavity ventilation becomes more important as the exterior convective heat transfer decreases. These findings indicate the need for accurate models to represent exterior convective heat transfer in BIPV facades and corroborate the importance of cavity ventilation.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Airflow; Heat flux; Natural ventilation; Facade; Heat transfer coefficient; Environmental science; Convective heat transfer; Photovoltaic system; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.06.086,journal article,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,be

The work is part of a national project that aims at developing robust BIPV-solutions suitable for a Norwegian climate. The project also aims at identifying the main building-technical and architectural integration challenges for BIPV. A questionnaire has been developed to interview key personnel involved in the design, installation and operational phases, and a database is under development to build a wider knowledge base for the expected performances of different system types and geographical locations. Performance is evaluated in terms of energy production, specific yield, and performance ratio (PR) in cases where irradiation data is available. Data collected so far indicate a relatively large spread in annual specific yield with typical values in the 700–900 kWh/kWp range.

BIPVT system, consisting of flat-plate PVT solar collectors, is integrated in the south facing facade of a non-residential high-rise building. BIPVT collectors produce: i) thermal energy for space heating purposes, by a radiant floor system; ii) Domestic Hot Water (DHW); iii) electricity. Electric air-to-water heat pumps/chillers and a condensing gas fired boiler are used as auxiliary systems for space heating/cooling and DHW, respectively. In addition, the system also includes an electricity storage system coupled to the BIPVTs in order to mitigate the effects of solar energy intermittency and to obtain a virtually grid-independent system. In order to compare the proposed BIPVT system to a conventional building, a reference building model, i.e. without BIPVTs, energy storage and radiant floor, is considered. Here, the space heating and cooling energy is supplied by air-to-water heat pumps (one for each floor), DHW is produced by a condensing boiler and electricity is supplied by the national grid. The comparison is performed for three thermal zones, well representative of the thermal behaviour of the whole building. In this paper, a detailed dynamic simulation model is developed by means of well-known tool TRNSYS 17, in order to predict the transient behaviour of BIPVT system. Energy and exergy balances are taken into account to determine, for the 1-year operation, the exergy destructions and exergetic efficiencies of each of the investigated components. The economic viability of the proposed system is also discussed and the resulted Simple Pay Back period is about 4 years. From the carried out exergy analysis, the average exergetic efficiency of electricity storage system is about 90%, whereas the condensing boiler one is close to 2% all year long. In addition, an exergy analysis on the proposed BIPVT system located in several European weather zones is also carried out, as well as a suitable exergy analysis is performed by varying the capacity of the electricity storage system. Such analyses aim to assess the weather condition and the size of electricity storage effects on the destroyed exergy and exergetic efficiency of BIPVT collectors and electricity storage, respectively. It resulted that, the highest destroyed exergy of BIPVT occurs in Larnaca (150 MWh/year) vs the lowest one in Belfast (87 MWh/year), whereas the BIPVT collectors exergetic efficiencies range from 8.4% for Larnaca to 8.8% for Belfast.",Thermal energy; Exergy; Condensing boiler; TRNSYS; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Chiller; Solar energy; Energy storage; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.11.060,journal article,University of Naples Federico II,it

544,034-336-761-903-734,Thermal performance of PV modules as building elements: Analysis under real operating conditions of different technologies.,2020,"Abstract Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) represents a strategic part of the future building vision with a huge potential driven by the growing shift towards renewable energy resources. However, transforming building surfaces into active electricity generators must consider the thermal behaviour of photovoltaic (PV) panels since it affects both the power conversion efficiency of the PV modules and the thermal comfort of the building. Although several methods have been developed for the evaluation of the thermal performance of the PV modules, at present, no clear consensus exist on which model fits better for this application considering different PV technologies and real operating conditions. This work presents the study of the thermal behaviour of four different PV technologies (polycrystalline silicon, cadmium telluride, amorphous silicon; and organic PV) based on measurements collected by an experimental system located in Murcia (southeast of Spain) during a full year. Two prediction models to estimate the operating cell temperatures of PV modules (NOCT and Sandia) have been evaluated for their suitability in BIPV systems. The results show how both models strongly depend on the incident solar irradiance magnitude and orientation. Furthermore, the correlation between ambient and module temperature difference and the in-plane irradiance shows a thermal hysteresis effect that is mostly independent of the technology but strongly dependent on orientation, with special impact for east and west faces. The results should be taken into consideration for more accurate estimations of electricity production of BIPV systems.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal comfort; Automotive engineering; Renewable energy; Electricity; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Cadmium telluride photovoltaics; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110087,journal article,University of Cartagena,co

In this paper, a simulation has been performed for Economic Weaker Section (EWS) housing schemes to see the impact of roof attached PV modules on room operative temperature (Topt) and compare it with the base case roof without PV modules. A Non-conditioned building is simulated for the composite climate of Indore in the DesignBuilder software. For thermal comfort analysis, a simulation for the summer months has been performed (April-September). It has been observed that compared to No PV Roof 1 (RCC) as a base case, the maximum reduction in room operative temperature of PV Roof 1 (RCC) case is 3 °C and 3.7 °C for PV Roof 2 (stone). Due to the reduction in Topt, the simple payback period (SPP) calculated for PV Roof 1 (RCC) is 5.77 yrs and for PV Roof 2 (Stone) it is 4.32 yrs. The Net CO2 emission gets reduced by 30% and 50%, respectively, for BAPV Roof 1 and Roof 2 compared to the base case. The BAPV cases achieve the Net CO2 mitigation of 109 tonnes and 113 tonnes.

BIPV can be used today in different ways on both existing and new buildings. Architects and designers are discovering BIPV. With the help of custom-made products available on the German market they are beginning to explore the technical limits of an aesthetic and structural integration of PV in buildings. As a result some exciting high-profile building projects with PV have been built, for example, the small service pavilion Meereslauschen in Steinhude or the new headquarters building of the Wood Trade Association in Munich. These projects show that the use of PV is very varied and offers opportunities for creative architects. However non-technical problems still need to be solved to allow a meaningful and widespread application of PV in the built environment. To decrease costs it is essential to develop further standard BIPV components. The aim of such developments should be to replace standard PV modules by products in which PV and structural building elements are melded into one design and structural unit.

In recent years, one of the popular solar technologies is building integrated photovoltaic-thermal collectors, because of profitability and no need for separate architectural space. In this study, a new combination of glazed building integrated photovoltaic thermal solar collectors and an absorption cooling system, as a trigeneration system, to provide thermal and electrical energy demands of a case study residential building, is proposed. Dynamic simulation of the proposed system is performed using the TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulator. Because there is no model for the glazed photovoltaic thermal solar collectors in TRNSYS, the thermal model of the glazed building integrated photovoltaic thermal solar collectors is developed in MATLAB and connected to the TRNSYS model. Taking into account the passive and active effects of the BIPVT system, as well as the allocation of thermal energy generation by the BIPVT system so that the absorption chiller is a priority, the cooling energy demand of the building is reduced by 36%. The result showed that the proposed system provides 29% (55.81 Mwh/year) of the annual building energy demand, i.e. 34% of the electrical energy demand and 22% of the thermal energy demands of the building. The annual solar fraction and the total efficiency of the trigeneration system are 28% and 18%, respectively.

L’objectif de cette video etait de presenter une technique de cure de FVV du col vesical par voie vaginale en position du jockey (procubitus). Methodes Nous presentons le cas d’une patiente de 67 ans, suivie pour une vessie neurologique avec trouble de la compliance et insuffisance sphincterienne apres hematome du cone medullaire. Suite a la pose d’une bandelette aponevrotique pubovaginale (BAPV) occasionnant des auto-sondages traumatiques, une fistule vesico-vaginale est apparue avec un orifice fistuleux de 2 cm de diametre au niveau du col vesical. Une cure de la fistule vesico-vaginale avec interposition d’un lambeau de Martius a ete realise par voie vaginale en position du Jockey en raison de la position tres distale de la fistule (qui a fait preferer la voie vaginale) et d’un col vesical plaque a la paroi vaginale anterieur en raison de la BAPV (qui a fait preferer la position du Jockey pour permettre une meilleure vision).

In the mathematical model, the periodic nature of insolation, ambient air temperature, BIPV cell temperature, intermittent slab temperature, and room temperature have been considered while solving energy equilibrium differential equations. The insolation values used in the model are computed by using periodic HDKR (Hay, Davies, Klucher and Reindl) model, which is based on anisotropic sky concept. The influencing parameters i.e., air changes in both rooms of the two-storied BIPV thermal system, packing factor of the BIPV panel and the thickness of slab between rooms are considered for finding the thermal performance. It is observed that the most critical day of the year i.e., on 15th May, the upper storey and lower storey of the proposed BIPV system attains the highest room temperature of 47.3 °C and 42.6 °C, respectively. The air changes in the rooms reduce the above peak temperature for making it more comfortable.

New system architectures have been proposed to optimize performance. The common approach of these new architectures is to track the maximum power point of every solar module individually.

Three independent PV systems were installed and extensively monitored in Eindhoven, a reference string inverter system, a power optimizer system and a micro inverter system. The DC and AC performance ratio (PR) of the systems have been analyzed for different weather types based on the clearness index. A pole shading covering 1–2% of the total system surface has been used to evaluate system performance under a specific type of partial shading.

When metal foils are used as substrate, it is essential to deposit a dielectric barrier layer to isolate electrically and chemically the thin-film solar cells from the substrate. In this work, SiO x stacks deposited on ‘rough’ stainless steel by a combination of a new sol-gel formulation and a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) deposition step are reported as a suitable dielectric barrier layer candidate. Using these SiO x multilayers, a smooth and homogeneous film was achieved. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that back contact of the solar cell (based on Molybdenum) is not affected by the presence of the barrier layer. Moreover, according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements, this approach led to excellent barrier layer properties against the diffusion of impurities from the stainless steel.

The key to the elaboration process consists in the co-electrodeposition of Cu-In-Ga mixed oxides on submillimetric hole-patterned molybdenum substrate, followed by thermal reduction to metallic alloys and selenisation. This method has the advantage of being a selective deposition technique where the thin film growth is carried out only on Mo covered areas. Thus, after annealing, the transparency of the sample is always preserved, allowing light to pass through the device. A complete device (5 × 5 cm2 ) with 535 μm diameter holes and total glass aperture of around 35% shows an open circuit voltage (VOC ) of 400 mV.

This paper deals with reducing method of mismatching losses due to the non-uniform irradiance conditions. It is well-known that a certain number of multiple peaks occur on the power–voltage curve as the number of PV modules in one-string increases under non-uniform operating conditions. Since the conventional control method only drives the operating points of PV system to the local maxima close to open circuit voltage, only small portion of power can be extracted from the PV system. In this study, a radial basis function neural network (RBF-ANN) based intelligent control method is utilized to map the global operating voltage and non-irradiance operating condition in string and central based MPPT systems. The proposed method has been tested on 10 × 3 (2.2 kW), 15 × 3 (2.5 kW) and 20 × 3 (3.3 kW) of series–parallel PV array configuration under random-shaded and continuous-shaded patterns. The proposed method is compared with the ideal case and conventional method through a simple power–voltage curve of PV arrays. The simulation results show that there are significant increases of about 30–60% of the extracted power in one operating condition when the proposed method is able to shift the operating voltage of modules to their optimum voltages.",Engineering; Voltage; Maxima and minima; Electronic engineering; Performance enhancement; Maximum power point tracking; Photovoltaic system; Irradiance; Open-circuit voltage; Control theory; Intelligent control,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2012.03.028,journal article,"Department of Electrical Engineering of Universitas Hasanuddin, 90245 Tamalanrea-Makassar, Indonesia",id

Today, photovoltaic modules for building integration are produced as a standard building product, fitting into standard facade and roof structures these elements created a whole new market: BIPV. Since then building integration is one of the fastest growing market segments in photovoltaics.

Based on a conducted web-survey and qualitative interviews among local professionals, this paper examines the obstacles, potentials and drivers that could facilitate and accelerate BIPV and PV facade integration, as well as needs that could encourage wider PV use. In order to define a unified strategy, aligning the stakeholders’ views, the following disputable factors are pointed out and discussed: (1) incomplete understanding of BIPV and building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV) among stakeholders, (2) costs of BIPV systems, (3) low awareness of and confidence in “integrability” of PV modules, (4) incomplete knowledge about and insufficiently investigated PV performance and (5) potential of PV facade and roof integration. Since the costs are the key identified factor for BIPV implementation, life-cycle cost (LCC) assessments of PV facade and roof integrations have been performed, which supported the search for solutions to identified problems. The performed analysis and findings present the basis for the development of a long-term holistic strategy for PV implementation in Singapore that could help the highly-urbanized, tropical resource- and land-constrained island city-state reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and achieve the climate change targets, thus promoting a more sustainable built environment.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Business; Built environment; Facade; Photovoltaic system; Resource (project management); Sustainability; Nameplate capacity; Real estate,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13052630,journal article,"Hong Kong Polytech.

The system consists in Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic/Thermal (BIPVT) collectors, a water-to-water reversible heat pump and an adsorption chiller. The solar system will ensure space heating in winter, space cooling in summer and domestic hot water and electricity all over the year for a multi-storey building located in Algiers (Algeria). In the case of insufficient solar energy, the system is equipped with a gas-fired heater for auxiliary heat production, whereas the auxiliary electricity is supplied by the national grid. First, the simulation models of the solar system components and the building were described and developed in TRNSYS environment. Then, an energy-economic model based on the calculation of the primary energy consumption, the primary energy saving, the simple payback period and the electrical and thermal solar fractions, was carried-out. Finally, the system performance in terms of daily, monthly and yearly results was investigated and compared to the performance of a conventional energy system commonly used in Algerian buildings. The simulation results indicate that the solar collectors have the potential to cover more than 56% and 72% of the yearly heat and electricity requirements, respectively. The total primary energy saving achieved by the solar system with respect to the conventional one is 37.1 MWh/y, which represents 39% of the energy consumption of the conventional system. However, the economic feasibility of proposed solar system is difficult to be achieved due to the high initial cost of the solar collectors. Indeed, the obtained simple payback period is 55.40 years. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis has been performed aiming at studying the effect of various technical and economical parameters on the system performance. The analysis shows that the energetic as well as economic performances of the system are strongly influenced by the photovoltaic/thermal filed area, the system cost and the unitary cost of electricity. The system becomes economically profitable when the system cost is 400 €/m² and the electricity cost is 0.12 €/kWh.

Conventional LSCs doped with organic dyes suffered from high reabsorption losses with no transparency; whereas, recently reported heavy metal-doped quantum dots avoided such losses but possessed the risk of high toxicity and low ambient stability. Thus, luminophores with massive spectral shifts and cordial relationships with the environment are very much desirable. In this paper, we report the fabrication of PMMA based transparent LSC embedded with nanocrystals of environmental friendiness and multispectral harvesting gadolinium oxysulphide (Gd2O2S:Er,Yb) fluorophore. The Gd2O2S:Er,Yb nanofluorophore absorbs various excitation wavelengths ranging from UV to NIR and emits in the visible region offering huge Stoke's and anti-Stoke's shift concurrently. The non-existent reabsorption losses and overlapping maxima of Gd2O2S:Er,Yb nanofluorophore generated photon flux with solar cells' responsivity enhance the efficiency characteristics of the LSC waveguide. Performance analysis of LSC as a function of varying nanofluorophore dispersion ratio and changing edge width optimizes the fabrication process and exhibits high power conversion efficiency of ∼6.93% and optical efficiency of ∼8.57%. The LSC slab demonstrates high photostability under irradiation for prolonged hours without any dip in the emission characteristics.

It has influence on human health and comfort, as well as the quality of certain services and processes. Therefore, it plays an important role for many industries, storage systems, transport and the preservation of products.

The desiccant wheel is in charge of reducing the moisture caused by the process air and requires a hot spot for regeneration. This hot spot can be supported by solar thermal energy. This study evaluates the thermal potential of the ventilation and cooling system in a PV modules' installation. It is done according to the exploitation of the thermal energy transferred to the refrigerant as support to the hot spot, contributing to the regeneration of the desiccant wheel. For this to happen, an experimental installation has been developed, which consists of two inclined PV modules, with an air-flow channel below them. This system enables PV cells to refrigerate, thus improving the electric performance as well as making use of the residual heat generated from this process. One of the two modules is disposed of a series of plates interspersed in its cooling channel, with the aim of modifying the air flow, rising its residence time below the module and making the increase in air temperature more significant.

Energy demands also keep on rising and buildings alone contribute about 40% of energy use in the world. This means that even if the world shifts completely to cleaner energy options, buildings will still demand more energy and therefore sustainable energy sources for buildings should be encouraged. Again, the initial setup cost of fossil fuel energy is lower than renewable energy. To make renewable energy attractive, cheaper setup cost should be achieved and this can be done by a cost offset through building element replacement by PV. This means the use of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) is of high potential for financial offset than Building Applied Photovoltaic (BAPV). Quantitative data was gathered on roofing sheets cost and solar integration into roof cost. The average cost of roofing sheets for an area of 24m 2 roof spaces is $2,160.00 and the cost of integrating a solar PV on that same space is $9,600.00. The cost of constructing the space with roofing sheets is used to offset the cost of installing the solar PV to reduce it to $7,440.00.

In the modules, two glasses with electrodes and dye are sealed together to prevent the leakage of liquid electrolyte.

Previous studies showed that expansion of liquid electrolyte in the module is the main reason for the degradation; the expansion of electrolyte induces the breakage of sealant material of DSC module in high temperature. This study investigates how the sealant curing process affects the integrity of DSC module in high temperature. Sealant samples are made up by several UV curing times.

Part 1: State-of-the-art, theory and potential",2020,"Abstract Building Integrated Photovoltaic Thermal (BIPV/T) systems are promising solutions for serving local electricity and heat demands in Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). Despite BIPV/T offering clear energetic and space saving advantages compared to separate BIPV and solar thermal, overheating occurs when no thermal demand exists, resulting in reduced yields, stagnation damage, and excessive fluid pressures. Whilst continuous fluid flows mitigate overheating, corresponding parasitic demands and space requirements are significant (pumps, large storage tanks or heat rejection equipment). This two-part study examines an alternative approach to BIPV/T, addressing overheating by combining BIPV and Integrated Collector-Storage Solar Water Heater (ICSSWH) concepts. Solar heating capabilities of ICSSWH collectors are well established and their overnight heat loss characteristics provide passive overheating control. BIPV-ICSSWH approaches have yet to be investigated extensively. This paper (Part 1 of 2) reviews state-of-the-art and performance benchmarks in BIPV/T and ICSSWH; proposes new performance metrics enabling fairer comparisons; and develops a heat transfer model for BIPV-ICSSWH facade elements employing Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diodes (PLVTD) to regulate absorber temperatures and heat losses.

The investigated PV modules are laminated glasses (PV laminates) suitable for integration in facades and windows.

The reflectors are placed vertically at the facade and track the sun by rotating axially. The concentrating reflector outperforms the reference one in both, thermal and electrical power. The thermal output of the concentration module almost doubles the reference one and the electrical power registered is more than 4.5 times in the case of the concentrating configuration.",Optics; Engineering; Concentrator; STRIPS; Thermal; Facade; Reflector (antenna); Electric power; Track (rail transport); Transmission (telecommunications),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.07.009,journal article,University of Lleida,be
601,049-618-122-142-57X,On the relationship factor between the PV module temperature and the solar radiation on it for various BIPV configurations,2014,"Temperatures of c-Si, pc-Si and a-Si PV modules making part of a roof in a building or hanging outside windows with various inclinations were measured with respect to the Intensity of the solar radiation on them under various environmental conditions. A relationship coefficient f was provided whose values are compared to those from a PV array operating in a free standing mode on a terrace. A theoretical model to predict f was elaborated. According to the analysis, the coefficient f takes higher values for PV modules embedded on a roof compared to the free standing PV array. The wind effect is much stronger for the free standing PV than for any BIPV configuration, either the PV is part of the roof, or placed upon the roof, or is placed outside a window like a shadow hanger. The f coefficient depends on various parameters such as angle of inclination, wind speed and direction, as well as solar radiation. For very low wind speeds the effect of the angle of inclination, β, of the PV module with respect to the horizontal on PV temperature is clear. As the wind speed increases, the heat transfer from the PV module shifts from natural flow to forced flow and this effect vanishes. The coefficient f values range from almost 0.01 m2°C/W for free standing PV arrays at strong wind speeds, vW>7m/s, up to around 0.05 m2°C/W for the case of flexible PV modules which make part of the roof in a BIPV system.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optics; Engineering; Mode (statistics); Radiation; Wind speed; Geometry; Roof; Heat transfer; Intensity (heat transfer); Flow (psychology),http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4897744,conference article,Technological Educational Institute of Patras,gr

Most BIPV glass today uses crystalline silicon absorber layers which are inherently opaque, whereas better transparency could be achieved at a reasonable level of efficiency using other absorber layers such as very thin layers of CIGS or dye sensitive cells.

These foils as a building transparent material have been drawing much more attention for the past decades. In addition, integration of amorphous photovoltaic cells with these ETFE foils is taken into account due to the low production cost and its resistance to high operating temperatures. In the present study, a Building integrated Photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) ETFE cushion roof was numerically modeled and the thermal and electrical performances of this system were obtained in two cases: the cushion with the steady state mass flow and the cushion with the air pressure regulator system. Verification of the modeling was performed by comparing the model's results with the available experimental data in the literature. The main strength of the present modeling is consideration of the air pressure regulator system in the modeling process which has not been studied yet. The result of the present study showed that the present model predicts the BIPV/T ETFE cushion performance with a reasonable accuracy and can predict the system performance under different operating conditions. The results also showed that in case of the cushion with the steady state mass flow, the power generation is 15% higher than that of the cushion with the pressure regulator system.

We analyze beam irradiances of two horizontal pyranometers situated next to a lake, one facing upwards and one facing downwards, to estimate the contribution of Fresnel reflection to the beam irradiance on a vertical surface. We show that in general the observed beam irradiance on the downward facing instrument matches the calculated Fresnel reflection. In contrast to other studies investigating water albedo, we also found that the reflection percentage decreases consistently with higher wind speeds and lower solar zenith angle. Fresnel reflection has the highest contribution for vertical surfaces in winter, with varying contributions between 30% of monthly global irradiance over the course of one year for different latitudes, and should thus be included in yield estimates for building integrated PV installations situated next to bodies of water.",Optics; Fresnel equations; Wind speed; Beam (structure); Pyranometer; Solar zenith angle; Environmental science; Irradiance; Reflection (physics); Albedo,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.07.041,journal article,Zürcher Fachhochschule,ch
615,054-392-617-444-790,Estimating operating cell temperature of BIPV modules in Thailand,2009,"Abstract Several models have been developed to estimate the operating cell temperatures of photovoltaic (PV) modules because they directly affect the performance of each PV module. In this study, two prediction models used most commonly, the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT) model and the Sandia National Laboratory temperature prediction model (SNL), were investigated for their suitability in the prediction of PV module's temperatures for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) installation in the tropical climate conditions of Thailand. It was found that, in general, the SNL model tends to give better results of temperature prediction than those of the NOCT model. Nevertheless, both models are strongly over-biased in temperature predictions. The discrepancies of the predictions are basically caused by the dissimilarity of the BIPV installation and the standard installation as specified by the models, rather than the effect of differences in climatic conditions between the temperate and tropical zones. In the worst case, it was found that the highest value of the mean bias error (MBE) is +8 °C, or equivalent to +21% of the mean observed temperature, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is ±10 °C, or equivalent to ±24% of the mean observed temperature. However, although these errors were large, their effects on the accuracy of the final prediction of the electrical power output generated by the PV module over a long term would not be great. The error of the expected generated energy output would not be more than 6% of the averaged actual energy output, which is acceptable for most applications.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Mean squared error; Meteorology; Energy (signal processing); National laboratory; Electric power; Photovoltaic system; Simulation; Predictive modelling; Term (time),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2009.02.027,journal article,King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi,th

An LCA comparison of agri-urban production and photovoltaic energy generation,2019,"Abstract A key strategy towards sustainable urban development is designing cities for increased circular metabolism. The transformation of areas underused, such as urban rooftops, into productive spaces is being increasingly implemented as a result of associated multiple benefits. Rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) are an interesting option for exploiting urban rooftops with direct exposure to sunlight, reducing food miles and creating new agricultural spaces, while building-applied solar photovoltaic (BAPV) panels provide clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a proper assessment of environmental costs and benefits related to both systems is vital for a successful implementation. By means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, modelled in the professional software SimaPro, this paper aims at comparing the environmental performance of different productive uses of rooftops under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The results showed that both systems are favourable and contribute to decreasing the environmental impacts thanks to the production of resources on-site. BAPV system shows the highest avoided burdens in comparison with RTG: for instance, the impacts generated by BAPV on climate change and fossil depletion categories, corresponding to - 430 kg CO2 eq/m2 and - 110 kg oil eq/m2 respectively (versus - 22 kg CO2 eq/m2 and - 4.7 kg oil eq/m2 in the RTG system), are around 20 times lower than RTG.

Such a matrix was co-reacted upon UV-light exposure with a suitably functionalized perylene-based luminescent organic dye bearing lateral carbon double bonds, to yield the solid crosslinked LSC thin film. A thorough characterization of the new luminescent system evidenced its excellent chemical, physical and optical properties, while its functional performance was evaluated in terms of LSC device response at varying dye concentrations. To assess the long-term stability of the new UV-curable LSC system, a long term (>800 h) light-exposure durability study was conducted on the LSC devices which fully retained their initial performance. In contrast, reference host/guest luminescent systems based on the same UV-curable fluoropolymeric matrix doped with a conventional fluorescent dye exhibited an overall ∼10% efficiency loss in the same time frame. In addition, such a novel UV-curable fluoropolymeric LSC system presented a highly hydrophobic character and moderate oleophobicity, which impart easy cleanability to the LSC coating, as a result of the highly perfluorinated nature of the polymeric matrix. This study represents the first demonstration of highly stable multifunctional UV-curable thin-film LSC systems and gives a clear demonstration of a straightforward room-temperature preparation process that may offer an easily scalable approach to highly stable and multifunctional LSC devices.",Matrix (chemical analysis); Luminescence; Nanotechnology; Covalent bond; Thin film; Materials science; Perylene; Coating; Doping; Fluorescence,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta01692a,journal article,Polytechnic University of Milan,it

Thanks to BIPVs. a new concept of local electric microgrid will probably emerge as this kind of technology can turn buildings from energy wells to energy sources. Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC) panels are perfect to achieve this goal, indeed, contrary to standard flat PhotoVoltaic (PV) modules, they can be exploited in transparent or semi-transparent building facades. Thus, the purpose of this work was the optimization of the performance of LSC panels for BIPV applications. Being an application-oriented study, we paid particular attention to the scalability of the assembling process and the use of LSC slabs functionalized only with widely available organic commercial dyes and high-performance commercial silicon solar cells. The electrical and optical performance of the LSC panels were firstly simulated and then, once the most promising configurations were identified, the respective prototypes were assembled to compare the simulation results with the experimental measurements. These analyses were performed both under uniform illumination and in some relevant shading configurations typical for BIPV devices in operating conditions.

Photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) can improve overall efficiency for PV and also solve the problem of limited roof space at urban area. Objective of this study is to clarify the effect of mass flow rate on the efficiency of the PV/T system. A CIGS solar cell is used with rated output power 65 W and 1.18 m 2 of area. 4 set of experiments were carried out, which were: thermal collector with 0.12 kg/s flow rate, PV/T with 0.12 kg/s flow rate, PV/T with 0.09 kg/s flow rate and PV. It was found that PV/T with 0.12 kg/s flow rate had the highest electrical efficiency, 2.92 %. PV/T with 0.09 kg/s flow rate had the lowest electrical efficiency, 2.68 %. It also had 2 % higher overall efficiency. The efficiency gained is low due to several factors. The rated output power of the PV is low for the area of 1.18 m 2 . The packing factor of the PV also need to be considered as it may not be operated at the optimal packing factor.

In particular, a comparison among innovative building-plant system configurations, based on BIPVT collectors for the simultaneous production of electricity, thermal energy, and domestic hot water, is carried out. The simulation models of the proposed system layouts are designed and implemented in TRNSYS simulation environment for the dynamic assessment of their energy and economic performance. By means of the developed simulation model, the occurring summer and winter building passive energy effects due to the PVT building integration are also analysed. Several case studies are developed by modelling a representative multi-storey residential building and by taking into account different European climates. For such case studies a suitable energy parametric analysis is performed by varying the thermal resistances and capacitances of the building envelope.

A reliable encapsulating layer is required to guarantee outdoor operation for more than twenty years, paying attention to factors like protection from weather agents and humidity, promotion of the adhesion between the active layer and the substrate, and electrical isolation. The most popular encapsulant is a thermoplastic polymer called Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA), which is produced in rolls of extruded thick film. Anyway, another material, Poly-Vinyl Butyral (PVB), seems to be the best choice to satisfy the more demanding mechanical and safety requests in the field of Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV). This is one of the reasons why PVB is nowadays widely used with thin film PV, while EVA is still the standard material for crystalline modules. The success of the qualification campaign of a PV module can strongly depend on the performances of the packaging polymer. Many tests can be done to determine the material properties and predict its behaviour under stress conditions.

Our technology is an alternative to the AlO x based PERC technology for improving multi-crystalline solar cell efficiencies above 18.5% and it is based on standard mass production equipment and wafer quality. An additional unique feature of this technology is the manufacture of bifacial multi-crystalline solar cells with screen-printed finger grid on the rear side instead of a full area Al-BSF. The PERCT cell architecture is based on a “passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT)” cell design for p-type wafers. The totally diffused BSF is realized by a cost effective and short BBr 3 boron diffusion step in a standard diffusion tube furnace - prior to the back side passivation and protection by a PECVD SiN x . RCT's multi PERCT technology upgrade is currently evaluated in an industrial pilot line of a Chinese cell manufacturer. Using the equipment available on site, an average efficiency of 18.4% could be achieved (without front side optimization). Accordingly an efficiency gain of 0.52% absolute was demonstrated on standard multi-crystalline wafer material. A unique feature of the PERCT technology is the opportunity to prepare bifacial cells on multi-crystalline wafer material. The world's first bifacial multi-crystalline solar cell with a screen printed Al-grid and a front side efficiency of 18% was realized.

Furthermore, values for the effective heat transport coefficients are obtained from ?cold-flow? experiments by means of model fitting, with and without taking the radial velocity profile into account. The radial porosity and velocity profiles are approximately by step-function, which is referred to as the ?two-region model?. It is shown that the effective radial heat conductivity can be taken constant over the radius, despite the wall effect. Nevertheless, the influence of a radial superficial velocity profile can be significant through the convective term in the heat balance, especially for low tube-to-particle diameter ratios. The predicted NTU can increase the order of 20% for high values of the Reynolds number and up to 100% for low values. This is confirmed by the results obtained from the model fitting. In case of a first-order exothermic reaction, significantly higher values for the hot-spot temperatures are predicted, if a radial porosity and velocity profile is incorporated in the heat and mass balances. This is found to be mainly caused by the non-uniform distribution of active catalyst over the radius, due to the porosity profile.",Convection; Chemistry; Superficial velocity; Heat transfer coefficient; Radial velocity; Exothermic reaction; Heat transfer; Porosity; Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2509(94)80023-5,journal article,"Chemical Reaction Engineering Laboratories, Department of Chemical Engineering, Twente University of Technology, PO Box 217, 7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands",nl

647,061-861-838-239-62X,A Study of the Electrical Output and Reliability Characteristics of the Crystalline Photovoltaic Module According to the Front Materials,2020,"In recent years, various types of installations such as floating photovoltaic (PV) and agri-voltaic systems, and BIPV (building integrated photovoltaic system) have been implemented in PV systems and, accordingly, there is a growing demand for new PV designs and materials. In particular, in order to install a PV module in a building, it is important to reduce the weight of the module. The PV module in which low-iron, tempered glass is applied to the front surface, which is generally used, has excellent electrical output and reliability characteristics; however, it is heavy. In order to reduce the weight of the PV module, it is necessary to use a film or plastic-based material, as opposed to low-iron, tempered glass, on the front surface. However, if a material other than glass is used on the front of the PV module, various problems such as reduced electrical output and reduced reliability may occur. Therefore, in this paper, a PV module using a film instead of glass as the front surface was fabricated, and a characteristic analysis and reliability test were conducted. First, the transmittance and UV characteristics of each material were tested, and one-cell and 24-cell PV modules were fabricated and tested for electrical output and reliability. From the results, it was found that the transmittance and UV characteristics of the front material were excellent. In addition, the electrical output and reliability test results confirmed that the front-surface film was appropriate for use in a PV module.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Transmittance; Automotive engineering; Materials science; Front (oceanography); Toughened glass; Photovoltaic system; Reliability (semiconductor),http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14010163,journal article,"Photovoltaic Laboratory, Korea Institute of Energy Research, 152 Gajeong-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34129, Republic of Korea",kr

Their performance depends on a number of parameters but the nanoparticles dispersion and distribution state remains the key challenge in order to obtain the full nanocomposites’ potential in terms of, e.g., flame retardance, mechanical, barrier and thermal properties, etc., that would allow extending their use in the industry. While the amount of existing research and indeed review papers regarding the formulation of nanocomposites is already significant, after listing the most common applications, this review focuses more in-depth on the properties and materials of relevance in three target sectors: packaging, solar energy and automotive. In terms of advances in the processing of nanocomposites, this review discusses various enhancement technologies such as the use of ultrasounds for in-process nanoparticles dispersion. In the case of nanocoatings, it describes the different conventionally used processes as well as nanoparticles deposition by electro-hydrodynamic processing.

To manage this effect, different methods were developed to measure it; however, most existing evaluation methods are either based on subjective speculations and have no continuous criteria standards, or they do not show much relevance to neuropsychological findings. This paper presents an alternative and complementary method for evaluating the BIPV visual impact using the saliency method with an objective, quantitative and neuropsychological-based approach. The application of the method was tested and is discussed in the context of an example case study in Switzerland. Several different BIPV designs were developed for the case study, purposely in ways that made it difficult to rank their visual impacts with one’s subjective instinct. Using the proposed saliency method; however, the differences in BIPV visual impact across all designs could be identified, demonstrated and calculated sensitively. Potential applications of this proposed method include being a helping tool in deciding which BIPV design causes the least or most visual impact among others.

652,063-724-185-435-966,Application of life cycle thinking towards sustainable cities: A review,2017,"Abstract Defining sustainable cities is not straightforward. The main issues involved in urban sustainability are buildings, energy, food, green areas and landscape, mobility, urban planning, water and waste; and their improvement is promoted through different strategies. However, a quantitative method, such as life cycle thinking (LCT), is essential to evaluating these strategies. This paper reviews LCT studies related to urban issues to identify the main research gaps in the evaluation of these improvement strategies. The review identifies the main sustainability strategies associated with each urban issue and compiles articles that deal with these strategies through LCT, including environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), social LCA (S-LCA) and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), as well as integrated analyses with combined tools. Water, waste and buildings are the urban issues that accounted for a larger amount of studies. In contrast, a limited number of papers assessed urban planning and energy (excluding energy in buildings). Strong interrelations among urban issues were identified, most of them including water. In terms of methods, 79% of the studies exclusively applied life cycle tools (i.e., LCA, LCC, S-LCA or LCSA). Within this group, the environmental dimension was the focus of 84% of the papers. Single environmental indicators (e.g., global warming) were common in 20% of the analyses, highlighting the need to integrate more impact categories to prevent trade-offs. In the field of social and sustainability assessment, there is a need for methodological advances that foster their application in urban areas. Further research should cover the thematic and methodological gaps identified in this paper, such as developing models that assess complex urban issues, generating comprehensive LCT studies and promoting multi-indicators. Life cycle tools might benefit from revising the methodology with stakeholders to optimize the understanding and communication of life cycle results for policy- and decision-making processes.",Environmental resource management; Global warming; Engineering; Urban metabolism; Life cycle thinking; Life-cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Urban sustainability; Urban planning; Sustainability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.030,journal article,Autonomous University of Barcelona,es

Given the environmental stresses on the planet today, it is critically important that these new urban areas have little or no negative impacts. A comprehensive assessment of these impacts will include all operational factors – energy, water, food, and transportation – as well as all the embodied consequences of construction and maintenance. This analysis can be expressed in units of energy (to build and operate the city, grow food, treat and desalinate water, and travel); as well as in units of area required to accommodate housing, grow food, and generate solar energy (photovoltaic generation area is used as the most universally available form of renewable energy). This study models a new city for 1,000,000 inhabitants in a temperate climate, built in the year 2050. A comprehensive footprint of the city is established, given certain assumptions about lifestyle, diet and technology. The resulting area required for the city to be self-sustaining is then evaluated in terms of density. In other words, can cities themselves be entirely sustainable, and can a self-sustaining community be considered a city?",Footprint; Civil engineering; Natural resource economics; Renewable energy; Population; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.434,journal article,"Kiss + Cathcart, Architects, New York",us
654,064-017-790-574-175,Thin‐film silicon solar cell technology,2004,"This paper describes the use, within p–i–n- and n–i–p-type solar cells, of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) thin films (layers), both deposited at low temperatures (200°C) by plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), from a mixture of silane and hydrogen. Optical and electrical properties of the i-layers are described. These properties are linked to the microstructure and hence to the i-layer deposition rate, that in turn, affects throughput in production. The importance of contact and reflection layers in achieving low electrical and optical losses is explained, particularly for the superstrate case. Especially the required properties for the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) need to be well balanced in order to provide, at the same time, for high electrical conductivity (preferably by high electron mobility), low optical absorption and surface texture (for low optical losses and pronounced light trapping). Single-junction amorphous and microcrystalline p–i–n-type solar cells, as fabricated so far, are compared in their key parameters (Jsc, FF, Voc) with the [theoretical] limiting values. Tandem and multijunction cells are introduced; the μc-Si: H/a-Si: H or [micromorph] tandem solar cell concept is explained in detail, and recent results obtained here are listed and commented. Factors governing the mass-production of thin-film silicon modules are determined both by inherent technical reasons, described in detail, and by economic considerations. The cumulative effect of these factors results in distinct efficiency reductions from values of record laboratory cells to statistical averages of production modules. Finally, applications of thin-film silicon PV modules, especially in building-integrated PV (BIPV) are shown. In this context, the energy yields of thin-film silicon modules emerge as a valuable gauge for module performance, and compare very favourably with those of other PV technologies.

In tropical climates, although rooftops are ideal for photovoltaic (PV) module integration, the available area may be insufficient to meet building energy demand due to the increase in high-rise urban buildings, causing a requirement for the utilisation of facades. However, the high solar elevation angle means that facades are unfavourably oriented towards receiving incident irradiation. Also, the issue exists of high solar heat gains into built spaces. This paper evaluates the utilisation of horizontally inclined PV integrated shading strategies to combat these issues based on the urban context of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Various strategies are evaluated in terms of their inclination angles and the distance between installations, and urban blocks in Colombo are analysed in terms of how they affect the solar potential in the urban canyon. The results are analysed in terms of economic potential to determine the optimised installation strategies based on urban block type. The results suggest that installations inclined at 30° at a distance-to-length ratio of 4 provide the greatest economic viability in this context.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architectural engineering; Shading; Economic potential; Context (language use); Sri lanka; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Urban density; City block,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.116908,journal article,General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University,lk

This is due to their flexibility, free-shape, variable color and semitransparency, light weight, cost-effectivity, and low environmental impact. In addition, electrical generation is provided. Four configurations of ETFE foils designed to be integrated onto a south facade glazing element were studied for two representative European locations with different climatic conditions: Barcelona and Paris. These configurations comprise a reference one based on a double ETFE foil with a 10 mm air gap in between, and the other three incorporate on the inner ETFE foil either OPV cells covering 50% or 100% of its surface or a shading pattern printed on it covering 50% of its surface. Results show that, in terms of energy, the configuration with higher OPV coverage area is the one achieving the lowest net energy consumption in both locations. However, when looking at the illumination comfort this option results in insufficient illumination levels. Therefore, a tradeoff strategy balancing energy performance and illumination comfort conditions is necessary. Based on that, the best solution found for both cities is the configuration integrating OPV cells covering 50% of the glazing area and for a window to wall ratio of 0.45.",Materials science; ETFE; Facade; Building integration; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Air gap (plumbing); Glazing; Engineering physics; FOIL method,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12101870,journal article,University of Lleida,es

In addition, we calculated the distribution of daylight illumination into the office and dimming ratios for the individual control of LED lights. Also, we were able directly to use the electric power generated by PV system. As a result, power consumption for electric lighting was reduced by 40 – 70% depending on the season and the weather conditions.

The approach was tested by means of a demonstrator consisting of N=3 flyback converters. Each converter was equipped with separate MPPT.

The use of standard OPC for monitoring enables data acquisition from a set of devices that use different communication protocols as inverters or other electronic devices present in PV systems enabling universal connectivity and interoperability. Using the OPC standard allows promoting interoperation of software objects in distributed-heterogeneous environments and also allows incorporating in the system remote supervision and diagnosis for the evaluation of grid connected PV facilities. The supervision system analyses the monitored data and evaluates the expected behaviour of main parameters of the PV array: Output voltage, current and power. The monitored data and evaluated parameters are used by the fault detection procedure in order to identify possible faults present in the PV system. The methodology presented has been experimentally validated in the supervision of a grid connected PV system located in Spain. Results obtained show that the combination of OPC monitoring along with the supervision and fault detection procedure is a robust tool that can be very useful in the field of remote supervision and diagnosis of grid connected PV systems.

The RESSEEPE framework is being validated by a strong demonstration programme, envisaging the renovation of 102,000 square metres of public buildings. The core idea of the project is to technologically advance, adapt, demonstrate and assess a number of innovative retrofit technologies implemented on several pilot cases with different climate conditions across Europe (Coventry-UK, Barcelona-Spain and SkellefteA¥-Sweden) to ensure a high potential replication of the retrofit solutions. The three demonstration sites are involved as the main promoters of a very ambitious district level renovation, demonstrating a systemic approach to technology installation and evaluation, taking into account the benefits of a set of technologies, which properly combined in terms of cost effectiveness and energy performance could achieve reductions around 50% in terms of energy consumption. Coventry University is acting as a Living Lab in order to test some advanced technologies already in the market and others developed specifically within the RESSEEPE project. Those innovative technologies implemented in the pilot case are: Vacuum Insulated Panels, PCM tubes, Ventilated faA§ade with Photovoltaic Panels, Electrochromic windows and Aerogel Mortar. The main feature of this installation is that it acts as a testing bed for where to install different advanced technologies covering specific areas of the building, rather than refurbishing it as a whole. This paper documents the testing of prototype technologies in a pilot case in Coventry University, analysing the process of selection of the different technologies and showing all the challenges faced during installation and coordination of installation activities.

Although there are good number of available technologies to clean the glass covers of solar panels, however, self-cleaning coatings, with extreme wettability, is emerging as one of the most reliable solution which can be easily applied and at the same time comes with low cost. Such coatings should be not only good at keeping the PV modules clean but at the same time should maintain the transparency of solar glass covers so as to allow maximum light to enter the surface of encapsulated solar panels. Most importantly such self-cleaning glazing structures have become very much useful in diverse field of solar energy application areas, such as solar radiation transmission, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar panels, concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. Here we have developed a facile sol–gel based highly transparent and self-cleaning coating with tunable wetting property, by synthesizing single component silane modified base and acid catalyzed mixed silica sol. The sol is coated by following dip-coating approach on glass substrates. A static contact angle (WCA) as high as 150° and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) of ∼2° has been achieved with these coatings. The maximum transmission of glass used in solar glass cover has been found to increase from 91.8% to 95.5% and concomitantly minimum reflectance has been found to reduce from 8.7% to 3.2%.

The monthly average daily solar radiation on a horizontal surface and the daily sum distributions of solar radiation show that the solar radiation intensity is quite high in Hong Kong except the wet period from January to March. The mean annual global radiation is 4646.8 MJ/m/sup 2/. The potential electricity generating capacity from BIPV systems is estimated to be 10.5 TWh which is about 35% of the total annual electricity supply (29.9 TWh) in Hong Kong in 1995 if the shadow facades of the high-rise buildings are excluded.

This paper discuss the feasibility of grid connected Roof-top/Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system for the electrification of consumption wise three different residential households with incorporating feed in tariffs/ net metering process along with Tariff of day (ToD) tariff regulation in the New Delhi, India. HOMER has been used to carry out the techno-economic evaluation of grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system. The simulation indicates that the cost of energy (COE)) and Net Present Cost (NPC) become 0 at around 1.8 kW and 3.4 kW for low and middle slab household. Moreover, high slab demand households required large infrastructure and greater capital to obtain effective results. The results clearly identify that feed in tariff/net metering and time of day (ToD) tariff regulation are majorly impact on low and middle slab households rather than high slab households. It has been observed that COE is continuously decreased with capacity addition as well as linearly increase with battery storage independent of power consumption.

However, the range of solar cell colours and shapes currently offered by suppliers is still very limited and this is a barrier to the widespread use of PV modules as constructional components. Initial investigations of the colour and efficiency of Laser Grooved Buried Contact (LGBC) solar cells as a function of the thickness of the LPCVD silicon nitride antireflection coating were reported in the late 1990s, but the subsequent commercialisation of coloured cell products has been limited in part by the difficulty in controlling the uniformity and reproducibility of colour in large scale cell production. The aim of the present work is to understand and control the processes that affect the thickness and hence colour of the silicon nitride ARC. Process conditions were optimised to enable the formation of antireflection coatings with thicknesses in the range 90 nm to 400 nm. LGBC solar cells were fabricated in 5 colours on both non-textured Cz and partially textured multicrystalline wafers.

679,072-839-672-692-456,Experimental operating cell temperature assessment of BIPV with different installation configurations on roofs under Mediterranean climate,2014,"Abstract The presence of an air gap between a photovoltaic (PV) module and roof facilitates ventilation cooling under the device and consequently reduces cell temperature and improves its performance. In case of rack-mounted PV installation, the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT) method could be effectively used to predict the temperature of the module for various environmental conditions. Many countries, for esthetic purposes, offer economic advantages (tax deductions, incentives, etc…) for the installation of building integrated photovoltaic modules (BIPV), with water-tightness capability and adequate mechanical resistance in order to substitute tile covering or part of it. Nevertheless, poor or absent ventilation under BIPV panels could cause them to overheat and reduce their efficiency. Lack of validated predictive tools for the evaluation of BIVP energy performance could be another barrier to their widespread application. In this study, we investigated the thermal performance of PV modules installed in a real scale experimental building over a traditional clay tile pitched roof in Italy for almost one year (from August 2009 to June 2010). One PV module was rack-mounted over the roof covering with a 0.2 m air gap; the others were fully integrated and installed at the same level of the roof covering (one with an air gap of 0.04 m, the other mounted directly in contact with the insulation). Temperature and heat flux measurements for each panel, and environmental parameters were recorded. Two temperature prediction models, NOCT model and SNL (Sandia National Laboratory) model were used to predict BIPV temperature and energy efficiency so that their suitability for BIPV could be evaluated. SNL model takes into account also the wind speed. Experimental results demonstrate that even though the rack-mounted PV module constantly maintains cell temperature below that of the other full-building integrated modules, due to the presence of a higher air gap, the difference in the energy produced by the BIPV modules estimated for the entire monitoring period is less than 4%. The two predictive models, NOCT and SNL, cause the differences in predicted and calculated temperature up to 10 °C. However, subsequent percentage variations on the energy predicted compared to that arising from the temperature measured generally turn out to be lower than 5%. An optimization of empirical coefficients used for calculations based on the SNL method allows for the reduction of this value below 2.5%.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Heat flux; Wind speed; Automotive engineering; Efficient energy use; Roof; Tile; Photovoltaic system; Air gap (plumbing); Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.02.009,journal article,Marche Polytechnic University,it

Tests were done with an inclined 3 × 2 module for four air gap thicknesses varying from 0 cm (BIPV) to 5.5 cm (BAPV) and five freestream approaching wind speeds from 1 to 5 m s−1. Wind speed and temperature were measured along the central line of the module, on the top (illuminated) as well as on the back (shaded) side. Short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage were determined from I-V measurements, and the maximum power was calculated. The wind and temperature patterns and the electrical performance were considerably affected by the mounting setup. The BAPV configurations were always better cooled by the wind than the BIPV setup because of the additional cooling in the air gap. Although a better cooling does not automatically guarantee a higher electrical performance, the BAPV configurations showed the highest performances in the test. In addition, the development of a boundary layer above and (in the case of BAPV) below the module and the trapping of heat into it, created a surface temperature gradient that significantly affected the electrical performance of the individual solar cells in the module. This is important because in most PV modules, solar cells are connected in series. Since the operational temperature influences mainly the open-circuit voltage, the open-circuit voltage of the whole module, and hereby the power output, will be determined by the behavior of each individual solar cell. In the tests reported here, the BAPV module with the thickest air gap (5.5 cm in this study) was the best performing configuration.",Wind tunnel; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Maximum power principle; Wind speed; Voltage; Materials science; Solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Air gap (plumbing); Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2018.05.043,journal article,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,be

Since the beginning of2020, the IUG was retrofitted by a Building Applied Photovoltaic (BAPV) power system constituting a hybrid SPV mini-grid as a partial green solution to the frequent grid outages. The hybrid SPV mini-grid is composed of 480kWp rooftop SPV as an intermittent Renewable Energy Source (RES) which synchronizes either with two on-site diesel generator units in island mode or with the centralized macro-grid in grid-tied mode through Net Energy Metering (NEM) agreement with GEDCo for billing purposes. Technically, the system is found to be resilient and capable of supplying electric power to essential loads at IUG campus efficiently. It was found that the aggregate SPV system is capable of generating a total of approximately 13GWh over an assumed 20 years project lifetime. It was found that it can also increase the overall electrical system efficiency by reducing the LV electrical technical losses and curtailing the need for additional grid rehabilitation investments. Financially, the project’s capital cost was approximately 0.6 MUSD. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) throughout the lifetime of the project was found to be about 0.04$/kWh which is competitive compared with the GEDCo per unit energy price. The diesel fuel consumption was minimized and the energy bill from GEDCo was lowered. Accordingly, it was found that the project shall recover its capital cost within the first three years of operation.

Instead of conventional p-type a-Si:H, p-type hydrogenated microcrystalline Si oxide (p-μc-SiOx:H) was introduced for a wide-bandgap and conductive window layer. For these purposes, we tuned the CO2/SiH4 flow ratio (R) during p-μc-SiOx:H deposition. The film crystallinity decreased from 50% to 13% as R increased from 0.2 to 1.2. At the optimized R of 0.6, the quantum efficiency was improved under short wavelengths by the suppression of p-type layer parasitic absorption.

This resulted in an increase in photocurrent generation through the luminescent down-shifting (LDS) process. The optical properties of these films were characterized through UV–vis spectroscopy. The impact of the film on the micro-module was studied through current–voltage (I–V) and external quantum efficiency measurements. Further layers were added to the initial single-layer LDS film, however no additional improvement to the micro-module were observed. Additionally, a range of emission wavelengths have been explored.

However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. In the present paper, the case of photovoltaic power sources in regions of moderate insolation is analysed critically by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (ERoEI, also called EROI). But the methodology for calculating the ERoEI differs greatly from author-to-author. The main differences between solar PV Systems are between the current ERoEI and what is called the extended ERoEI (ERoEI EXT). The current methodology recommended by the International Energy Agency is not strictly applicable for comparing photovoltaic (PV) power generation with other systems. The main reasons are due to the fact that on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density.",Engineering; Environmental economics; Economy; Energy (signal processing); Renewable energy; Solar electricity; Energy agency; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Insolation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.034,journal article,"Energy Consultant, Zurich, Switzerland",ch

However, it is still to determine the public's acceptance of innovations of the traditional solar PV architecture. Building applied photovoltaic technology (BAPV) is a technological innovation that can be installed over existing building surfaces. This study compares an evaluation of the conscious and subconscious attitudinal, control and normative beliefs of American homeowners when randomly primed with two brochures depicting the purchasing, installation, and commissioning of solar PV systems, developed according to the characteristics of conventional and an adhesive “plug and play” BAPV system. The survey instrument (N = 400 survey participants) was designed in consonance to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). When comparing the direct measures for each solar PV technology, no significant differences were found. This may indicate that for those unfamiliar with PV technology, placing an adhesive backing module on the roof is standard procedure and does not impact purchasing intentions. The evaluation further showed that unlike the subconscious control beliefs, social norms and attitudes have a significant impact on forming intentions to adopt solar PV.

Grey-box models are based on a combination of prior physical knowledge and statistics, which enable identification of the unknown parameters in the system and accurate prediction of the most influential variables. The experimental data originates from tests carried out with an air-based BIPV system installed in a Test Reference Environment. BIPV systems represent an interesting application for achieving the requirements of the EU EPBD Directive. Indeed, these systems could reduce the ventilation thermal losses of the building by pre-heating the fresh air. Furthermore, by decreasing PV module temperature, the ventilation air heat extraction can simultaneously increase electrical and thermal energy production of the building. A correct prediction of the PV module temperature and heat transfer coefficients is fundamental in order to improve the thermo-electrical production. The considered grey-box models are composed of a set of continuous time stochastic differential equations, holding the physical description of the system, combined with a set of discrete time measurement equations, which represent the data driven part. In the present work, both one-state and two-state non-linear grey-box models are considered.

This SWF is necessary to evaluate broadband-average optical properties from their spectral values, and obtain the desired rating of such bulk properties. The SWFs currently specified by rating institutions in Europe and North America for SHGC and VT are now outdated, and their inadequacies are discussed. Six potential replacements, which have been recently adopted by ASTM are described, including three direct irradiance spectra and three global irradiance spectrum incident on tilted surfaces of various tilts (20°, 37° and 90°). Some of these spectra have been tailored for use in building energy applications, including Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). The effect of tilt on the U-factor and hence SHGC of glazing systems used for skylights on roofs is discussed, using a representative dataset of 37 glazing system specimens. The spectral effects on SHGC induced by a change in the current North American SWF are also obtained for this dataset, and show small to moderate deviations from current ratings (−2% to +7% for windows, and −3% to +11% for skylights). The variations in VT are within ±2% for most glazing systems. To remove the current inconsistency in the SWFs used for SHGC and VT, it is recommended that a single SWF be used for both properties. For improved accuracy and reliance on active standards, it is also recommended that the SWF for SHGC and VT be either one of the two recent ASTM G197-08 global irradiance spectra, depending on application (incidence on a vertical surface for window applications, and incidence on a 20°-tilted surface for skylight applications).

However, the effect of PV integration on environmental impact is not fully understood. In this study a single indicator for environmental impact assessment of BIPV is investigated in the Netherlands. A BIPV rooftop with 24 multi-crystalline 60-cell modules has been designed with and without backside ventilation, and the environmental impact of these configurations has been assessed in the current situation and three future scenarios. The results are expressed in terms of electricity output difference (ΔEout), Energy PayBack Time (EPBT), and the single indicator Land Claim (LC); the calculated claim in land-time on the carrying capacity to realize the BIPV rooftop. The EPBT calculations are based on two different datasets, SimaPro and the Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE), and the LC calculations are based on two different models, SimaPro and MAXergy. Calculations indicate that the ventilated BIPV rooftop design generates 2.6% more electricity than the non-ventilated BIPV rooftop design on a yearly basis. Calculations indicate that the EPBT of the ventilated BIPV rooftop design (3.56 and 4.59 years, based on SimaPro and ICE, respectively) is 9 and 6% longer than the EPBT of the non-ventilated BIPV rooftop design (3.25 and 4.32 years, based on SimaPro and ICE, respectively). Calculations indicate that the LC of a m2 ventilated BIPV rooftop design (24.4 and 19.4 m2 a, based on SimaPro and MAXergy, respectively) is 18 and 10% higher than the LC of a m2 non-ventilated BIPV rooftop design (20.0 and 17.4 m2 a, based on SimaPro and MAXergy, respectively). In the optimal future scenario EPBT might decrease to 2.06 years and LC might decrease to 10.6 m2 a.

A performance evaluation criterion (PEC) is defined in this study to assess the overall performance of a BIPV/T system from exergy point of view. Then, the mentioned method is utilized to identify a relationship between the input and output parameters of the BIPV/T system. The parameter PEC was taken as the essential output of the BIPV/T system, while the input parameters were channel length, channel depth, channel width, and air mass flow rate. Prior to PSO, variables of ANN algorithm were optimized. In addition, PSO influential parameters such as swarm size, personal learning coefficient, global learning coefficient, and inertia weight were optimized using a series of trial-and-error process. The predicted results for data sets from ANN and PSO–ANN models were evaluated according to several known statistical indices and novel ranking systems of color intensity rating and total ranking method.

This type of prediction is often based on accelerated ageing and tests in indoor condition. However, the combination of different phenomena, such as the mean solar radiation available on the site, the presence of dust, the shadowing or UV radiation over long-outdoor exposure, affect in different ways the real performance of the PV systems. This paper presents a detailed assessment of the testing campaign on the pilot PV plant at the Politecnico di Milano, which underwent 13 years of continuous operation; such period is particularly representative because it can be considered as about half of the supposed lifetime cycle of a photovoltaic system which is usually taken into account for technical–economic evaluations. The results obtained show that the PV plant analyzed didn’t present a significant decrease in long-term performance: the measured PR decay is equal to 0.37%/year. In addition, the visual inspection and IR analysis showed that no PV modules are affected by serious damage. This result is due to a good system design during the preliminary stage, high-quality components and also the back ventilation of the modules, which avoids overheating in the warmer periods of the year.

Currently, full integration of photovoltaic elements in a building is a very costly and complex undertaking, as it usually requires expensive custom modules. In order to increase the market share of BIPV in the residential mass market, a low-cost, flexible technical process to change the appearance of solar elements is required. Transparent conductive electrodes consisting of an oxide-metal-oxide (OMO) stack of thin layers have been optimized for application in thin film solar cells. Here the OMO stack is multifunctional: It provides the transparent front contact electrode and at the same time allows tuning of the module colour. This has several advantages compared to other colouring techniques, i.e. coloured glass or additional interlayers. The OMO colouring does not require an additional process step, and with sputtering an already existing deposition method is used. By varying the thickness of the oxide layers it is possible to change the reflected spectrum of the stack and with it the module colour. In this publication, we present how the optical model of the OMO stack, that is necessary for precise tuning of the colour, is first developed for OMO/glass samples and then report the changes necessary to adapt the OMOs for use on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin film solar cells.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Footprint (electronics); Electrode; Materials science; Electrical conductor; Sputtering; Thin layers; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Stack (abstract data type),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tsf.2019.06.012,journal article,"DLR Institute of Networked Energy Systems, Urban and Residential Technologies, Carl-von-Ossietzky-Str. 15, 26129 Oldenburg, Germany",de

Fault detection in such systems is imperative to improve their reliability, productivity, safety and efficiency. Here, an innovative model-based fault-detection approach for early detection of shading of PV modules and faults on the direct current (DC) side of PV systems is proposed. This approach combines the flexibility, and simplicity of a one-diode model with the extended capacity of an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart to detect incipient changes in a PV system. The one-diode model, which is easily calibrated due to its limited calibration parameters, is used to predict the healthy PV array’s maximum power coordinates of current, voltage and power using measured temperatures and irradiances. Residuals, which capture the difference between the measurements and the predictions of the one-diode model, are generated and used as fault indicators. Then, the EWMA monitoring chart is applied on the uncorrelated residuals obtained from the one-diode model to detect and identify the type of fault. Actual data from the grid-connected PV system installed at the Renewable Energy Development Center, Algeria, are used to assess the performance of the proposed approach.

A large potential for BIPV deployment is related to building facades. The assessment of BIPV facades depends on the accurate modelling of exterior convective heat transfer coefficients (eCHTC). However, eCHTC models commonly used in BIPV modelling tend to be simplified. This paper proposes a simulation framework that combines detailed computational fluid dynamics with a multi-physics BIPV model to investigate the influence of eCHTC on the performance of BIPV facades (cell temperature and power). The evaluation is performed for different building geometries, wind speeds, wind directions, solar irradiations, and ambient temperatures. The results show that local variations in eCHTC can cause variations in cell temperature up to 42 ° C between the BIPV modules across the facade. These temperature differences are associated with differences in power up to 17% across the BIPV facade. In general, lower temperatures (and higher power output) occur near the edges of the facade while higher temperatures (and lower power output) occur at the middle and at the bottom of the facade. Therefore, a detailed assessment of wind effects is recommended in order to verify the local operating conditions of the BIPV modules. The framework and findings presented in this work are relevant for applications in which the knowledge of the local behaviour is important, such as degradation studies.",Wind direction; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Zero-energy building; Renewable energy; Facade; Environmental science; Convective heat transfer; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116538,journal article,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,be

710,083-293-142-283-361,The Influence of Operating Temperature on the Performance of BIPV Modules,2020,"To investigate the effect of the operating temperature on the performance of building integrated photovoltaic modules, two different crystalline silicon (c-Si) module types (glass/backsheet and glass/glass) with two different mounting configurations (ventilated and insulated) were installed in Canobbio, Switzerland and monitored over more than four years outdoors. The differences in the performance loss rates (PLRs) between module types and mounting configurations were determined by using the year-over-year methodology. The glass/backsheet module was markedly affected by the higher operating temperature: PLR changed from 0.01%/yr for ventilated to $-$ 0.42%/yr for insulated. However, the glass/glass module showed an opposite and unexpected trend: PLR changed from $-$ 0.10%/yr for ventilated to 0.26%/yr for insulated. Analysis of the IV curve parameters revealed that the decreased performance of the insulated glass/backsheet module was chiefly due to the loss in the fill factor with increased resistance; however, the gain in the short-circuit current ( I sc) was the main driver for the increased performance of the insulated glass/glass module. Real-world temperature coefficients were further examined and they were mostly found to be in line with the values measured indoors. Lower power–temperature and higher current–temperature dependence of the insulated glass/glass module, compared to the ventilated construction, supported the observed performance and current behavior of this module.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Operating temperature; Composite material; Materials science; Crystalline silicon; Energy resources; Fill factor; Photovoltaic system; Temperature measurement; Current–voltage characteristic,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jphotov.2020.3001181,journal article,Gebze Institute of Technology,tr

Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is a promising technology that can accelerate the transition to energy-neutral buildings. Quantifying the potential of BIPV is crucial and one means of obtaining those results is through simulation. The state-of-the-art tools offer either thermal or electrical specialization; in particular, balance of system components (BOS) such as power converters have not been studied in detail within the building simulations BIPV domain. In this paper, a multi-physics model of a BIPV integrated DC/DC converter is developed in the Modelica language, taking into account the thermal and electrical couplings inherent to power electronic systems. The model has been validated using representative outdoor BIPV measurements and a DC/DC converter prototype. It has been found that the proposed model provides reasonable accuracy and outperforms an equivalent power conditioning model in TRNSYS. To demonstrate the model’s functionality, two case studies are performed. First, the temperature-dependence of the converter’s efficiency and losses is quantified and analyzed and, second, the prominent contributors to the converter losses are identified and discussed.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Power (physics); Automotive engineering; Efficient energy use; Converters; TRNSYS; Balance of system; Modelica; Computer science; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.071,journal article,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,be

Thus, research efforts focused on improving energy efficiency and material efficiency are considered extremely relevant. In the following work, the influence of incorporating PCMs (phase change materials) on electricity conversion efficiency discussed along with hot spot prevention and lifetime increases in BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics). The main goal is to evaluate the operational temperature control in a BIPV with or without PCMs considering different climatic severities. A design parameter analysis was conducted, and the importance of suitable PCMs and proper system designs are revealed. Also, this study indicates that areas with different climatic severities must be considered for widespread evaluations of this technology application to impact diverse regions. Additionally, an environmental analysis based on the LCA (life cycle assessment) methodology was performed using the SimaPro software. The results show that a positive environmental impact is generated by PCM applications because of the decreased amount of consumed resources in BIPV manufacturing, which is related to the lifetime extension resulting from the ability of PCMs to store latent heat and prevent premature physical damage to the BIPV.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Sustainable design; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Process engineering; Efficient energy use; Material efficiency; Life-cycle assessment; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.01.101,journal article,"Research Centre for Energy Resources and Consumption (CIRCE), CIRCE Building – Campus Río Ebro, Mariano Esquillor Gómez, 15, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain",es

In France, photovoltaic (PV) installations under 3 kW p represent 90% of the plants in service as of 2009, and count for 42% of the national installed photovoltaic powe r (1). Residential BIPV installations are not only characterized by there relatively small peak power but also by their sensi tivity to perturbed environmental conditions such a s partial shading. Partial shading of BIPV plants can be caused by several fac tors such as nearby trees, chimneys or buildings, c onsequently causing PV module mismatch losses. Such losses are mainly due to the dispersion in electrical characteristics of interconnected modules which leads to significant decrease in plan t energy production. The introduction of additional power converters in the plant layout intends to reduce the influence of one module on the entire installation, thus reduci ng module mismatch.

Homebuyers can easily roll the cost of the PV system into their tax-deductible home mortgage and, with rebates and other financial incentives, potentially achieve an immediate net-positive cash flow from the investment. 1 New homes are amenable to building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which are less susceptible to aesthetic concerns than traditional, rack- mounted systems. The performance of PV systems can be optimized on new homes by taking roof orientation and shading into account Case Study Details......... 6 Key Issues 17 Summary and Recommendations ....... 25 February 2006 Download other clean energy fund case studies from: http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/EMS/cases/ or www.cleanenergystates.org PV systems installed on existing homes could be financed through a home equity loan or by refinancing the mortgage, in which case the interest would be tax-deductible. However, new homes would still have a financing advantage in that no separate transaction would be required, thereby greatly simplifying the process for the customer. when designing the home. 2 Perhaps most importantly, subdivisions with PV systems installed on a large number of homes offer potential cost savings from volume purchases of modules and inverters and from scale economies in system design and installation. 3 Finally, the ability of builders to install PV as a standard Though more aesthetically pleasing, BIPV systems may operate at higher temperatures, and therefore lower conversion efficiencies, than standard rack-mounted systems. These sources of up-front cost savings may be most applicable when PV is installed as a standard feature on multiple homes in new developments and may be offset, to some extent, by other factors. For example, builders that install PV as a standard feature may tend to opt for smaller systems in order to minimize the impact on home prices or profits, which would tend to raise the unit cost per watt (KEMA-Xenergy 2004a and 2004b). Also, BIPV, which is often used in new construction, is generally more expensive on a dollar per watt basis than standard, rack- mounted PV (and may also have lower performance, as mentioned previously).",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Business; Home equity loan; Economies of scale; Systems design; Photovoltaic system; Market rate; Database transaction; Unit cost,http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/883792,journal article,"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

After the emulator experimental validation a fault diagnosis technique is introduced to detect and to identify certain defects based on the power losses and the parameters extracted from ABC-DE technique selected on a reference table.",Metaheuristic; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Fault coverage; Engineering; Fault (power engineering); Fault detection and isolation; Reliability engineering; Fault indicator; Equivalent circuit; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/irec.2015.7110911,conference article,"Automatic Laboratory of Setif, Elec.

733,092-086-567-632-488,Performance of BIPV modules under different climatic conditions,2019,"Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology has gained attention as a solution to achieve low energy buildings. However, unlike conventional PV applications, BIPVs typically operate at non-optimal orientation, imposed by the building geometry. Moreover, the building integration reduces the heat exchange to the exterior, leading to higher temperatures. This paper investigates the performance of BIPV modules in different locations by simulating a representative office room in a high-rise building having a BIPV facade. The locations considered are Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), Seville (Spain), Naples (Florida, USA), Cape Town (South Africa), and Munich (Germany). The facade is vertical and faces the equator for all locations. Results show the highest annual BIPV energy yield occurs in Seville, followed by Cape Town, Riyadh, and Naples. In terms of monthly yields, the highest values are observed in Riyadh and Seville in wintertime. Monthly yield is more uniform over the year in Munich, while important differences between summer and winter have been obtained for Riyadh. These results confirm the influence of the latitude on the BIPV yield, with equator-facing facades in high latitudes receiving up to 40 % less irradiation compared to a horizontal surface, with important reductions especially in the summer. In these locations, the use of west and east facades may be necessary to achieve a balanced profile over the year. Moreover, the highest average cell temperatures occur in Riyadh, Naples and Seville, while lowest temperatures are verified in Cape Town and Munich, which is consistent with the corresponding ambient temperatures. Finally, with lower BIPV temperatures and relatively high solar irradiation, Cape Town achieves the highest performance ratio (PR) values. Conversely, the combination of high solar irradiation and high temperatures leads to lower PR values in Riyadh and Seville.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Latitude; Facade; Performance ratio; Low energy; Building integration; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Climatology,http://dx.doi.org/10.32438/wpe.6519,journal article,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,be

However, these tools generally provide a spatial resolution of a few kilometers and, for a systematic analysis at large scale, they require continuous querying of their online databases. In this article, we present a methodology for fast estimation of the yearly sum of global solar irradiation and PV energy yield over large-scale territories. The proposed method relies on a multiple-regression model including only well-known geodata, such as latitude, altitude above sea level and average ambient temperature. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for a fast, preliminary, offline estimation of solar PV output and to analyze possible investments in new installations. Application of the method to a random set of 80 geographical locations throughout Europe and Africa yields a mean absolute percent error of 4.4% for the estimate of solar irradiation (13.6% maximum percent error) and of 4.3% for the prediction of photovoltaic electricity production (14.8% maximum percent error for free-standing installations; 15.4% for building-integrated ones), which are consistent with the general accuracy provided by the reference tools for this application.

The resulting luminescence is transported to the edge of the LSC sheet and concentrated onto photovoltaic devices. This paper outlines the loss mechanisms that limit conversion efficiency of the LSC and highlights the role that advanced materials can play. Losses include nonunity fluorescence quantum yield (FQY), reabsorption losses, incomplete utilization of the solar spectrum, and escape cone losses. Long-term photostability is also discussed as it is essential for commercial feasibility of any solar technology. The main motivation for implementing an LSC is to replace the large area of expensive solar cells required in a standard flat-plate PV panel, with an inexpensive polymeric collector, thereby, reducing the cost of the module (in dollars per watt) and also of the solar power (in dollars per kilowatthour). A key advantage of LSC technology compared to other concentrating systems is that it can collect both direct and diffuse solar radiation. This means that tracking of the sun is not required—enhancing further potential cost reductions and making LSCs excellent candidates for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV)—as well as making them the ideal PV technology for cloudier northern European climates. Similarly to electricity conversion, LSCs also have applications in daylighting (Hiramoto et al., 1991), thermal conversion, and hybrid thermal–photovoltaic systems that could generate electricity and extract the heat generated by the LSC plate (Xue et al., 2005).",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Daylighting; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Energy conversion efficiency; Solar power; Luminescent solar concentrator; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics; Engineering physics,http://journals.usamvcluj.ro/index.php/agriculture/article/view/6543/5839,journal article,National Research and Development Institute for Cryogenics and Isotopic Technologies – ICIT,ro

Despite the fact that there are many examples showing that PV can be an aesthetically neutral or visually attractive element in architecture, many BIPV systems display few architectural qualities. But if well applied, PV can increase a building's character and value. Within Task 7 of the IEA PVPS programme a team of experts with an architectural background studied which key requirements needed to be complied with (design criteria for good-quality PV projects) in order to produce successful PV integration. These criteria are discussed in the article.; ; ; ; PV is not automatically considered an indispensable material in architectural terms. This is why, no matter how well it is integrated, PV remains an ‘added’ element. Architects can take this as their starting point and can use one of the design approaches that are presented in the article. These criteria for incorporating PV in the building design and the design criteria for good-quality PV projects are important to architects and architectural critics in determining why a BIPV project, be it their own design or that of a colleague, is or is not aesthetically pleasing. This offers learning opportunities and reasons for follow-up or improvement options.

Sprache nicht verfügbarPurpose; ; Improving technical properties and the durability of wood-based products by modification in various processing technologies is subject to recent research and development activities. This study aimed at integrating environmental considerations during the research and development phase of a novel modification process for a multilayer wood parquet. Due to expected challenges when applying Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in this phase, the eco-profile of the modified multilayer wood parquet was referred to the original multilayer parquet by estimating payback period and identifying other payback options.; ; Methods; An LCA was conducted during the research and development phase of the modification process at laboratory scale and is characterized as ex ante environmental screening of a newly developed technology. The environmental assessment of new products and manufacturing processes during the research and development phase, however, faces multifarious challenges, such as the definition of a functional unit and the service life length. In order to overcome these challenges, the idea was to answer the question under which circumstances the modification process pays back from the perspective of non-renewable energy use and global-warming potential. Aside from investigation of payback period, the feasibility of other payback options was systematically searched.; ; Results and discussion; The extra resource input and the resulting increase in environmental burden of the modification of the multilayer parquet can be justified with the extension of service life length by 10 to 20 %, referring to global warming potential and non-renewable energy use, respectively. Other payback options found were adjusting chemical loading during modification, making renovations superfluous, or reducing transport effort. Other than transportation and renovation, which are user-dependent, only the modification lies within the scope of the parquet producer.; ; Conclusions; The payback concept is found suitable for comparative estimations on the magnitude of change in environmental performance of product variants during research and development. By investigating on multiple payback options, it was enabled to frame the change in environmental performance, which is essential in order to define the scope of further research and development in a target-oriented way.

Homebuyers can easily roll the cost of the PV system into their mortgage and, with rebates or other financial incentives, potentially realize an immediate net positive cash flow from the investment. PV system performance can be optimized by taking roof orientation, shading, and other structural factors into account in the design of new homes. Building- integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which are subject to fewer aesthetic concerns than traditional, rack-mounted systems, are well-suited to new construction applications. 1 In large new residential developments, costs can be reduced through bulk purchases and scale economies in system design and installation. Finally, the ability to install PV as a standard feature in new developments – like common household appliances – creates an opportunity to circumvent the high transaction costs and other barriers typically confronted when each individual homeowner must make a distinct PV purchase decision. Along with its unique advantages, the market for PV on new homes also faces significant challenges. Most fundamentally, perhaps, is the general aversion to technology risk within the building industry, particularly in “hot” housing markets. Builders also have specific reservations about PV related to its impact on home prices and profits, potential project delays, and a perceived lack of homebuyer interest. Furthermore, many builders may not recognize or fully value the potential benefits that PV offers for their business, including greater market differentiation, enhanced media exposure, and less community or political opposition to development projects. Recognizing its potential, various initiatives have been launched in the U.S. to support the growth of the new home market for PV, including programs aimed at promoting zero-energy homes (ZEH) and, most recently, a proposal in California for a 10-year, $350 million program specifically for PV in new homes. In addition to these high-profile initiatives, various organizations throughout the U.S. – at the local, state, and federal levels – have undertaken important efforts to encourage PV in new homes. In particular, clean energy funds, currently established in fourteen U.S. states and with more than $5 billion to invest in renewable energy over the next decade, have emerged as leaders in these efforts. 2 This article, based on a longer report prepared by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 3 for the Clean Energy States Due to their higher operating temperature, however, BIPV systems may not perform as well as rack-mounted systems.

The surface mapping method provides the commercial developer with a practical tool to evaluate the potential for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The solar maps identify the optimum roof and facade areas available for solar energy utilization. The importance of BIPV and facade utilization in new city developments is discussed, along with key questions raised by the commercial developer regarding the practical implementation of BIPV solutions. Based on feedback from the building industry, a simplified model has been implemented to evaluate surface areas producing a profit or a loss over the PV system lifetime. As tilted photovoltaic (PV) modules installed on flat roofs are not building integrated, three simulation variants have been performed for flat roofs with a small inclination up to ten degrees. For some buildings this will give a small gain in annual PV production and payback time. The resulting 3D solar maps give the developer a possibility to review early-stage plans in terms of building shapes and positions in the landscape, in order to maximize utilization of the available solar resource.

The objective of this paper is to introduce an improved design for PV cladding systems that will greatly contribute to meeting these renewable energy goals. Typically, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels are vertically oriented as cladding and they are not coupled with individual storage batteries. The proposed cladding couples a tilted BIPV panel with one or more storage batteries at each building placement. Thus, the tilted BIPV plus battery system is independent of other power generation in the building and it is referred to as a “building perma-power link” (BPPL) cladding element. Each cladding panel is designed as a stand-alone system, which will be useful for installation, operation, and maintenance. The hyper-redundancy of multiple BPPL cladding panels for a typical building significantly enhances its overall energy resiliency.

Various expressions for the forced heat convection coefficient available in the literature are tested within the thermal model with reference to the windward and leeward side of the PV module, and their applicability to PV thermal analysis is experimentally assessed in terms of the agreement shown with measured data.

The fabricated TMEs consisted of a bottom layer (BL) of gallium doped zinc oxide (GZO), an Ag-layer, and optoelectronic-controlling layers (OCLs) of GZO; and exhibited a high transmittance of 90% at 550 nm, and a low sheet resistance of 9.4 Ω/sq. at the thickness of ~ 100 nm. Because the Ag of TMEs easily detach from inorganic or amorphous surfaces, the GZO-BL was chemically treated in a diluted acetic and nitric acid mixture (10:2) to generate changes in its surface energy and improve the Ag adhesion. To quantitatively evaluate the Ag adhesion of TMEs, we proposed and conducted a tape pull-out adhesion test, and found the optimum GZO-BL texturing condition. The developed TMEs were used as the front transparent conductive electrodes of transparent a-Si:H solar cells to tune their reflection colors. By changing the thickness of the OCL, a wide range of colors was obtained without serious efficiency variations, as was predicted by optical simulations. The fabricated transparent cells show a high efficiency of 4.8%, as well as a high average transmittance of ~ 20% in the visible range.

The temperature characteristics in regard to improve the output of BIPV system has rarely been studied up to now but some researchers only proposed the method using a ventilator. The efficiency of this cooling system applied to a ventilator mainly depend on the weather such as wind, irradiation etc. Because this cooling system is so sensitive, that is always being set off by velocity of wind but is unable to operate in the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT) which is able to make the maximum output. This paper proposes the cooling system using thermoelectric element so as to solve such problems. The temperature control of thermoelectric element can be controlled independently in the outside environment because that is performed by micro-controller. Also, it can be operated around NOCT through algorithm of the temperature control. Therefore, the outputs of the system are increased and the efficiency is risen.

These azimuth and tilt angles are significantly influenced by the shadow of the neighborhood’s buildings. The relative height, plan orientation, plan area, position, and horizontal distance of the neighborhood’s buildings are critical parameters for determining optimum azimuth and tilt angle to receive maximum insolation.

The periodic nature of relevant parameters is considered in the thermal modeling of the BiSPVT system. Results indicate that the optimum azimuth angle from south-facing increases with a rise in the latitude angle of the place. The optimum tilt angle depends on the corresponding latitude and the different contributing parts of total insolation. The electrical output of a south-facing BiSPVT system with a tilt angle equal to latitude is increased by 3.7% when BiSPVT system is installed at optimum azimuth and tilt angle.

The role of architects in this process should not only be to increase the volume of building integrated PV, but also to make comprehensive, integral designs, which include sunlight shading, thermal insulation, energy saving, passive use of solar energy, and obviously also photovoltaics. Furthermore, architects could make an important contribution to establishing a new, sustainable urban environment in which BIPV is used on a large scale as a distributed source of energy. This fits well within the new international effort in the framework of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Photovoltaic Power Systems (PVPS), Task 10.

If the common targets of substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the next few decades are going to be met, it is in the urban environment where change must happen. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are commonly seen as one appropriate measure to reduce urban carbon emissions through power generation and as an aid to promote behaviour change of occupiers to contribute to the goal of more sustainable cities. Solar photovoltaics (PV) are often applied as an ‘add-on’ solution to existing building structures in an aesthetically less than pleasing manner, representing a technological and environmental statement but not always a testament to good design. A more sensitive integration of PV into buildings (glazing, cladding, roo.ng or shading systems) can offer additional benefits by offsetting the costs of expensive materials (e.g. high-value cladding) or by providing additional functions such as solar shading.

784,117-076-334-109-772,The Optimum Performance of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) Windows Under a Semi-Arid Climate in Algerian Office Buildings,2020,"Recently, Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) windows have become an alternative energy solution to achieve a zero-energy building (ZEB) and provide visual comfort. In Algeria, some problems arise due to the high energy consumption levels of the building sector. Large amounts of this energy are lost through the external envelope facade, because of the poorness of the window’s design. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the optimum BIPV window performance for overall energy consumption (OEC) in terms of energy output, heating and cooling load, and artificial lighting to ensure visual comfort and energy savings in typical office buildings under a semi-arid climate. Field measurements of the tested office were carried out during a critical period. The data have been validated and used to develop a model for an OEC simulation. Extensive simulations using graphical optimization methods are applied to the base-model, as well as nine commercially-available BIPV modules with different Window Wall Ratios (WWRs), cardinal orientations, and tilt angles. The results of the investigation from the site measurements show a significant amount of energy output compared to the energy demand. This study revealed that the optimum BIPV window design includes double-glazing PV modules (A) with medium WWR and 20% VLT in the southern facade and 30% VLT toward the east–west axis. The maximum energy savings that can be achieved are 60% toward the south orientation by double-glazing PV module (D). On the other hand, the PV modules significantly minimize the glare index compared to the base-model. The data extracted from the simulation established that the energy output percentages in a 3D model can be used by architects and designers in early stages. In the end, the adoption of optimum BIPV windows shows a significant enough improvement in their overall energy savings and visual comfort to consider them essential under a semi-arid climate.",Alternative energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Energy (signal processing); Window (computing); Facade; Energy consumption; Cooling load; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12041654,journal article,"Department of Architectural Engineering, Ha’il University, Ha’il 2440, Saudi Arabia",sa

We used scattering matrix analysis to simulate the transmittance characteristics of the semitransparent solar cells fabricated using the HB layers and showed that the HB layers shifted the transmission peak to longer wavelengths. We used a figure of merit (FOM), the product of the efficiency and the average transmittance in the range 400–800 nm, to represent the performance of the semitransparent solar cells and compared the FOMs of the cells fabricated for application to BIPV windows. The cell fabricated using triple HB layers showed the highest FOM, more than 20% higher efficiency than the reference cell (fabricated without using any HB layers), and its transmittance was similar to that of the reference cell.

To investigate the short and long term effect of backside ventilation on Building Integrated PV (BIPV) performance and lifespan, a comparative BIPV field test is conducted in a real life lab located in the Netherlands. The field test includes 24 modules in 4 segments with different levels of backside ventilation. PV energy output, module backside temperature, relative humidity in the air gap, and air velocity in the air gap have been monitored for three years in the period January 2013–December 2015. At the end of the monitoring period Electric Luminescence (EL) images were made and Standard Testing Condition (STC) power was determined. The ventilated segments show a similar behaviour (6% difference) in PV energy output, but the non-ventilated segment shows a strong decrease of 86% in output after three years. A maximum temperature of 72 °C is reached in the ventilated segments and a maximum temperature of 83 °C in the non-ventilated segment. Relative humidity (RH) levels reach a maximum of 100% in all segments. Air velocity in the non-ventilated segment is 13–39% of the air velocity in the ventilated segments. STC power determination and EL imaging show lower peak power and more defects in the non-ventilated modules, and modules placed at vertical higher positions in the non-ventilated segment have a lower power output of 50–60%. The results indicate that, considering the first generation Metal Wrap Through (MWT) modules investigated, the non-ventilated BIPV modules exposed to the highest temperatures show the lowest power output, lowest STC power and show the most damaged cells in the EL imaging.

795,121-071-680-740-884,Toward a Sunny Future? Global Integration in the Solar PV Industry,2010,"Policymakers seem to face a trade-off when designing national trade and investment policies related to clean energy sectors. They have pledged to address climate change and accelerate the large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies, which would benefit from increased global integration, but they are also tempted to nurture and protect domestic clean technology markets to create green jobs at home and ensure domestic political support for more ambitious climate policies. This paper analyzes the global integration of the solar photovoltaic (PV) sector and looks in detail at the industry’s recent growth patterns, industry cost structure, trade and investment patterns, government support policies and employment generation potential. In order to further stimulate both further growth of the solar industry and local job creation without constructing new trade and investment barriers, we recommend the following: (1) Governments must provide sufficient and predictable long-term support to solar energy deployment. Such long-term frameworks bring investments forward and encourage cost cutting and innovation, so that government support can decrease over time. A price on carbon emissions would provide an additional long-term market signal and likely accelerate this process. (2) Policymakers should focus not on solely the manufacturing jobs in the solar industry, but on the total number of jobs that could possibly be created including those in research, project development, installation, operations and maintenance. (3) Global integration and broader solar PV technology deployment through lower costs can be encouraged by keeping global solar PV markets open. Protectionist policies risk slowing the development of global solar markets and provoking retaliatory actions in other sectors.

As the building was designed in the 60's with a peculiar architectural language, it has been protected by the conservation authorities. However, the construction system in exposed concrete and the large expanses of single glass make the energy performance of the building very poor. The Provincia di Varese, owner of the building, decided to realize an exemplary retrofit project, which would be the first renovated educational building in Italy in line with the future scenario of Nearly Zero-Energy Building expected from 2019 (2021 for private buildings) by the European Directive 2010/31/UE. In this work energetic and payback analysis are developed to delineate three different preliminary scenarios of intervention. The process has always followed discussions with the conservation authorities, which contributed to the definition of realistic scenarios. Interesting results are obtained: a potential energy demand reduction of 70% can be obtained with the passive solutions proposed; in combination with active strategies (efficient mechanical systems and controls) and with the integration of photovoltaic panels (BiPV), the overall energy need of the building can be reduced to nearly zero.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Work (electrical); Zero-energy building; Demand reduction; Directive; Microgeneration; Photovoltaic system; Intervention (law),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.02.150,journal article,Polytechnic University of Milan,it

The objective of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) panels in residential houses in Qatar.  A typical Villa-type house is assessed when BIPV is installed and the equivalent annual cost at different discount rates from 0% to 20% is calculated. The corresponding reduction of CO 2 emission at the power station is also estimated. The results are then extrapolated for all residential houses in Qatar and the total CO 2 savings are then calculated.  An economic analysis is performed and the payback period (PBP) for the BIPV is calculated taking into account the initial cost and the maintenance cost. The calculations performed showed that the cost per kWh is 6.85 cents, thus the annual cost per house at 0% discount rate is around $4,193 including savings on CO 2 emissions. The PBP for the BIPV is calculated to be 34 years. The total CO 2 emissions’ savings are estimated to be around 2.17 MtCO 2 per year which is equivalent to 65 million USD per year.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Cost efficiency; Engineering; Payback period; Energy consumption; Population; Cost effectiveness; Photovoltaic system; Agricultural economics; Waste management; Equivalent annual cost,https://ijrer.com/index.php/ijrer/article/view/1328/pdf,journal article,Qatar Computing Research Institute,qa

Therefore it happens that the socio–economic situation of many of these settlements is backward and depressed. A succesful way to develop these important environments is to implement tourism, a profitable and available economical resource. “Spread Hotel” or “Diffuse Hotel” or “Albergo Diffuso” is an innovative concept which aims to renovate decayed buildings situated in historical locations. New economical inputs are needed to revitalize these settlements and their social tissue. “Diffuse Hotel” concept is very diffused in Italy due to its rich historical heritage. The present paper displays a renovation project of a rural historical settlement into a “Spread Hotel”. The site under analysis is located in Palazzolo Acreide, Sicily, Italy. The settlement strongly needed to be refurbished in order to provide habitability and to guarantee a proper level of comfort according to italian standards. The area is also listed in the UNESCO Heritage. The “Diffuse Hotel” at a national level is considered as an affordable and comfortable concept that enables the travellers to experiance Italy through a tipical, historical and comfortable hotel. The historical built enviroment preservation is strategic in Italy and can strongly support economical revitalization. European Community supports the development of “Spread Hotels” projects in order to improve economical capacity of depressed areas by financing refurbishment programs.

The insolation and optimum tilt angle values are based on modified HDKR (Hay, Davies, Klucher, Reindl) model which accounts for hourly insolation considering shadow effect. Electrical and thermal performance of semi-transparent BIPV thermal system is evaluated for different mass flow rate of air through the duct with series combinations. EPBT and LCC of BIPV thermal systems are evaluated for three different orientations of PV modules i.e., optimum tilt angle, horizontal and vertical orientations by considering adverse effect of shadow. The cost of energy produced by the system ranges between 1.61 and 3.61 US$/kW h depending on the climatic conditions of the place and the EPBT of the system is found to be ranging between 7.30 years and 16.9 years which is lower than the expected service life (30 years) of the modules. Both LCCA and EPBT are increased because of shadow effect but these values are decreased due to air flow through the duct which is provided below the PV module. Thus, the BIPV thermal system is viable both financially and environmentally and this may be used as a major renewable energy source.

This manuscript provides an overview of potential BIPV electrical architectures. System-level criteria for BIPV installations are established, thus providing a reference framework to compare electrical architectures. To achieve modularity and to minimize engineering costs, module-level DC/DC converters preinstalled in the BIPV module turned out to be the best solution.

Therefore, in order to apply bifacial solar cells to buildings, a bifacial PV module performance analysis should be carried out, including consideration of the various design elements and reflecting a wide range of installation conditions. This study focuses on the performance of a bifacial BIPV module applied to a building envelope. The results here show that the design elements of reflectivity and the transparent space ratio have the greatest impact on performance levels. The distance between the module and the wall had less of an impact on performance. The bifacial BIPV module produced output up to 30% greater than the output of monofacial PV modules, depending on the design elements. Bifacial BIPV modules themselves should have transparent space ratios of at least 30%. When a dark color is used on the external wall with reflectivity of 50% or less, bifacial BIPV modules with transparent space ratios of 40% and above should be used.

The main causes well known: partial shadows, temperature effects, PV inverter losses, thermal losses, etc. and mismatching losses. Ideally, all the modules work in the same conditions, but differences between modules really exist due to differences in the working temperature, the inclination or orientation angles, differences in the I–V characteristic coming from the manufacturing process, etc. The effect is that the output power of the complete PV system is lower than the addition of the power of each PV module. These mismatching losses can be decreased by means of suitable electronics. This paper presents the experimental results obtained over PV systems equipped with controlled PV modules, PV modules with low cost and high efficiency DC–DC converters, including MPPT algorithm and other functions, such as power control and Power Line Communications (PLC). Tests have been divided into two great categories: tests on the electronic performance of the DC–DC converter and tests on grid-connected PV systems with multiple DC–DC converters. Many of these tests have been carried out taking advantage of the PV System Test Platform, a powerful tool especially designed by Robotiker to evaluate all kind of PV systems, especially systems with differences between modules. Aspects of the DC–DC converter performance have been detailed and among the most important experiments, the paper analyses different situations such as partial shadows, different inclined planes, PV systems with different PV modules, and finally a comparison between a conventional system and a system composed by controlled PV modules have been described.

From a system efficiency and cost perspective, an LVDC microgrid is preferred over a traditional AC grid to interconnect the BIPV modules inside the building. To address the problem of partial shading and further reduce the engineering effort and subsequent installation costs, Module-Level Converters (MLCs) are preferred. The frame-integration, however, rises questions regarding protection and safety of the installation. Assuming the converters cannot be serviced after installation, a high reliability and hence fault-tolerance is required. This paper will focus on LVDC pole-to-earth faults in the context of BIPV MLCs. The current state-of-the-art in commercially available systems is given and recommendations concerning the used grounding configuration and protection methodologies are formulated.

Through the overlapping of the energy and construction sector, one of the initiatives that the government has done after research and development is the Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) program. However, though more than ten years have passed after the introduction of BIPV, the implementation is still considered very weak as it is still not a common practice in the construction industry. One of the reasons is because many are still sceptical about BIPV especially among house buyers and are more concern to the prices of the houses. The other factor is developers are dormant in using BIPV and have limited support in BIPV information that can convince house buyers make their decision to invest into BIPV. This research investigates the application issues faced by the developers, their outlook on BIPV and considerations for selection on BIPV. A three stage Delphi interview with eight developer companies as part of a purposive sample is applied, where stage one focuses on the application issues that is faced by developing and stage two the depth of the issues with workable solutions is proposed and validated among the developing consensus. Stage three helps mapping out crucial criteria of selection process that the developers will employ and other consideration towards BIPV. The preliminary results show that more establish developers have employed green technology, but none has considered BIPV yet with cost as a major factor in mind. Their process of selection is not established and individual has various interests that needed to be maintained. It can be concluded that developers indeed are a substantial catalyst for implementing BIPV. This study proposes a guideline to achieve a stronger implementation of BIPV for a more sustainable housing project among the developers.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Government; Architectural engineering; Systems engineering; Housing industry; Delphi; Photovoltaic system; Process (engineering); Sample (statistics); Sustainability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.548,journal article,"Senior Lecturer,",my

In terms of Indonesia's topology, the Solar Power Plant is most suitable for use in rural (remote) areas, known as the Solar Home System (SHS). This system is preferred because it is small in scale and uses a direct current (DC) system. This system can reduce costs because it does not use an inverter. But the weakness of this system is the difficulty of finding home electronic equipment such as TV, Radio / Tape and others that use DC, so the SHS system is not attractive to use.

The aviation industry is a main contributor towards green house gas emission. In this regard, aviation industry as a whole and airports in particular are trying to limit their carbon foot print. A feasible solution is to substitute the conventional electricity energy consumption of airport with clean energy sources. Solar PV route is considered as non polluting source of electricity but MW scale plant requires more land area.

The great advantages of BIPV systems should be enough to achieve their massive implantation, but the difficult working conditions of the urban environment reduce the energy yield and increase the payback period of investment. In order to boost the energy yield of BIPV systems distributed PV system architectures seem to be the solution. In this sense, TECNALIA developed a new distributed DC-DC converter PV system architecture. These electronic devices, commonly called power optimizers, eliminate almost all the mismatching losses between modules and increase the system energy output. The performance of these distributed architectures is much better than centralized ones for high mismatched PV systems. However, for no mismatched cases centralized architectures present higher overall system efficiencies and energy yields. This makes the decision of which architecture is the most suitable one not so easy. In order to quantify the advantages and disadvantages in the performance of these types of architectures, the present abstract summarizes the experimental results of both architectures in real and identical working conditions. The tests have been performed in two independent PV fields, one with distributed architecture and the other one with the typical centralized one. The work carried out has consisted in generating different type of mismatching situations common in an urban environment. The tested working conditions are related to different irradiation levels, type of irradiation, orientation and inclination, shadows, dirtiness and reflexions conditions. Other aspects related to the double operation of MPPT systems (inverter and power optimizers) have also been tested.

Methodological background, application and validation in Geneva (solar cadaster)",2018,"The paper presents the core methodology for assessing solar radiation and energy production on building rooftops and vertical facades (still rarely considered) of the inner-city. This integrated tool is based on the use of LiDAR, 2D and 3D cadastral data. Together with solar radiation and astronomical models it calculates the global irradiance for a set of points located on roofs, ground and facades. Although the tool takes simultaneously roofs, ground and facades, different methods of shadow casting are applied. Shadow casting on rooftops is based on image processing techniques. On the other hand, the assessment on facade involves first to create and interpolate points along the facades and then to implement a point-by-point shadow casting routine. The paper is structured in five parts: (i) state of the art on the use of 3D GIS and automated processes in assessing solar radiation in the built environment, (ii) overview on the methodological framework used in the paper, (iii) detailed presentation of the method proposed for solar modelling and shadow casting, in particular by introducing an innovative approach for modelling the Sky View Factor (SVF), (iv) demonstration of the solar model introduced in this paper through applications in Geneva’s building roofs (solar cadaster) and facades, (v) validation of the solar model in some Geneva’s spots, focusing especially on two distinct comparisons: solar model versus fisheye catchments on partially inclined surfaces (roof component); solar model versus photovoltaic simulation tool PVSyst on vertical surfaces (facades). Concerning the roof component, validation results emphasize global sensitivity related to the density of light sources on the sky vault to model the SVF. The low dense sky model with 145 light sources gives satisfying results, especially when processing solar cadasters in large urban areas, thus allowing to save computation time. In the case of building facades, introducing weighting factor in SVF calculation leads to outputs close to those obtained by PVSyst.

Saidur et al., 2007). This percentage is expected to rise rapidly in the near future. Therefore, it is critical to reduce the dependance of electricity generation based on fossil fuel and substitute it by renewable energy source. Malaysia being located at Equatorial region, has great potential for harnessing solar energy. One of the proven solar energy technology is Building Integrated Photovoltaic technology or also known as BIPV. BIPV is not new in Malaysia as it was introduced into Malaysia since year 2000 but until today it still encounters many barriers for penetration into public realm especially in urban residential sector. Therefore, identification of these non-technical barriers in the Malaysian urban residential sector through public response is vital so that strategies can be drawn for more rapid diffusion of BIPV into Malaysian urban residential sector. In order to draw a framework for analysis, it is important to understand the public awareness and perception of this emerging renewable technology in Malaysia. According to Farhar, B.C., (1996), perceptions are important because what people believe to be real is real in its consequences and perceptions and preferences are themselves facts that describe the social world in which people operate. Farhar, B.C., (1996), also pointed out that people perceptions and preferences about energy and the environment are influenced by objectively factual information. In this research, a purposive sample of 302 Kuala Lumpur households was developed, and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Each of these interviews was undertaken with structured questionaires.

As far as RES residential applications are concerned, the grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems constitute the most important representative of RES, because PVs can be easily installed even in densely built-up areas. In this context, small residential PV systems utilising Building Integrated PV (BIPV) modules are going to gain ground mainly at newly built or rebuilt building structures. That is because a BIPV module operates as a multi-functional building construction material; it generates energy and serves as part of the building envelope.

Nevertheless, poor or absent ventilation under BIPV panels could cause them to overheat and reduce their efficiency. It is well established that the presence of an air gap between a photovoltaic (PV) module and roof covering facilitates ventilation cooling under the device and consequently reduces cell temperature and improves its performance. In this study, we investigated the thermal performance of PV modules installed in a real scale experimental building over a traditional clay tile pitched roof in Italy for almost one year (from August 2009 to June 2010). One PV module was rack-mounted over the roof covering with a 0.2 m air gap; the others were fully integrated and installed at the same level of the roof covering (one with an air gap of 0.04 m, the other mounted directly in contact with the insulation). Temperature and heat flux measurements for each panel, and environmental parameters were recorded. Experimental results demonstrate that even though the rack-mounted PV module constantly maintains cell temperature below that of the other full-building integrated modules, due to the presence of a higher air gap, the difference in the energy produced by the PV modules estimated for the entire monitoring period is less than 4%.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Civil engineering; Heat flux; Automotive engineering; Thermal; Roof; Tile; Mechanical resistance; Photovoltaic system; Air gap (plumbing),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2013.11.018,journal article,Marche Polytechnic University,it

More than 80% of the absorbed solar energy is dumped to the surroundings again after photovoltaic conversion. Hybrid PV/T systems consist of PV modules coupled with the heat extraction devices. The PV/T collectors generate electric power and heat simultaneously. Stabilizing temperature of photovoltaic modules at low level is higly desirable to obtain efficiency increase. The total efficiency of 60–80% can be achieved with the whole PV/T system provided that the T system is operated near ambient temperature. The value of the low-T heat energy is typically much smaller than the value of the PV electricity. The PV/T systems can exist in many designs, but the most common models are with the use of water or air as a working fuid. Efficiency is the most valuable parameter for the economic analysis.

865,175-452-308-000-466,Experimental investigation of a low cost passive strategy to improve the performance of Building Integrated Photovoltaic systems,2015,"Abstract A typical problem of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BiPV) is the power loss due to temperature increase caused by limited cooling compared to free standing photovoltaic (PV) systems. Higher operating temperatures have a negative effect both on the efficiency and lifetime of the PV system. Decreasing the PV operating temperature in BiPV applications is thus a crucial aspect to both enhance the system efficiency and to decrease the temperature-induced degradation process. This study investigates the effectiveness of a passive low-cost strategy to improve the PV performance of BiPV systems by decreasing the module temperature. It consists in the application of an heat sink system on the PV module back side to enhance the PV cooling. An experimental investigation was performed on a wooden BiPV facade prototype and the results show that this strategy could lead to a temperature reduction up to 5.2 °C, meaning a possible power output increase of 2.3% of the PV nominal power. Considering a South facing facade application in Agrigento (South of Italy) climate, this strategy could enhance the annual PV energy generation for an extent of 1.2% and the total PV energy generation over the whole module life-time for an extent of 31% due to a longer life-time (considering some assumptions reported in the paper).",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Operating temperature; Automotive engineering; Heat sink; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Facade; Environmental science; Nominal power (photovoltaic); Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2014.11.001,journal article,"Institute for Renewable Energy, EURAC, Viale Druso 1, 39100 Bolzano, Italy",it
866,175-458-787-415-905,Simulating building integrated photovoltaic facades: Comparison to experimental data and evaluation of modelling complexity,2021,"Abstract Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems provide an opportunity for renewable energy generation in the built environment. In order to quantify the BIPV potential, numerical models of varying levels of complexity have been developed. This paper investigates how the complexity of BIPV models affects their predictions. The study starts with a detailed multi-physics BIPV model that combines a high-resolution one-diode model with physics-based thermal and airflow models. Next, simplifications are introduced into the model. The model predictions are compared to experimental data from a BIPV curtain wall installed in a test building in Leuven, Belgium. The results show that the detailed BIPV model is capable of estimating the BIPV daily energy yield with an average difference of 6.2 % (2.0 % for clear sky days) and the back-of-module temperature with an average difference of 1.74 °C. The use of a linear power model instead of a high-resolution one-diode model affects the average differences, but not significantly: 8.7 % for daily energy yield predictions (4.5 % for clear sky days) and 1.71 °C for temperature predictions. The use of two different empirical temperature correlations instead of a physics-based approach increases the average temperature difference to 3.5 and 4.4 °C. The average difference in daily energy yield increases to 10.2 and 10.4 %, respectively (5.9 and 5.5 % for clear sky days). These findings indicate that the detailed version of multi-physics BIPV model provides the best agreement with experimental data, but it is still possible to reduce the model complexity with acceptable accuracy.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Airflow; Renewable energy; Curtain wall; Photovoltaic system; Simulation; Solar energy; Experimental data; Sky,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116032,journal article,Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,be

In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the usage of renewable green energy must be promoted. The International Energy Agency showed that renewables have surpassed coal as the largest source of installed power capacity; half a million solar panels are installed every day around the world. The Taiwanese government has planned to block its fourth nuclear power plant, and is closing Taiwan’s three operating nuclear power plants since solar energy is the best way to solve power shortages. This study defined a solar-energy building as a Building-Attached Photovoltaic (BAPV) system in which the solar modules can be attached to and detached from the building without any structural damage; then, we proposed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to forecast and explain public acceptance of BAPV. Last, we explored consumers’ intentions to use the BAPV systems and their purchasing behavior. The analytical results are fairly consistent with the proposed hypotheses. We find that when perceived ease of use (PEOU) is the antecedent of perceived usefulness (PU) and attitude toward using (AT), the model fit shows a positive influence. However, when PEOU directly affects AT, it shows a negative influence. These two opposing results show that consumers lack an awareness of PEOU. In order to get a positive AT, PEOU and PU have to be synergized. Further, the PEOU also has a negative influence on the antecedent of AT, but positively affects purchasing behavior.",Environmental economics; Business; Renewable energy; Technology acceptance model; Purchasing; Nuclear power plant; Photovoltaic system; Greenhouse gas; Nuclear power; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10114177,journal article,"Department of Management Sciences, Tamkang University, No. 151, Yingzhuan Rd., Danshui Dist.

Real cities are even more complex, since built on different periods, with different trends or programs.

The scope of this paper is to propose a way of analyzing existing urban environments, composed of thousands of elements, in order to optimize their forms on physics criteria - here the maximization of the solar potential on windows and roofs, which determine respectively the passive solar heat gains and the active solar energy through the utilization of solar panels such as building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV).

However, when the temperature in the BIPV increases, the conversion efficiency deteriorates. APV/PCM system using Phase Change Materials(PCM) for BIPV thermal control has been experimentally and numerically studied previously. One of the main barriers for this application is how to improve the low thermal conductivity of the PCM in order to achieve a quick thermal dissipation response with longer thermal regulation in PVs. Although the metal fins inserted inside the PCM can improve the heat transfer, the thermal regulation period declines as the volume of the PCM is substituted by the metal mass of the PV/PCM system. A modified PV/PCM system integrated with two PCMs with different phase transient temperatures for improving the heat regulation needs to be investigated. The use of combinations of PCMs, each with a set of different phase transient temperatures, is expected to enhance the thermal regulation effect of the PV/PCM system and lengthen the thermal regulation time in PVs. In this study a developed PV/PCM numerical simulation model for single PCM application has been modified to predict the thermal performance of the multi-PCMs in a triangular cell in the PV/PCM system. A series of numerical simulations tests have been carried out in static state and realistic conditions in UK. The thermal regulation of the PV/PCM system with a different range of phase transient temperature PCMs has been discussed.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Nuclear engineering; Materials science; Thermal; Energy conversion efficiency; Transient (oscillation); Photovoltaic system; Computer simulation; Heat transfer; Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2010.11.032,journal article,Belfast School of Architecture & the Be,gb

While new buildings are the most frequent subjects of aggressive performance goals like zero net energy (ZNE), the conversion of existing buildings to enhanced efficiency presents a far greater opportunity to recast the sustainability of the built environment. Yet achieving zero net energy in existing buildings is far more formidable than the abundant challenge presented by new buildings. The practices utilized in accomplishing these facade upgrades will determine whether they are a net benefit or just another burden to the economy, society, and environment. This paper explores the potential of curtainwall technology to contribute to the pursuit of zero net energy performance. Curtainwall systems and renovation practices are examined from the standpoint of energy performance and other sustainability considerations. A ZNE-ready facade strategy is proposed. The conclusions recommend an incremental approach to transformation of the building stock towards zero net energy goals facilitated by the application of adaptive curtainwall technology on both new and existing buildings.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Built environment; Architectural engineering; Zero-energy building; Efficient energy use; Retrofitting; Facade; Deep energy retrofit; Sustainability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2015.06.061,journal article,"Advanced Technology Studio–Enclos, 1035 S Grand Ave Ste 101, Los Angeles, CA 90015",us

The initial objectives of the ENERPOS project were : - to develop new methods and tools for the design of net zero energy buildings in hot/tropical climates; - to point out that the factor 3 is easy to meet. The energy index must be below 55 kWhe/m².year (net floor area); - to gather the world of research and the professional sector for improving the use of new simulation tools; - to do a transfer of knowledge from research to the professional fields once the proposed method validated.

All locations were analysed considering the local climate in the context of building performance simulation as well as electricity production. The obtained results allowed for the determination of the risk of overheating, which can influence system durability, accelerated thermal ageing, and overall performance. It was revealed that the risk of overheating above 80 °C is possible in almost all locations; however, the intensity considerably differs between southern and northern Europe. The effect of latent heat storage for better thermal stabilization and overall performance was determined numerically for all locations.

Door-to-door and pneumatic collection are two systems that represent a way of arranging waste collection in city´s historic areas in Spain where conventional street-side container collection is not feasible. Since door-to-door collection generates significant direct greenhouse gas emissions from trucks, pneumatic collection emerges as an alternative to the trucking system. While this technology apparently reduces local direct air emissions, it suffers from a large energy demand derived from vacuum production for waste suction. The introduction of new normative frameworks regarding the selective collection of the biodegradable fraction makes necessary a comprehensive analysis to assess the influence of this fraction collection and its subsequent recycling by anaerobic digestion. As a novelty, this work compares both conventional door-to-door and pneumatic collection systems from a life cycle approach focusing on the biodegradable waste. Results indicate that, in spite of the fact electricity production and consumption have a significant influence on the results, the energy savings from the recycling of the organic fraction are higher than the energy requirements. Therefore, the pneumatic collection could be an environmentally-friendly option for MSW management under a circular economy approach in Spanish city´s historic areas, since wastes could be a material or energy source opportunity.",Biodegradable waste; Circular economy; Life-cycle assessment; Energy source; Environmental science; Greenhouse gas; Waste collection; Waste management; Sustainability; Municipal solid waste,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12071407,journal article,University of Cantabria,es

Thousands of electricity generators have been installed in this process around the world. However, very few countries have technical regulations that enable the energy efficiency and yield to be optimised in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). On the other hand, all these normative should be a result of a serious study of the solar resource available in each region. This paper proposes a methodology to establish technical standards in order to limit the losses due to shading and orientation of the constructed surface areas, where any country could be taken as benchmark.

The proposed methodology covers the development of a new model that allows the irradiation factor (IF) to be estimated on facades with only 2 input parameters: the latitude of the place and the azimuth angle of the photovoltaic generator.

Solar radiation models for urban environments require the characterization of the obstruction degree to which each point is subjected due to other buildings, topography, vegetation, etc. This characterization is carried out with the parameter known as sky view factor (SVF). In this paper, we check that significant disagreements exist in the literature with respect to the definition of SVF. Most published methods show that SVF admits a geometric interpretation as a ratio of projected sky surface versus the global surface of the sky vault projected on the same system. Nevertheless, the type of projection depends only on the authors’ considerations. The geometric comparison of the methods opens a new way to explain their differences.

The accumulated experience in these fields has brought as a consequence the possibility of using laser technology to produce new Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) products with a high degree of customization. However, to produce efficiently these personalized products it is necessary the development of optimized laser processes able to transform standard products in customized items oriented to the BIPV market. In particular, the production of semitransparencies and/or freeform geometries in TF a-Si modules and standard c-Si modules is an application of great interest in this market.

In order to improve the performances of DSCs and to increase their commercial attractiveness, cheap, colourful, stable and highly efficient ruthenium-free dyes must be developed. Here we report the synthesis and complete characterization of a new purely organic sensitizer (RK1) that can be prepared and synthetically upscaled rapidly. Solar cells containing this orange dye show a power conversion efficiency of 10.2% under standard conditions (AM 1.5G, 1000 Wm−2) using iodine/iodide as the electrolyte redox shuttle in the electrolyte, which is among the few examples of DSC using an organic dyes and iodine/iodide red/ox pair to overcome the 10% efficiency barrier. We demonstrate that the combination of this dye with an ionic liquid electrolyte allows the fabrication of solar cells that show power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.36% that are highly stable with no measurable degradation of initial performances after 2200 h of light soaking at 65°C under standard irradiation conditions.

The aim of the work is to investigate the physical mechanisms which influences the thermal behaviour of a double-skin photovoltaic (PV) facade. This results in a better understanding of the related phenomena and infers useful engineering information for controlling the energy transfers to the building where the PV system is applied. In real applications, the PV integrated double facade allows local production of electricity and heat to be employed for the building needs. Furthermore increasing the heat transfer rate from the PV surfaces increases the conversion efficiency of the PV modules since they operate better as the working temperature is lower. The test section consists in a double vertical wall, 2 m high, and each wall is constituted by 10 different heating modules 0.2 m high. The separating distance between the walls is varied from 0.03 to 0.16 m, and the convective heat flux at the wall ranges from 75 to 200 W/m. In this study, the heated section is 1.6 m in height. Different heating configurations are analysed, including the uniform heating mode and two different configurations of non uniform, alternate heating. The experimental procedure allows the wall temperature and local heat transfer coefficient to be inferred and shows that the proper selection of the separating distance and heating mode can noticeably decrease the surface temperatures and hence enhance the conversion efficiency of PV modules",Convection; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Thermal; Heat transfer coefficient; Convective heat transfer; Photovoltaic system; Heat transfer; Natural convection; Mechanics; Thermodynamics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/theta.2007.363422,conference article,Institut national des sciences Appliquées de Lyon,fr

Our aim is to compare their performances by analysing a selection of cryptographic protocols using XOR and DH. We compare execution time and memory consumption for different versions of the following tools OFMC, CL-Atse, Scyther, Tamarin, TA4SP, and extensions of ProVerif (XOR-ProVerif and DH-ProVerif ). Our evaluation shows that in most of the cases the new versions of the tools are faster but consume more memory. We also show how the new tools: Tamarin, Scyther and TA4SP, can be compared to previous ones. We also discover and understand for the protocol IKEv2-DS a difference of modelling by the authors of different tools, which leads to different security results.

Such an arrangement exploits the heat transfer between cavity air, the PV facade and the primary wall of the building for the purpose of PV cooling in summer (with natural convection) and heat recovery in winter (mechanical ventilation). A simplified physical model of the system is proposed for the summer operating configuration, which is more challenging from a numerical perspective. The model describes the active envelop in terms of a simplified geometry, and includes parameters such as density of PV cells, relative coverage of degree of transparency/opaque surfaces, and the ratio of height/width of the double-skin. For a given set of meteorological conditions, the surface and air temperatures, mass flow rate and PV power output are obtained by solving a system of thermal and aerodynamic balance equations. Validation of the model was undertaken using experimental data from a full scale prototype system installed in Toulouse, France as part of the RESSOURCES project (ANR-PREBAT2007). Coupling of the system to a simulated building was achieved with the aid of TRNSYS, and this combined system was evaluated in terms of heating and cooling needs for a range of French climates. It was found that the cooling needs are marginally higher for all locations considered, whereas the impact of the facade on the heating needs is weak as these needs are already low for these all locations.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Heat recovery ventilation; Engineering; Efficient energy use; Double-skin facade; TRNSYS; Facade; Photovoltaic system; Heat transfer; Structural engineering; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.10.016,journal article,Institut national des sciences Appliquées de Lyon,fr

The two sites was equipped with an innovative unglazed PV-T collector, the DualSun technology. With 9m 2 of DualSun collectors, hot water needs for 4 people were 91% covered from May to September, with an average annual coverage of 50%.

The scope of this study is to show how PV is integrated in the BPC buildings’ design process, and what can be learned for future PV applications. The study draws directly from the design decision making sources, investigating on the concerns and suggestions of the BPCA director of sustainability and the BPC architects and PV installers. It attempts to contrast a theoretical approach that sees PV as a technology to domesticate in architecture and bring, through grounded research, PV industry closer to the architectural design process. The findings of the study suggest that while stringent environmental mandates help, in the short term, to kick-start the use of PV systems in buildings, it is the recognition of the PV’s primary role as energy provider, its assimilation in the building industry, and its use in a less confining building program that allows for its evolution in architecture.",Architecture; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Mandate; Scope (project management); Photovoltaic system; Process (engineering); Design process; Sustainability,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings3020341,journal article,University of Lincoln,gb
902,001-066-925-158-474,Tilt Angle Optimization and Passive Cooling of Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPVs) for Better Electrical Performance,2014,"Building-integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPVs) are one of the fastest growing technologies of the renewable energy industry. Numerous attempts are made worldwide for the widespread application of these multifunctional and environmentally friendly systems. A barrier to fulfil this objective is the uncontrolled operating temperatures of BIPVs. The operating temperature of a photovoltaic module or system is a crucial parameter, which has a great influence on the system efficiency and the output energy. For better electrical output from a BIPV, the operating temperature of modules needs to be kept as low as possible. In this respect, tilt angle optimization and cost-effective passive cooling arrangements are investigated within the scope of this paper. In most cases, BIPVs are installed in parallel with the facade; however, the tilt angle impact on module temperature might be significant and hence is investigated for five different values of tilt angle (θ = 0°, 15°, 30°, 45° and 60°). The effects of passive cooling on module temperature of BIPVs are also evaluated for three different fin configurations (rectangular, pin and trapezoidal fin). The paper is based on a CFD methodology. The results are compared with a previously published theoretical work, and an excellent agreement is observed. Five different photovoltaic cell technologies (TF-Si, c-Si, CIGS, CdTe and a-Si) are evaluated in terms of the enhancement in power output. It is observed from the CFD results that the minimum operating temperature of BIPVs is obtained for θ =15°, whereas the maximum temperature is seen at θ = 60°. The results also indicate that more than 5 % enhancement in maximum power output can be obtained for TF-Si-based BIPVs at standard test conditions.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Maximum power principle; Fin (extended surface); Engineering; Operating temperature; Renewable energy; Electronic engineering; Tilt (optics); Photovoltaic system; Mechanical engineering; Passive cooling,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13369-014-1394-y,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb

906,003-011-245-432-876,Investigation of the role of cavity airflow on the performance of building-integrated photovoltaic panels,2014,"Abstract Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels are emerging as a useful technology for helping to achieve net-zero energy buildings. At this time, the main drawback with BIPV systems is the cost per kilowatt per hour of electricity generated. Besides cheaper production of photovoltaic panels, increases in their efficiency can be obtained by reducing panel temperatures. This is often achieved by adding a cavity beneath the panels to allow ventilation of the rear of the panel. However, the details of airflow in the cavity and the effect on cooling have not been rigorously researched. Life-time enhancement against degradation is also an effective technique to reduce the cost of electricity generated. Moisture ingress and thermal stresses are among the primary reasons for degradation of BIPVs; these processes are directly affected by air and moisture flow around the panels. The surface temperature thermography and airflow observations performed in this work helps to understand the transport mechanisms above and below the panels. For this purpose, a novel setup was developed consisting of a building model with a mock BIPV panel plus a solar simulator placed inside an atmospheric wind tunnel. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and infra-red thermography were performed to simultaneously monitor the surface temperature and airflow above and below the panel. The study clearly shows how the accelerated airflow within the cavity increases the heat exchange between the PV and airflow and consequently reduces the PV temperature. It is also shown that the stepped open arrangement of panels is more effective in reducing the temperature comparing to a flat arrangement. This arrangement also has a better resistant against the air and moisture ingress.",Wind tunnel; Heat exchanger; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Airflow; Solar simulator; Thermography; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Cost of electricity by source; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2014.05.003,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb

Comparison is made both to electricity supply from centralised PV plants and to conventional electricity sources. The comparison with conventional sources reveals that there is currently a significant trade-off between the environmental and economic implications of PVs: there are substantial resource benefits to be gained from using PVs to supply electricity, but the economic cost of doing so is significantly higher than conventional sources. This trade-off is reduced when the benefits of building integrated PVs (BiPVs) are considered. By comparison with centralised PV plants, BiPV systems offer the “double dividend” of reduced economic costs and improved environmental performance.

Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is a promising technology capable of producing clean electricity onsite and replacing conventional building materials. This paper designs and investigates the performance of a planar Lambertian reflector-based concentrating BIPV system. A comprehensive 3D ray-tracing simulation was applied to study the optical characteristics of the proposed module. It was found that when the geometric concentration ratio is 2.0, the optical efficiency of the investigated Concentrating Photovoltaics (CPV) module is 62.5% and the radiant flux received by the solar cells is about 1.4 times that of the counterpart module without solar concentrators. Through parametric analyses, it was concluded that the optical performance can be enhanced by selecting a suitable glass thickness and type, integrating the glazing cover with edge mirrors, adjusting the distance between the solar cells and improving the reflectivity of the Lambertian reflectors.

Although there are a growing number of academic articles and demonstration projects showcasing their achievements, the overview of current status and development trend are missing. It is difficult for policymakers, the public and fellow researchers to understand the evolution of modular facade retrofit technologies and who are the important players in the field. As a part of the ongoing European Commission Horizon 2020 project team, the authors decided to write this review article that meets the above needs. Due to the lack of clarification in previous studies, this article firstly introduced and defined the term of Modular Facade Retrofit with Renewable energy technologies (MFRRn), then provided its classification and the review of recent evolution. The MFRRn refer to the retrofitting process that thermal insulation, solar and wind harvest technologies are integrated with the exterior finish of building using modular approach. According to our definition, the MFRRn should fulfil four basic aspects: work to be conducted on existing buildings, work to be undertaken on the facade, using a modular approach, and integrating renewable energy technologies during the retrofit. This study then reviewed 173 research projects funded under the European Commission the seventh Framework, the Horizon 2020′s Energy Efficient Buildings programme, the International Energy Agency Energy in Buildings and Communities (IEA EBC) Annex 50 ‘Prefab Systems for Low Energy/High Comfort Building Renewal’ project, the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action TU1403 ‘Adaptive facades network’. The review shows that at least 14 European Commission research projects and 4 case studies mentioned in COST TU1403 and IEA Annex 50 have involved in certain of level of MFRRn development.

The energy analysis determined that the system paid back its embodied energy in just 4.5 years. Environmental LCA revealed that over the lifetime of the BIPV system the impacts from production were offset by the electricity generated (the avoided impacts) to provide a net environmental benefit. The financial analysis considered the householder's perspective, in contrast to the cost-benefit analysis, which considered a societal perspective. The results of both indicated that under current market conditions the system failed to pay back its initial investment over the 25 year lifetime. However it was predicted that with sustained market growth BIPV could become economically viable by the year 2019. If realised BIPV would offer an attractive option to assist the UK's anticipated (mandatory) zero carbon homes by the year 2016.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Cost–benefit analysis; Financial analysis; Environmental economics; Economic forecasting; Embodied energy; Electricity; Life-cycle assessment; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/supergen.2009.5348173,conference article,University of Bath,gb
911,007-821-486-926-834,Lighting Performance in Office Buildings with Bipv Facades: Visual and Non-Visual Effects,2016,"BIPV facades (integrated with opaque or transparent PV panels) have been accepted as an innovative strategy to provide electricity, reduce peak electrical and cooling demands, improve daylighting utilization, and achieve energy efficiency in buildings. This study presents a preliminary simulation study of impact of BIPV facades on visual and non-visual effects of daylight in an office building. DAYSIM and EVALGLARE, two advanced packages, were used to evaluate daylighting and visual performances. In general lighting and visual conditions can be expressed by the calculated Daylight Autonomy (DA) across the working plane and Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) at vertical planes of specific positions. The non-visual effect of lighting was indicated by the vertical DA at the same vertical positions. It has been found that BIPV facade configurations obviously affect both visual and non-visual performances of daylight. A balance of proper daylighting conditions and visual comfort should be a critical issue in the process of an office facade design.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Daylighting; Daylight; Architectural engineering; Electricity; Efficient energy use; Facade; Glare (vision); Computer science,http://dx.doi.org/10.18086/swc.2015.08.11,conference article,University of Sheffield,gb
912,009-283-919-221-037,"Outdoor organic photovoltaic module characteristics: Benchmarking against other PV technologies for performance, calculation of Ross coefficient and outdoor stability monitoring",2018,"Abstract A comparison of performance parameters for first, second and third generation PV technologies has been conducted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules displayed markedly different outdoor performance characteristics to other PV technologies owing to the positive temperature coefficient, lower thermal mass and response under low light conditions. The linear relationship between irradiance and module temperature rise above ambient is studied, leading to calculation of values for the Ross coefficient for OPV modules. OPVs are shown to possess a lower Ross coefficient than poly-Si, due to the lower absorption of infrared radiation. The effect of wind speed on the Ross coefficient is also investigated, showing the effect that module structure has upon outdoor PV performance, with the OPV module cooling quicker under windy conditions than the poly-Si due to a lower thermal mass. A long term stability study on OPV modules with a silver nanowire-zinc oxide (AgNW-ZnO) composite front electrode has showed two phases of degradation: a short initial burn-in with significant drops in performance; followed by stabilisation and degradation progressing at a much slower rate. During the burn-in period the modules showed diurnal reversible degradation in the short circuit current (ISC), whereas open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) show a steady decline. The reversible degradation is assumed to be related to the desorption of oxygen from the ZnO layer during the day due to UV excitation, leading to an increase in trap formation and a drop in current generation capacity, followed by re-adsorption of the oxygen overnight.",Thermal mass; Degradation (geology); Temperature coefficient; Materials science; Photovoltaic system; Irradiance; Optoelectronics; Open-circuit voltage; Absorption (electromagnetic radiation); Short circuit,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2017.10.008,journal article,Bangor University,gb

The RACPC aims at addressing the following objectives: (i) to increase the electrical output of a concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) system by providing sufficient concentration gain; (ii) to minimise the usage of the PV material with the corresponding reduction of CPV system cost, and (iii) to eliminate the requirement of mechanical tracking by providing a wide field-of-view. This paper first provides a short review on variations of compound parabolic concentrator designs available to date. Next, the process of designing the RACPC is presented and the geometrical concentration gain of the concentrator is discussed. In addition, the optical concentration gain is also presented for various angles of incidence. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that the RACPC can provide significant optical concentration gains within its designed acceptance angle.

An energy analysis for determining the performance of a BIPV Trombe wall integrated to the facade of a room has been carried out. The analysis is based on transient condition. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to predict the temperature and velocity distribution in the test room model. The simulations for two-dimensional model of BIPV Trombe wall system have been carried out for February 4–7th, 2008. The temperature and velocity distribution of the BIPV Trombe wall system are obtained from the simulation results. The simulation results and the measured values of surface temperatures of PV module and thermal wall; indoor, inter-space, inlet and outlet air temperatures have been compared and it is seen that they are in good agreement. The experimental results also show that 10% of solar radiation transmittance has been supplied by using a semi-transparent a-Si solar cell. Thus, thermal energy input to the system increases compared to other BIPV systems. Meanwhile, the experimental daily average electrical and thermal efficiency of this system can reach 4.52% and 27.2% respectively.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Thermal; Natural ventilation; Trombe wall; Solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Thermal efficiency; Structural engineering; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.06.031,journal article,Energy Institute,gb

Available from the publisher via the DOI in this record.Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is a promising solar energy technology that looks set to grow in popularity in the pursuit of a sustainable future. It has the potential to mitigate some of the main concerns over ground-mounted solar energy systems such as land use. However, there is an apparent gap in our understanding of its life cycle environmental impacts. Very few life cycle analysis (LCA) studies have evaluated BIPV comprehensively in comparison with standalone PV systems and other energy technologies. In this paper, we review the limited existing LCA studies on BIPV and identify the challenges and future research needs. The findings will help researchers, industries and policy makers better understand the environmental sustainability of BIPV to facilitate its development.Innovate U",Engineering; Architectural engineering; Research needs; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Sustainability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/556/1/012053,journal article,University of Exeter,gb

Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70, BiP. These were found to consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, attenuating the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, pointing to the relative inertness of the oligomers. Thus, equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale attainable neither by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP nor by the conventional unfolded protein response.",Binding site; Biophysics; Unfolded protein response; Endoplasmic reticulum; Protomer; Monomer; Linker; Chaperone (protein); Plasma protein binding; Biochemistry; Biology,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.08961,journal article,University of Cambridge,gb
917,012-564-958-307-510,Progress of solar photovoltaic in ASEAN countries: A review,2015,"The present global energy scenario, in which fossil fuels play a preponderant role, faces significant energy and environmental challenges. To help address these challenges, countries across the world are increasing the contribution made by renewable energy (RE) resources to their energy supplies. Feed-in Tariff (FiT) is one of the most effective incentive policies used to promote the RE sector especially at the micro-generation level. The key objective of the FiT schemes is to provide financial support to residential, industrial and commercial consumers to encourage them to become RE producers. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most promising RE technologies. This paper provides an overview of the solar PV developments in the Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries. It reflects upon the RE trends in the world as well as providing an introduction to the ASEAN countries. It reviews the progress of solar PV in each of the ASEAN countries especially in terms of RE policies, growth in terms of PV installations and research and development activities. Finally, the paper presents conclusions and a set of recommendations. Out of the 10 ASEAN countries, 5 have implemented FiT as a key policy incentive to stimulate the progress of RE. It is found that the ASEAN countries have great potential for solar PV in term of their annual solar insolation levels, which ranging from 1460 to 1892 kWh/m2 per year.",Feed-in tariff; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; International economics; Renewable energy; Tariff; Incentive; Photovoltaic system; Operations research; Solar energy; Fossil fuel,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.010,journal article,Glasgow Caledonian University,gb
918,012-627-371-714-729,Performance Characterisation and Optimisation of a Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) System in a Maritime Climate,2019,"A seasonal analysis of a long-term dataset produced by an off-grid classroom facility showcasing several solar orientated renewable technologies is presented. The performance of the building’s BIPV and battery storage system is characterised and optimisation strategies are discussed. The building experiences a typical oceanic climate defined by a relatively narrow annual temperature range and a high level of annual precipitation, resulting in significant fluctuation in PV performance throughout the year. On clear days, the battery system reaches capacity quickly and PV power output drops to the base load of the building. This curtailment of solar generation highlights the importance of developing control strategies to optimise system performance. Maximising the performance of the building requires accurate methodologies for predicting PV generation and detailed knowledge of building demand profiles. Significant correlation is observed between the solar irradiance, battery state of charge and PV power output, demonstrating the importance of these variables in any solar forecasting model. Demand profiles are deterministic and follow classroom routine. A baseline accounts for persistent systems such as the building management system that are active throughout the day, with demand peaking during occupancy. This information could be incorporated into scheduling algorithms to optimise performance. Consumption is more aligned with the solar generation profile than typical residential buildings that peak in the evening as levels of solar generation fall. The synergistic effect of buildings with different demand profiles could be a mitigation method to minimise the temporal mismatch between solar generation and consumption.",Building management system; Baseline (configuration management); Building-integrated photovoltaics; Base load power plant; Occupancy; Automotive engineering; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/fce.62,journal article,Swansea University,gb
919,012-866-647-847-249,Development and validation of an intelligent algorithm for synchronizing a low-environmental-impact electricity supply with a building’s electricity consumption,2018,"Standard algorithm of building’s energy strategy often use electricity and its tariff as the sole criterion of choice. This paper introduced an algorithmic regulation using global warming potential (GWP) of energy flux, to select which installation will satisfy the building energy demand (BED). In the frame of the Correlation Carbon project conducted by the Smart Living Lab (SLL), a research center dedicated to the building of the future, this paper presents the algorithm behind the design, the selection and the operation of appropriate energy installations for low-carbon buildings. The control strategy governing the building’s energy flow takes into account demand, supply and storage. The latter being mainly linked to economic or energy benefits, which standard algorithms often use as the only criterion of choice, thus increasing the environmental impact of the energy flowing through the building. In contrast to those, the algorithm introduced in this paper controls the energy fluxes of the electrical grid, photovoltaic (PV) panels, static and vehicle batteries according to their GWP. A simulation over one year at an hourly time step – enabling one to take into account small but significant variations of the GWP of the electricity from grid – is presented for different scenarios, in order to draw an annual balance for a given combination of energy systems. The algorithm chooses the “cleanest” instantaneous energy source combination to meet the BED. Simulations show that a building using this algorithm can satisfy its BED while reducing its GWP by as much as 40% compared to an energy supply using the grid only.",Algorithm; Mains electricity; Grid; Electricity; Energy flow; Energy supply; Electrical grid; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Energy flux,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/168/1/012002,conference article,Energy Institute,gb
920,013-514-931-887-114,Infusing Technology Into Perinatal Home Visitation in the United States for Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence: Exploring the Interpretive Flexibility of an mHealth Intervention.,2016,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common during pregnancy and the postpartum. Perinatal home visitation provides favorable conditions in which to identify and support women affected by IPV. However, the use of mHealth for delivering IPV interventions in perinatal home visiting has not been explored. Objective: Our objective was to conduct a nested qualitative interpretive study to explore perinatal home visitors’ and women’s perceptions and experiences of the Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program (DOVE) using mHealth technology (ie, a computer tablet) or a home visitor-administered, paper-based method. Methods: We used purposive sampling, using maximum variation, to select women enrolled in a US-based randomized controlled trial of the DOVE intervention for semistructured interviews. Selection criteria were discussed with the trial research team and 32 women were invited to participate. We invited 45 home visitors at the 8 study sites to participate in an interview, along with the 2 DOVE program designers. Nonparticipant observations of home visits with trial participants who chose not to participate in semistructured interviews were undertaken. Results: We conducted 51 interviews with 26 women, 23 home visiting staff at rural and urban sites, and the 2 DOVE program designers. We conducted 4 nonparticipant observations. Among 18 IPV-positive women, 7 used the computer tablet and 11 used the home visitor method. Among 8 IPV-negative women, 7 used the home visitor method. The computer tablet was viewed as a safe and confidential way for abused women to disclose their experiences without fear of being judged. The meanings that the DOVE technology held for home visitors and women led to its construction as either an impersonal artifact that was an impediment to discussion of IPV or a conduit through which interpersonal connection could be deepened, thereby facilitating discussion about IPV. Women’s and home visitors’ comfort with either method of screening was positively influenced by factors such as having established trust and rapport, as well as good interpersonal communication. The technology helped reduce the anticipated stigma associated with disclosing abuse. The didactic intervention video was a limiting feature, as the content could not be tailored to accommodate the fluidity of women’s circumstances. Conclusions: Users and developers of technology-based IPV interventions need to consider the context in which they are being embedded and the importance of the patient-provider relationship in promoting behavior change in order to realize the full benefits. An mHealth approach can and should be used as a tool for initiating discussion about IPV, assisting women in enhancing their safety and exploring help-seeking options. However, training for home visitors is required to ensure that a computer tablet is used to complement and enhance the therapeutic relationship.

This paper presents a dynamic PV temperature prediction model based on transient Energy Balance Equations, incorporating theoretical expressions for all heat transfer processes, natural convection, forced convection, conduction and radiation exchanges between both module sides and the environment. The algorithmic approach predicts PV temperature at the centre of the cell, the back and the front glass cover with fast convergence and serves the PV power output prediction. The simulation model is robust, predicting PV temperature with high accuracy at any environmental conditions, PV inclination, orientation, wind speed and direction, and mounting configurations, free-standing and BIPV. These, alongside its theoretical basis, ensure the model’s wide applicability and clear advantage over existing PV temperature prediction models. The model is validated for a wide range of environmental conditions, PV geometries and mounting configurations with experimental data from a sun-tracking, a fixed angle PV and a BIPV system. The deviation between predicted and measured power output for the fixed-angle and the sun-tracking PV systems was estimated at −1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. The median of the temperature difference between predicted and measured values was as low as 0.5 °C for the sun-tracking system, and for all cases, the predicted temperature profiles were closely matching the measured profiles. The PV temperature and power output predicted by this model are compared to the results produced by other well-known PV temperature models, illustrating its high predictive capacity, accuracy and robustness.",Smart grid; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Wind speed; Thermal conduction; Forced convection; Transient (oscillation); Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Heat transfer; Control theory,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13184743,journal article,University of East Anglia,gb

The PV cells are mounted on the south facade and on the roof of the SIECT in the Giheung area. Special care was taken in the building design to have the PV modules shade the building in the summer, so as to reduce cooling loads, while at the same time allowing solar energy to enter the building during the heating season, and providing daylight. This paper gives a 1 year analysis of the system performance, evaluation of the system efficiency and the power output, taking into account the weather conditions. As a part of certain design compromises, that took into account, aesthetic, safety, and cost considerations, non-optimal tilt angles and occasional shading of the PV modules made the efficiency of PV system lower than the peak rating of the cells. The yearly average efficiency of the sunshade solar panel is 9.2% (average over 28.6°C surface temperature), with a minimum of 3.6% (average over 27.9°C surface temperature) in June and a maximum of 20.2% (average over 19.5°C surface temperature) in December.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Daylight; Automotive engineering; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Roof; Facade; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Simulation; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0360-1323(01)00071-3,journal article,Sehan University,gb

One important part of the latter procedure is to obtain the so-called ‘view factor’ of the emitter–receiver combination. The principal aim of this article is to present finite-element based procedures to obtain view factor with good time efficiency. As such routines presented here compute the view factor between a non-uniform emitter field and the receiving surface. An example of this is ground-reflected solar radiation to thermal or photovoltaic collectors, the foreground itself being composed of surfaces that have wide-ranging reflectivities. Four routines have been presented here: one based on a uniform grid for emitting and receiving surfaces using a brute force approach (Uniform Populous Grid (UPG)), and another that used non-uniform grid for the receiving surface, where cells’ sizes increased in arithmetic progression as one withdraws from the common edge (Non Uniform Grid Populous (NUGP)). The last two routines used combinations of the first two approaches with Monte-Carlo approach (Uniform Grid Monte-Carlo (UGMC) and Non Uniform Grid Monte-Carlo (NUGMC)). It was found that the NUGP algorithm was the most efficient to reduce the calculation error for the same number of computations, it was about 450 times (430 for non-uniform reflectivity) more accurate than UPG, 160 (125) times more than UGMC and 70 (60) times more than NUGMC.

An MPPT algorithm featuring rapid convergence and steady-state accuracy is described. The power tracking performance of the proposed MPPT converter has been experimentally verified. The experimental test rig consists of a 65 W multi-crystalline PV panel with controllable illumination to emulate the changes of solar irradiance. The test rig is fitted with a FPGA-DSP controlled rapid prototyping platform for power conditioning. The current-mode control method provides better transient performance than directly perturb the duty-cycle of the converter. A step-size varies in response to the former approach and previous error ensures rapid accurate tracking following shadow effects of clouds or obstructions. The experimental results show that the proposed MPPT converter is capable of reaching the steady-state condition quickly during a transient with negligible oscillations and tracking under dynamic changes of solar irradiance efficiently.,Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Switched-mode power supply; Power (physics); Electronic engineering; Transient (oscillation); Maximum power point tracking; Photovoltaic system; Tracking (particle physics); Control theory; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/epe.2007.4417326,conference article,Imperial College London,gb

The effect of CPC truncation and V-trough side wall angles were studied. The truncated CPC demonstrated much improved light acceptance outside the designed angle of acceptance when compared to the original CPC design and V-trough-like characteristics past the original design acceptance angles, consequently reducing material consumption for the manufacture of truncated CPC and therefore reduction in the cost of the system. Truncated CPCs showed optical efficiency equal to their full height counterparts, but a lower concentration ratio (4 at full, 3.6 at half and 2.7 at 50 mm height) due to an equivalent reduction of the inlet aperture size. The V-trough had a higher optical concentration ratio over 15–30° angle of incidents (AoI), with the CPC taking over from 30° AoI upwards. Experiments were performed on a 50 mm truncated CPC and a 22° Trough Wall Angle (TWA) V-trough collector under outdoor conditions. Experimentally measured data showed good correlation with ray tracing simulation results.

931,018-728-674-058-491,Review on recent approaches for hybrid PV/T solar technology,2016,"Summary; This paper reviews the recent hybrid photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) structural/geometrical topologies to highlight the state of the art on this form of collector approaches and designs for both liquid and air-based systems. The review focuses on the development of the typical flat-plate collector – as an essential part in the PV/T system – in terms of new concept and novel configurations and specifically on the design of these collectors that use air or liquid as a heat transfer medium and their ability to extract useful heat from the back surface of the PV panel. Different mechanisms of fluid flow either natural or forced are considered. Many different design configurations for hybrid PV/T collectors have been cataloged and evaluated. It is shown that at least 30 distinct configurations have been introduced in the literature in the last 5 years. The paper concludes with identifying the major factors that affect the performance of typical PV/T systems and lead to effective enhancement of the heat removal mechanisms thus improving the electrical and thermal solar conversion efficiencies. This paper should serve as a significant form of reference for any future development in the design of the PV/T concept.

Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has the potential to provide significant energy generation by utilising the existing building infrastructure as a power generator, engendering a transformation shift from traditional energy sources. This research presents an innovative study on the industrial viability of utilising “rough” low carbon steel integrated with an Intermediate Layer (IL) to develop lower cost thin film BIPV products and is compared to existing commercial products. Consideration of the final product cost is given and potential business models to enter the BIPV are identified. The lab scale and upscaling elements of the research support the significant benefits of an approach that extends beyond the use of expensive solar grade steel. A state-of-the-art review of existing steel-based BIPV products is given and used as a benchmark to compare the new products. The results demonstrate that a competitively commercial product is viable and also highlight the strong potential for the adoption of a “rough” steel + IL focused approach to BIPV manufacture and a potential new direction to develop cost efficiencies in an increasingly competitive market.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Cost efficiency; Manufacturing engineering; Renewable energy; Energy source; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.119,journal article,Swansea University,gb
933,020-574-866-642-695,Assessing the technical and economic performance of building integrated photovoltaics and their value to the GCC society,2013,"Abstract This paper assesses the technical and economic performance of PV technology integrated into residential buildings in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It highlights the value of PV electricity for the GCC society from the perspective of consumers, utilities and environment. Through a systematic modelling analysis it is shown that the efficiency of PV system drops by 4–6% due to high range of module temperature and also a change in power output due to high ambient temperatures. Consequently, the outputs of horizontal and vertical PV modules are found to be less than estimates based on standard test conditions. Economically, this study shows that building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are not viable in GCC countries and cannot compete with conventional electricity sources on a unit cost basis. From a society point of view, however, the integration of PV technology into buildings would have several benefits for the GCC countries, including: first, savings in capital cost due to central power plants and transmission and distribution processes; second, an increase in the exported oil and natural gas used for electricity generation; and third, a reduction in the CO 2 emissions from conventional power plants. When these considerations are taken into account then BIPV should become a feasible technology in GCC countries.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Environmental economics; Economy; Capital cost; Electricity; Distribution (economics); Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Horizontal and vertical; Unit cost,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.11.034,journal article,University of Liverpool,gb

Energy models rely on predictive indicators and assumptions that are usually done at the design stage, without acknowledging behavioral patterns of actual users, amongst other uncertain elements. Moreover, in the context of the performance gap, it is evident that energy efficiency is overemphasized while other key issues such as health and comfort of occupants associated with indoor air quality, noise levels etc., have been less stressed and discussed. This paper discusses physical measurements of indoor temperature in a case study building at the University of Cambridge and reports findings of a workshop with researchers, building professionals and graduate students working on environmental performance in the built environment. The workshop addressed research issues related to energy, comfort and health (couched in terms of thermal performance), used as a means to understand the complexities of and trade-off between different aspects of sustainable buildings. Retrofit measures were suggested while considering how to balance energy and comfort needs, with some these measures being modelled to determine their efficacy.

One way to reduce building energy consumption is to adopt energy efficiency technologies and strategies. Due to environmental concerns and high cost of energy in recent years there has been a renewed interest in building energy efficiency and integration of renewable energy technologies. Active building envelope technology, i.e. transpired solar collectors (TSCs), provides a cost-efficient way of minimizing energy demand of buildings in accordance with global principle of sustainability, which has also proven reliable for diverse applications such as preheating fresh air delivery into the buildings and supplying domestic hot water in summer etc. The objective of this paper is to review the heat transfer and energy flow characteristics of the active building envelopes, particularly focusing on various types of TSCs. Present work consists of background and concept of TSCs, research literature for thermal performance, theoretical modelling, experimental study and numerical simulation investigation. Diverse mathematical models, including thermal models, air flow models, porosity models, and turbulence models etc., have also been presented and compared. Following that, more than 20 parameters affecting TSC performance have been analyzed and evaluated. The literature has illustrated that the best overall performance of turbulence model is RNG k-e; the effects of those parameters on TSC efficiency are completely different, depending on local climatic conditions, time and site constraints, and the interaction between different factors.",Engineering; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Building envelope; Energy flow; Process engineering; Efficient energy use; Thermal efficiency; Heat transfer; Energy engineering; Building science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.015,journal article,Coventry University,gb

The type of buildings that were considered include medium size houses for up to four people, and buildings for offices/small business and hotels (Greece only). The chosen case studies were considered to be for new or refurbishment buildings, and, in the case of not integrated systems, for existing buildings that have the capacity to incorporate a PV installation on their present structure. The analysis has been done with the aid of PVSYST software. The costs have been derived for a working PV period of 25 years. Apart from that, a forecasting, through sensitivity analysis, of the likely relation between the price of the PV generated electricity and the price of electricity-buying power from the grid has been evaluated, examined, and analysed for the next decade. The main aim was to estimate when the prices of the PV generated electricity would be attractive to the potential costumers. The sensitivity analysis has been focused on different potential scenarios. The results identify that the period in which the profitable installation of a PV system on buildings will be a reality is estimated to be 2007–2011.

937,024-302-093-788-794,Thin Films for Advanced Glazing Applications,2016,"Functional thin films provide many opportunities for advanced glazing systems. This can be achieved by adding additional functionalities such as self-cleaning or power generation, or alternately by providing energy demand reduction through the management or modulation of solar heat gain or blackbody radiation using spectrally selective films or chromogenic materials. Self-cleaning materials have been generating increasing interest for the past two decades. They may be based on hydrophobic or hydrophilic systems and are often inspired by nature, for example hydrophobic systems based on mimicking the lotus leaf. These materials help to maintain the aesthetic properties of the building, help to maintain a comfortable working environment and in the case of photocatalytic materials, may provide external pollutant remediation. Power generation through window coatings is a relatively new idea and is based around the use of semi-transparent solar cells as windows. In this fashion, energy can be generated whilst also absorbing some solar heat. There is also the possibility, in the case of dye sensitized solar cells, to tune the coloration of the window that provides unheralded external aesthetic possibilities. Materials and coatings for energy demand reduction is highly desirable in an increasingly energy intensive world. We discuss new developments with low emissivity coatings as the need to replace scarce indium becomes more apparent. We go on to discuss thermochromic systems based on vanadium dioxide films. Such systems are dynamic in nature and present a more sophisticated and potentially more beneficial approach to reducing energy demand than static systems such as low emissivity and solar control coatings. The ability to be able to tune some of the material parameters in order to optimize the film performance for a given climate provides exciting opportunities for future technologies. In this article, we review recent progress and challenges in these areas and provide a perspective for future trends and developments.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Low emissivity; Nanotechnology; Thin film; Vanadium dioxide; Solar gain; Computer science; Electricity generation; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Glazing,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings6030037,journal article,Queen Mary University of London,gb

In the UK, the carbon intensity of grid electricity is higher during the daytime and over winter. This work investigates whether the grid electricity displaced by PV is high or low carbon compared to the annual mean carbon intensity using carbon factors at higher temporal resolutions (half-hourly and daily). ; ; UK policy for carbon reporting requires savings to be calculated using the annual mean carbon intensity of grid electricity. This work offers an insight into whether this technique is appropriate.; Using half hourly data on the generating plant supplying the grid from November 2008 to May 2010, carbon factors for grid electricity at half-hourly and daily resolution have been derived using technology specific generation emission factors. ; ; Applying these factors to generation data from PV systems installed on schools, it is possible to assess the variation in the carbon savings from displacing grid electricity with PV generation using carbon factors with different time resolutions.; ; The data has been analyzed for a period of 363 to 370 days and so cannot account for inter-year variations in the relationship between PV generation and carbon intensity of the electricity grid. This analysis suggests that PV displaces more carbon intensive electricity using half-hourly carbon factors than using daily factors but less compared with annual ones. ; ; A similar methodology could provide useful insights on other variable renewable and demand-side technologies and in other countries where PV performance and grid behavior are different.",Stand-alone power system; Engineering; Meteorology; Grid parity; Renewable energy; Electricity; Carbon accounting; Photovoltaic system; Carbon; Photovoltaics; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.3384/ecp110572730,conference article,University of Reading,gb

Various studies on GSR had been carried out in Malaysia including Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Kota Bharu at the earlier stage. Afterward, data from the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MET) and the Malaysian National University were used to estimate the monthly average daily global radiation for various locations in Malaysia including Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, Bandar Baru Bangi, Kota Baru, Senai, Bayan Lepas, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. GSR in Putrajaya, a location which has identified to implement Malaysian Building Integrated Photovoltaic (MBIPV) projects has yet to be estimated. The conventional method to obtain the amount of GSR at a location is to install a measuring device like a pyranometer at the site to observe and document its day-to-day recordings. However, this is a time-consuming and costly practice. The models used to estimate the GSR are usually based on astronomical factors, geometrical factors, physical factors and meteorological factors. There are numerous models used to predict GSR which can be categorized based on sunshine, cloud, temperature and other meteorological parameters. Additionally, the global solar energy models can be grouped by its modelling techniques such as linear, nonlinear, artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic modelling techniques. The reviews discovered that the models used to estimate GSR were mostly correlated to sunshine duration (SD), air temperature, relative humidity and geographical parameters like latitude, longitude and altitude. In this paper, the GSR in Putrajaya is estimated from the hourly solar radiation and daily sunshine hours data from the Malaysian Meteorological Department. The data, along with the calculated monthly average daily extraterrestrial radiation on a horizontal surface and monthly average maximum possible daily sunshine is used to plot a scatter graph that is linearly fitted. The gradient and vertical axis cut-off from the linear fit is used to obtain the coefficients in the Angstrom-Prescott (A-P) model. Subsequently, the coefficients were used to estimate the GSR in Putrajaya. In line with the government's initiative, this study will provide an estimation of the GSR in Putrajaya where the finding will be beneficial to the stakeholders, policy maker, developer and investor and energy authority. The average monthly GSR was obtained for nine out of twelve months with highest at 21.18 MJ/m2 in March and lowest at 18.34 MJ/m2 in June.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Latitude; Meteorology; Sunshine duration; Pyranometer; Longitude; Altitude; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/268/1/012056,conference article,Heriot-Watt University,gb

Phase change materials (PCM) can be used to passively limit this temperature rise although their effectiveness is limited by their low thermal conductivities and crystallisation segregation during solidification. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the effects of convection and crystalline segregation in a PCM as a function of efficiency of heat transfer within the finned PV/PCM system.

A new arrival in the family of solar cells technologies is the organic-inorganic halide perovskite. The major thrust for endorsing these new solar cells pertains to their potential as an economically and environmentally viable option to traditional silicon-based technology. To verify this assertion, this paper presents a critical review of some existing photovoltaic (PV) technologies in comparison with perovskite-structured solar cells (PSCs), including material and performance parameters, production processes and manufacturing complexity, economics, key technological challenges for further developments and current research efforts. At present, there is limited environmental assessment of PSCs and consequently, a methodologically robust and environmentally expansive lifecycle supply chain assessment of two types of PSC modules A and B is also undertaken within the context of other PV technologies, to assess their potential for environmentally friendly innovation in the energy sector. Module A is based on MAPbX3 perovskite structure while module B is based on CsFAPbX3 with improved stability, reproducibility and high performance efficiency. The main outcomes, presented along with sensitivity analysis, show that PSCs offer more environmentally friendly and sustainable option, with the least energy payback period, as compared to other PV technologies.

PSC modules displayed markedly different outdoor performance characteristics to other PV technologies owing to the reversible diurnal changes in efficiency, difference in temperature coefficient between absorber layers and response under low light conditions. Examination of diurnal performance parameters on a sunny day showed that whereas the FMC modules maintained their efficiency throughout the day, the MAPI modules peaked in performance during the morning and afternoon, with a strong decrease around midday. Overall, the MAPI modules showed a strongly negative temperature coefficient (TC) for PCE, whereas the FMC modules showed a moderate positive temperature coefficient performance as a function of temperature due to the increase in JSC and FF. Outdoor monitoring of the MAPI modules over several days highlighted that the reduced over the course of the day but recovered overnight.

This work explores the possibility to use commercial ceramic tiles as ecological substrates for Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 (CZTSe) thin film solar cells in view of an application in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). As a novel approach to control the Na-incorporation into the kesterite absorber, the substrates are coated with enamels containing different concentrations of Na 2 O (from 2 to 20% wt.). This way, the enamel becomes not only a smoothing element but also a source of Na during the absorber growth. The impact that an increased Na 2 O content has on the Mo back contact deposited on these enameled ceramic substrates is investigated. 3D optical profilometry shows surfaces with undulations, pinholes and cracks directly related to the Na 2 O content of the enamels. High quality kesterite (Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 ) absorbers with good crystallinity were produced on these substrates by sequential precursor sputtering and selenization. The good performance of first solar cell devices with a maximum efficiency of 7.5% gives a solid proof-of-concept for ceramic solar tiles based on efficient kesterite absorbers.",Ceramic; Composite material; Materials science; Mineralogy; Sputtering; Kesterite; Solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Substrate (electronics); Crystallinity; Vitreous enamel,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2016.04.035,journal article,Adria Airways,gb

Also considered here are the different architectural integration options, which the authors present through a catalogue of possible thermal energy storage locations. This paper also argues that an active storage system provides a means for energy systems in buildings to actively participate in future energy networks, which may require active load management to accommodate a high proportion of renewable technologies.

952,035-366-943-880-338,Experimental Investigation of a Novel Solar Micro-Channel Loop-Heat-Pipe Photovoltaic/Thermal (MC-LHP-PV/T) System for Heat and Power Generation,2019,"Abstract This paper aims to experimentally investigate a novel solar Micro-Channel Loop-Heat-Pipe Photovoltaic/Thermal (MC-LHP-PV/T) system which, making its first attempt to employ the co-axial tubular heat exchanger as the condenser, PV-bound multiple micro-channel tubes array as the PV/evaporator, the upper end liquid header with tiny holes as the liquid header and liquid/vapour separator, and the upper end vapour header as the vapour collector and distributor, can create the improved condensation and evaporation effects within the loop-heat-pipe (LHP) and thus, achieve significantly enhanced solar thermal and electrical efficiencies compared to traditional PV/T systems. Based on the results derived from our previous analytical study, a prototype MC-LHP-PV/T system employing R-134a as the working fluid was designed, constructed and tested, and the testing results were used to evaluate its operational performance including solar thermal and electrical efficiencies and their relevant impact factors. It is found that solar thermal efficiency of the MC-LHP-PV/T system varied with the inlet temperature and flow rate of coolant water, ambient temperature, as well as height difference between the condenser and evaporator. A lower inlet water temperature, a higher water flow rate, a higher ambient temperature, and a larger height difference between the condenser and the evaporator can help increase the solar thermal efficiency of the system. Under a range of testing conditions with the refrigerant charge ratio of 30%, a peak solar thermal efficiency (i.e., 71.67%) happened at solar radiation of 561W/m2, inlet water temperature of 18°C, water flow rate of 0.17m3/h, ambient temperature of 30°C, and height difference of 1.3m. This set of parametrical data is therefore regarded as the optimal operational condition of the MC-LHP-PV/T system. Under these specific operational condition and the real weather solar radiation, the solar thermal efficiency of the system was in the range 25.2% to 62.2%, while the solar electrical efficiency varied from 15.59% to 18.34%. Compared to the existing PV/T and BIPV/T systems, the new MC-LHP-PV/T system achieved 17.20% and 33.31% higher overall solar efficiency.",Heat exchanger; Nuclear engineering; Materials science; Condenser (heat transfer); Loop heat pipe; Water flow; Photovoltaic system; Thermal efficiency; Evaporator; Coolant,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113929,journal article,University of Hull,gb

With intrinsic passive impedance networks as energy sources, these converters are able to achieve voltage boosting with either polarity, leading to improved dc-link voltage utilization compared with the conventional two-level converter. However, HOWO-ISCs suffer from transfer functions giving low bandwidth, a penalty of increased passive devices and right-half-plane zeros, which result in lower order distortion of the ac output power. In this paper, a modified plug-in repetitive control scheme is presented for HOWO-ISCs with accurate reference tracking (hence low distortion), fast dynamic response, and enhanced robustness. By using zero-phase-shift finite impulse response filters in both the internal model of the repetitive controller and its compensation network, the proposed method achieves zero steady-state error and an extended closed-loop bandwidth. For HOWO-ISC cases, this method outperforms conventional proportional-integral (PI) control, which has considerable steady-state error. It also eliminates the need of parallel loops for several frequencies when proportional resonant control or orthogonal transformation-based PI schemes are used to remove lower order distortion. The design process and performance analysis of the proposed repetitive control strategy are based on a novel three-phase HOWO-ISC configuration with a reduced number of switches.

These systems are not only capable of generating electricity, but can also contribute to minimise energy consumption in buildings by providing natural illumination, space and water heating, ventilation and shading. Despite these advantages, one of the issues that still prevents the widespread adoption of BIPV systems is their high capital cost. This paper discusses a novel type of non-imaging optical concentrator that can be used to reduce the capital cost of a BIPV system. This new concentrator, known as rotationally asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (RACPC), has a flat entrance aperture that facilitates integration within a double-glazing window and reduces fabrication costs. The RACPC, which has a geometrical concentration of 3.66x, also offers other advantages over conventional solar concentrators: suitability for fenestration, ease of integration with square PV cells, and passive tracking. Several experiments were carried out on a double-glazing solar window incorporating an array of 4x3 concentrator-PV cells. The experiments were carried out indoors under standard test conditions. The results show that the RACPC-PV window effectively increases the short-circuit current by a factor of over 3 at normal incidence when compared with a non-concentrated solar window.

In addition to architectural changes to the power system, the applications of demand side response (DSR) also add a dimension of complexity — thereby converting the traditionally passive customers into active prosumers (customers that both produce and consume electricity). It has therefore become important to conduct detailed studies on system load profiles to uncover the nature of the system load. These studies could help distribution network operators (DNOs) to adopt relevant strategies that can accommodate new resources such as distributed generation and energy storage on the evolving distribution network and ensure updated design and management approaches. This paper investigates the relationship between both the system load diversity and variability when different customers are aggregated at different scales. Additionally, the implication of sampling time scales is investigated to capture its effect on load diversity and variability. The study looks at the diversity and variability that is observable from the viewpoint of higher power levels, when interconnecting different sized groupings of customers, at different sampling resolutions. The paper thus concludes that the per-customer capacity requirement of the network decreases as the size of customer groupings increases. The load variability also decreases as the aggregation level increases. For active network management, faster time scales are required at lower aggregation scales due to high load variability.",Network planning and design; Distributed computing; Engineering; Renewable energy; Electricity; Active Network Management; Electric power; Distributed generation; Real-time computing; Electric power system; Sampling (statistics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/afrcon.2017.8095675,conference article,University of Oxford,gb

Despite strong promise, LSCs have not yet reached their full potential due to various mechanisms affecting the device's optical efficiency. Among those loss channels, escape cone and non-unity quantum yield losses are generally the most dominant. To further advance the field of LSCs, it is vital to understand the impact of each independently. So far, researchers have only characterized the total loss in LSCs. Here, an experimental method is proposed to separate the contribution from each individual loss channel. The experimental apparatus is the same as used for quantum yield measurements of fluorophores in solid samples. Therefore, the setup is commonly available to research groups already involved in LSC research. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated by comparing the experimental results with Monte-Carlo ray tracing.

In order to minimize the risks of fire accidents in large scale applications of solar panels, this review focuses on the latest techniques for reducing hot spot effects and DC arcs. The risk mitigation solutions mainly focus on two aspects: structure reconfiguration and faulty diagnosis algorithm. The first is to reduce the hot spot effect by adjusting the space between two PV modules in a PV array or relocate some PV modules. The second is to detect the DC arc fault before it causes fire. There are three types of arc detection techniques, including physical analysis, neural network analysis, and wavelet detection analysis. Through these detection methods, the faulty PV cells can be found in a timely manner thereby reducing the risk of PV fire.

They are (i) elliptical entry aperture; (ii) hyperbolic profile section and (iii) square exit aperture. Due to the increasing demands for stationary solar concentrators for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), this new design focuses on the use as a stationary solar concentrator. The complete optical analysis of the concentrator is carried out via 3-D ray trace technique. The analysis is based on all necessary design parameters, i.e., elliptical entry axis, concentrator height and the exit aperture geometry, in order to obtain the optimal overall optical performance of the new 3-D solar concentrator. Four different geometrical low concentration ratios were investigated: 4×, 6×, 8× and 10×. Results of the computer simulation show that the designed concentrator of 4× concentration ratio gives the higher optical efficiency of 68% compared to the other low concentration ratios. The 6×, however, gives a higher optical concentration ratio, despite having a lower optical efficiency (55%) than the 4×. A prototype of the designed concentrator was manufactured and tested under indoors conditions. The experimental results have shown an agreement by a difference of 5% with the simulation results.

Over the last decade, rather than a steady progression along an established learning curve, PV costs and prices have been volatile, with increases or plateaus followed by rapid reductions. The paper describes, and considers the causes of, recent changes in PV costs and prices at module and system level, both international trends and more place-specific contexts. It finds that both module and system costs and price trends have reflected multiple overlapping forces. Established forecasting methods – experience curves and engineering assessments – have limited ability to capture key learning effects behind recent PV cost and price trends: production scale effects, industrial re-organization and shakeouts, international trade practices and national market dynamics.

974,057-914-381-347-752,Energy and economic performance of rooftop PV panels in the hot and dry climate of Iran,2018,"Abstract Photovoltaic (PV) Panels, one of the more promising renewable energy technologies, are growing rapidly nowadays, especially in developed countries. However, these systems have not achieved public acceptance in some countries due to low energy efficiency and poor economic performance, especially in countries which are subsidized in energy tariffs. In this paper, the energy and economic performance of fourteen rooftop PV systems with the power of 5 kW in the hot and dry climate of Iran are assessed by monitoring the total annual energy production and simulation. The monitored data is used to analyze systems’ economic performance via Pay-Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Return of Investment (ROI) and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Results show that single array configuration systems have the maximum energy production while dividing the system decreases the production. Economic analysis shows that the average PBP is 11.6 years under actual price of electricity (0.21$), however it is 46.9–50.5 years under subsidized average tariffs. ROI values range from 2.6 to 3.2 with the average of 2.9 for actual prices. Under subsidized prices, the cash generated by investment cannot even offset the costs that the investment requires during its lifetime with NCF and NPV being both negative. Overall, the systems are not economically beneficial under subsidized average tariffs in Iran, which discourages private and public sectors to investment on these systems. Environmentally, each PV system can averagely reduce 500 kg CO 2 emission in the first year of installation and fourteen of them can approximately reduce 1,613,900 kg of CO 2 emission during life time of PV panels.",Engineering; Return on investment; Net present value; Renewable energy; Electricity; Operations management; Cash; Photovoltaic system; Agricultural economics; Cost of electricity by source; Subsidy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.026,journal article,Coventry University,gb

In the efforts to mitigate such phenomena, the Malaysian government seeks to implement Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) projects. Early stage studies on Global Solar Radiation (GSR) have been carried out in several states in Malaysia including Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Kota Bharu. Afterward, data from the Malaysia Meteorological Department and the Malaysia National University have been used to estimate the monthly average daily global radiation in various locations in Malaysia. Putrajaya, a location which is implementing Malaysian Building Integrated Photovoltaic (MBIPV) is among the locations where a GSR study is currently absent. Conventional methods exist for GSR estimation with the aid of pyranometer. However, this method of GSR estimation is time consuming and not cost-effective practice. The main objective of this study is to estimate the GSR in Putrajaya. This is achieved in this study by utilizing sunshine-based data with calculated monthly average daily extraterrestrial radiation on a horizontal surface and monthly average maximum possible daily sunshine to plot a linearly fitted graph. Coefficients in the Angstrom-Prescott (A-P) model was generated from the plotted graph and was used for GSR estimation where a = 0.5 and b = 0.11. The mean percentage error (MPE) of the GSR estimation was found to be 3.4. Therefore, the estimation of GSR in Putrajaya have been successful for the first-time using sunshine-based data from dual locations method.

In this paper, a window system integrated with thin film CdTe solar cells with 10% transparency was electrically characterised by Sandia model. The annual energy performance of a typical office with this PV window applied to different facade design was investigated using EnergyPlus under five typical climatic conditions in China. The dynamic daylight performance of the office has been assessed using RADIANCE. The result shows that when compared to a conventional double glazed system, the application of PV window can result in significant energy saving potential if the office has a relative large window-to-wall ratio (i.e. WWR≥45%). The simulation results also show that this PV window offers better daylight performance than conventional double-glazing.",Optics; Daylight; Window (computing); Facade; Environmental science; Electric power; Glazing; Solar energy; Photovoltaics; Cadmium telluride photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2019.01.976,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb

Energy analysis determined that the system paid back its embodied energy in just 4.5 years. LCA revealed that the embodied impacts were offset by the electricity generated to provide a net environmental benefit in most categories. Only carcinogens, ecotoxicity and minerals had a small net lifetime burden. A financial analysis was undertaken from the householder's perspective, alongside cost-benefit analysis from a societal perspective. The results of both indicated that the systems are unlikely to pay back their investment over the 25 year lifetime.

Thus, glazing transmission angular behaviour is more crucial than single glazing transmittance value for building energy simulation and design. In this work, the spectral behaviour of the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) glazing with three different transparencies are studied. Transmittance of the devices are measured after 2 years to understand the effects of device stability on DSSC glazing applications. The solar factor for the devices is calculated for different light incident angles for a whole year at a particular location. The correlation between clearness index and DSSC transmittance is also studied. Finally, glare analysis is performed for all the devices on a sunny day, intermittent day and overcast day, and is also compared with double glazing. It is found that the 37% transparent DSSC glazing leads to a greater reduction in disturbing glare by 21% compared to double glazing on a clear sunny day. All the above results suggest that DSSC glazings could be productively used for fenestration integration in buildings.",Optics; Transmittance; Materials science; Overcast; Building energy simulation; Fenestration; Solar cell; Glare (vision); Dye-sensitized solar cell; Glazing,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.03.146,journal article,University of Exeter,gb

A new approach is to integrate BIPV windows with thermotropic materials such as Hydroxypropyl Cellulose (HPC) hydrogel, which offers adaptive advantages for the systems to respond to time-varying weather conditions but also enhances the PV electricity generation. To design such systems, knowledge of the temperature-dependent scattering properties of the selected thermotropic materials is of significance. In this study, a Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) smart window system consisting of a thermotropic membrane synthesised using HPC and gellan gum gelling agent for electricity generation and also solar control has been designed and investigated. An advanced optical model, which combines a Monte-Carlo ray-tracing technique with an Inverse Adding-Doubling (IAD) method, has been developed for characterising the thermotropic membrane in terms of angular scattering distribution under various membrane temperatures and HPC concentrations. Then the developed optical model has been validated by comparison with experimental measurements. Subsequently, the validated optical model has been used to design and optimise the proposed BIPV smart window. The effects of HPC concentration, geometric concentration ratio, thermotropic membrane thickness and glass refractive index on PV power outputs have been evaluated. Finally, a prototype of the BIPV smart window with a 6 wt% HPC membrane has been manufactured and tested under indoor conditions. From the experimental tests, it was found that the total transmittance of the double-pane glass sample with a 6 wt% HPC membrane layer decreases from approximately 90%to 14%, when the membrane temperature increases from 27 °C to 56 °C.

This system automatically responds to climatic conditions by varying the balance of solar energy reflected to the PV for electricity generation and transmitted through the system into the building for provision of light and heat. Its success heavily relies on the understanding of the relationship between the transmittance/reflectance properties and the composition of the thermotropic layer under different environmental temperatures. Herein, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) polymer and gellan gum based hydrogel membranes with different compositions were synthesized as the reflective thermotropic layer for the smart BICPV system and their transmittance and reflectance were systematically investigated in terms of hydrogel composition and environmental temperature. Specifically, a switching temperature (Ts) of ~42 °C (6 wt. % HPC) was recorded, the measured transmittance decreases from ~ 90% to ~20%, with the temperature of the reflective layer increasing from 20°C to 60°C. No hysteresis in optical property was observed upon heating-cooling cycle of HPC membrane samples. The measured reflectivity increased with heating from ~10 % below the Ts to ~50 % above the Ts (for 6 wt. % HPC).

984,065-523-453-937-631,The Use of Feature Parameters to Asses Barrier Properties of ALD coatings for Flexible PV Substrates,2014,"This paper reports on the recent work carried out as part of the EU funded NanoMend project. The project seeks to develop integrated process inspection, cleaning, repair and control systems for nano-scale thin films on large area substrates. In the present study flexible photovoltaic films have been the substrate of interest. Flexible PV films are the subject of significant development at present and the latest films have efficiencies at or beyond the level of Si based rigid PV modules. These flexible devices are fabricated on polymer film by the repeated deposition, and patterning, of thin layer materials using roll-to-roll processes, where the whole film is approximately 3um thick prior to encapsulation. Whilst flexible films offer significant advantages in terms of mass and the possibility of building integration (BIPV) they are at present susceptible to long term environmental degradation as a result of water vapor transmission through the barrier layers to the CIGS (Copper Indium Gallium Selenide CuInxGa(1-x)Se2) PV cells thus causing electrical shorts and efficiency drops. Environmental protection of the GIGS cell is provided by a thin (40nm) barrier coating of Al2O3. The highly conformal aluminium oxide barrier layer is produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD) where, the ultra-thin Al2O3 layer is deposited onto polymer thin films before these films encapsulate the PV cell. The surface of the starting polymer film must be of very high quality in order to avoid creating defects in the device layers. Since these defects reduce manufacturing yield, in order to prevent them, a further thin polymer coating (planarization layer) is generally applied to the polymer film prior to deposition. The presence of surface irregularities on the uncoated film can create defects within the nanometre-scale, aluminium oxide, barrier layer and these are measured and characterised. This paper begins by reporting the results of early stage measurements conducted to characterise the uncoated and coated polymer film surface topography using feature parameter analysis. The measurements are carried out using a Taylor Hobson Coherence Correlation Interferometer an optical microscope and SEM. Feature parameter analysis allows the efficient separation of small insignificant defects from large defects. The presence of both large and insignificant defects is then correlated with the water vapour transmission rate as measured on representative sets of films using at standard MOCON test. The paper finishes by drawing conclusions based on analysis of WVTR and defect size, where it is postulated that small numbers of large defects play a significant role in higher levels of WVTR.",Nanotechnology; Chemical-mechanical planarization; Thin film; Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells; Materials science; Copper indium gallium selenide; Barrier layer; Coating; Optoelectronics; Atomic layer deposition; Carbon film,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/483/1/012011,journal article,University of Huddersfield,gb

Given the flexibility of the technology, the use of ray-trace modelling is indispensable in the design, performance evaluation, and optimisation of LSCs. This work begins by comparing a three dimensional (3D) ray-trace model of an LSC with experimental results. The study includes 70 samples – both square and circular LSCs, containing five different fluorescent organic dyes (BASF Lumogen) each at seven different concentrations. The figure-of-merit used for performance evaluation was the average power density determined at the LSC edge sheet, measured using an optical fibre connected to a spectrometer. The results demonstrate that 3D ray-trace results gives good agreement with the experimental measurements, to within around ±5% within a wide concentration range (optical density=0.05–8) and a maximum difference of ±13%. The wide range of colours achieved is presented in a CIE chart. Overall, the validated experimental results give confidence in the use of modelling for future larger LSCs for BIPV.

With a global PV installed capacity of 303 GW, a nominal 10 °C decrease in their average temperature could theoretically lead to 15 GW increase in electricity production worldwide. Currently, there is a gap in the research knowledge concerning the effectiveness of the available passive thermal regulation techniques for BICPV, both individually and working in tandem. This paper presents a novel combined passive cooling solution for BICPV incorporating micro-fins, Phase Change Material (PCM) and Nanomaterial Enhanced PCM (n-PCM). This work was undertaken with the aim to assess the unreported to date benefits of introducing these solutions into BICPV systems and to quantify their individual as well as combined effectiveness. The thermal performance of an un-finned metallic plate was first compared to a micro-finned plate under naturally convective conditions and then compared with applied PCM and n-PCM. A designed and fabricated, scaled-down thermal system was attached to the electrical heaters to mimic the temperature profile of the BICPV. The results showed that the average temperature in the centre of the system was reduced by 10.7 °C using micro-fins with PCM and 12.5 °C using micro-fins with n-PCM as compared to using the micro-fins only. Similarly, the effect of using PCM and n-PCM with the un-finned surface demonstrated a temperature reduction of 9.6 °C and 11.2 °C respectively as compared to the case of natural convection. Further, the innovative 3-D printed PCM containment, with no joined or screwed parts, showed significant improvements in leakage control. The important thermophysical properties of the PCM and the n-PCM were analysed and compared using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter.

992,069-865-892-417-609,Simulation guided design of flexible photovoltaic laminates,2012,"Photovoltaic (PV) modules are manufactured using various PV cell technologies. The packaging requirements vary for each of the PV technologies and depend on their inherent thermo-mechanical properties and environmental stability of the cell. Thin film PV has the relative advantage of flexibility vis-a-vis their rigid and brittle competitors. This paper discusses the use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to develop a framework for guiding the design of flexible Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) shingles utilizing thin film PV cells. Microglass (0.2–0.3 mm thick glass) was chosen as the top barrier layer to exploit the flexibility of the thin film PV material. However, microglass alone does not provide sufficient protection to the shingle to meet regulatory impact resistance requirements. This paper discusses the use of FEA to guide the selection of reinforcing polymer layers and their placement around the microglass to enable microglass-based flexible laminates to sustain hail impact. FEA was used to guide the selection of reinforcing polymers and their placement in the laminate structure. Hail impact was modeled as static indentation and stresses were calculated in all layers of the laminate. This model was used to compare around 50 laminates generated through systematic variation of the polymer mechanical properties and laminate designs. Based on the analysis of the stresses generated in the microglass and other layers in these laminates, it is found that the optimal laminate design would consist of an elastomeric reinforcing layer above the microglass and a rigid polymer layer below it. An additional layer of a rigid polymer above the elastomeric layer can further reduce stresses in the laminate; however, relatively large thickness of this layer might be needed to get any significant stress reduction. The ideal location for the rigid reinforcing layer has been identified to be between the cell and the bottom barrier layer. The model predictions have been partially validated through hail impact testing.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Finite element method; Composite material; Materials science; Layer (electronics); Barrier layer; Indentation; Elastomer; Photovoltaic system; Stress (mechanics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.2012.6317978,conference article,Dow Chemical Company,gb

Six main groups with different interests were found to be involved in the introduction of BIPV (Cost Watchers, Design Aesthetes, Green Guardians, Design Optimizers, Generation Maximizers and Users). Their involvement around three sets of issues (design changes from lack of familiarity with the technology, misunderstandings from unfamiliar interdependencies of trades and the effects of standard firm procedure) is followed. Findings underline how BIPV require...",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Interdependence; Negotiation; Operations management; Social construction of technology; Underline; Co-development; Renewable technologies,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01446193.2015.1074262,journal article,University of Reading,gb
994,070-770-366-052-850,Comprehensive evaluation of window-integrated semi-transparent PV for building daylight performance,2020,"Abstract Building-integrated semi-transparent photovoltaic windows (PV windows) have been considered as a potential candidate to replace conventional windows to improve building energy efficiency and hence reduce carbon emissions. With the integration of PV windows, the indoor luminous environment may be significantly affected. The presence of solar cells may cause undesirable shading, low illuminance levels and affect colour quality of the transmitted daylight. Therefore, it is important to comprehensively assess daylight performance of PV windows to ensure a comfortable luminous environment. In this study, the daylight performance of Cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV window with four different transparencies (i.e. 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%) applied to a cellular office space has been assessed in terms of daylight quantity and daylight quality. RADIANCE was selected to predict the annual daylight performance through advanced dynamic metrics including Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI), simplified Daylight Glare Probability (DGPs) and Illuminance Uniformity (Uo). Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) and Colour Rendering Index (CRI), which are two attributes to characterise the colour quality of transmitted daylight were used to evaluate performance of the selected PV windows. CCT and CRI were calculated under three CIE standard daylight scenarios (CCT of 4000 K, 6500 K and 25000 K respectively). It is found that CdTe PV windows can significantly improve the homogeneity of daylight distribution on a task area located close to the window and reduce the risk of daylight glare when compared with the performance of a conventional double glazing. Moreover, the recommended CCT (i.e. 3000–7500 K) can be achieved with the employment of CdTe PV windows under 4000 K and 6500 K daylight scenarios. All of the CdTe PV windows examined were able to maintain CRI at a comfortable level i.e. above 90 under the three daylight scenarios.",Color temperature; Daylight; Radiance; Building energy; Semi transparent; Illuminance; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Glazing; Remote sensing,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.04.167,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb
995,071-694-953-923-416,Passive cooling technology for photovoltaic panels for domestic houses,2014,"The efficiency of photovoltaic panels decreases as the panels' temperature increases, which results in deduction of electricity generation. In order to reduce this effect, different cooling methods were proposed and investigated. This paper reviews the previous work on cooling PV cells and concludes that the cost-effectiveness, design feasibility and minimal energy consumption are the important design consideration for cooling systems. Based on these considerations, this paper reports a passive cooling method that utilizes rainwater as cooling media and a gas expansion device to distribute the rainwater. The gas is thermally expanded from receiving solar radiation as such the amount of water it pushes to flow over the PV cells is proportional with the solar radiation it received. The paper reports a design and simulation of such a system for a domestic house application. In the paper, a relationship of the gas chamber size, solar radiation and gas expansion volume was established for evaluation with respect to the variation of gas temperature and the amount of rainwater used for cooling. A heat transfer model was used to evaluate the performance of the cells by cooling with this passive device. The results show that on a design day, the passive cooling system reduces the temperature of the cells and increases electrical efficiency of the PV panel by 8.3%.

In this work, the relationship between the transparency and performance of DSSCs is studied by changing the TiO2 electrode thickness. The 10 µm thickness device shows a power conversion efficiency of 5.93% and a Jsc of 12.75 mA/cm2 with 37% transparency in the visible range. However, the performance loss in DSSCs during the scale up process is a potential drawback. This can be addressed using an optical concentrator with DSSC to generate more power from small size devices. Here, a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) is coupled with DSSCs and its performance is compared to a scaled-up device (approx. 4 times). Furthermore, the impact of operating temperature on the performance of the bare and concentrator-coupled devices is discussed in this article. An increase of 67% in power conversion efficiency is observed at 36 °C for the concentrator-coupled device under 1000 W/m2 illumination. Maximum Jsc of 25.55 mA/cm2 is achieved at 40 °C for the concentrated coupled device compare with the Jsc of 13.06 mA/cm2 for the bare cell at the same temperature.",Operating temperature; Daylighting; Concentrator; Electrode; Materials science; Energy conversion efficiency; Electric power; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Optoelectronics; Nonimaging optics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2017.10.006,journal article,University of Exeter,gb

It formally ‘tests’ the value of considering job advertisements in the design of curricula and what employers are seeking in terms of technical, professional and generic skills. It presents the general methodology using results of job advertisements from the renewable energies sector that can be used for comparison against sample Higher Education curricula in the same technical area. A number of jobs advertised on the internet in the area of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) are used as the dataset for this experiment. The full text of each job advertisement has been manually downloaded into NVivo software. Amongst other things, job title and essential or desirable technical/professional and generic skills are coded. These declared essential and desirable technical skills are shown in matrix form across the range of job titles and together both show the required graduate attributes as well as within industry sector career development or progression pathways. Viewed as a sector whole, the analysis also shows those skills that cross sub-areas and hence may be better suited to foundation modules within a programme with the skills more specific to a sub-discipline being the optional or ‘programme aligning’ modules. The results will help Higher Education develop curricula more aligned to industrial needs and will help different industries see the way skills are expressed in existing curricula.

998,073-953-744-598-932,A study on use of miniature dielectric compound parabolic concentrator (dCPC) for daylighting control application,2014,"Low-concentration solid dielectric compound parabolic concentrator (dCPC) and its variations have been widely regarded as an attractive solution to reduce the cost of a photovoltaic (PV) system, particularly for building-integrated application. Different from a mirror CPC, a dCPC allows the light beyond its acceptance angle to penetrate through its lateral surface. This escaped light could be actually used for daylighting, so the dCPC offers a potential for combined PV and daylighting application suitable for the atrium buildings or large green houses. In the modern buildings, an advanced daylighting system such as prismatic panels is used to balance between harvesting daylight and preventing excessive solar heat gain. In contrast, this study aims to evaluate the advantage of the miniature solid dCPC over common prismatic structures according to their daylight transmittance values under both standard and real sky conditions. A commercial optical analysis software PHOTOPIA is firstly used to compare the daylighting control performance between a dCPC rod and two common prismatic elements. The effect of solar altitude and azimuth angles changing with time is considered. A preliminary test under a solar simulator and a real sky condition is also introduced to provide experimental evidence regarding the advantageous feature of a dCPC rod for daylighting control.",Solar simulator; Optics; Engineering; Daylight; Transmittance; Acceptance angle; Illuminance; Solar gain; Photovoltaic system; Nonimaging optics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.12.008,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb

The 3-dimensional form of the cladding provides three advantages for outdoor OPV deployment; firstly the ‘footprint’ of the solar cell is reduced, which leads to ∼10% improved power conversion (PCE) efficiency per unit area. Secondly, the oblique angle performance is enhanced, leading to increased output in the early morning and evening. Indoor characterisation showed a 9-fold enhancement in efficiency was obtainable, when compared to a flat module. Thirdly, an improvement in performance under diffuse lighting conditions was measured, when compared to a flat module. The average daily yield of the 3D module was 17–29% higher than a flat module, with higher relative enhancements observed on cloudier days. Geographically, the 3D module appears to be well-suited to countries with a high latitude, due to the enhanced diffuse light levels and the fact that tilting the module in both ‘latitude’ and ‘longitude’ directions away from normal, leads to the best achievable enhancement in solar cell performance.

The potential of reducing the temperature of BIPV using an underneath cavity is experimentally and numerically investigated in literature. Most of the models are oversimplified in terms of modeling the impact of 3D flow over/underneath of PV modules, which can result in a non-uniform surface temperature and consequently a non-homogenous thermal degradation. Moreover, the simultaneous presence of radiation and convection related to upstream wind, in addition to the combined impact of back-ventilation and surface convection, is barely addressed in literature. However, these simplifications can result in the unrealistic loading climate conditions. This paper aims to present a unique experimental setup to provide more realistic climate conditions for investigating the ventilation potential of the underneath. The setup consists of a solar simulator and a building prototype with installed PV, placed inside an atmospheric wind tunnel to control upstream wind velocity. Thermography is performed using an infrared camera to monitor the surface temperature of the BIPV. The potential of an underneath cavity with various cavity heights and PV arrangement is further investigated in this paper. The outcome would be eventually useful in the development of practical guidelines for BIPV installation.

For the latter, a novel technique to planarise the steel substrate with an intermediate layer is also presented, with a substantial decrease in surface roughness reported to ensure that the substrate is smooth enough to use for OPV fabrication.

The temperature rise can be particularly problematic for fully building integrated PV (BIPV) roof tile systems if back ventilation is restricted. PV laminates could suffer yield degradation and accelerated aging in these conditions. This paper presents a laboratory based experimental investigation undertaken to determine the potential for high temperature operation in such a BIPV installation. This is achieved by ascertaining the dependence of the PV roof tile temperature on incident radiation and ambient temperature. A theory based correction was developed to account for the unrealistic sky temperature of the solar simulator used in the experiments. The particular PV roof tiles used are warranted up to an operational temperature of 85 °C, anything above this temperature will void the warranty because of potential damage to the integrity of the encapsulation.

In many instances, these policy tools fail to deliver on their promise, while nonetheless influencing professional and user behavior. This paper draws on Foucault’s theory of governmentality and the Sociology of Standards to explore the effect of voluntary policy tools. Whereas most research focuses on the effect of tools on either intended outcomes or formal policies, this paper considers their effect on the people who directly engage with them. The paper uses the case of the Building Research Establishments Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) to consider the embeddedness and reach of policy tools across communities of practice. The contribution of the paper lies in its focus on the way in which organizational features of BREEAM contribute to its effect on the definition of green building and peoples’ engagement with them. Theoretically, the focus on organizational aspects of governing techniques draws attention local variations in the power/knowledge effect of techniques, thereby contributing to a relatively neglected aspect of governmentality.

1007,080-348-599-898-354,"A review of urban energy system models: Approaches, challenges and opportunities",2012,"Abstract Energy use in cities has attracted significant research in recent years. However such a broad topic inevitably results in number of alternative interpretations of the problem domain and the modelling tools used in its study. This paper seeks to pull together these strands by proposing a theoretical definition of an urban energy system model and then evaluating the state of current practice. Drawing on a review of 219 papers, five key areas of practice were identified – technology design, building design, urban climate, systems design, and policy assessment – each with distinct and incomplete interpretations of the problem domain. We also highlight a sixth field, land use and transportation modelling, which has direct relevance to the use of energy in cities but has been somewhat overlooked by the literature to date. Despite their diversity, these approaches to urban energy system modelling share four common challenges in understanding model complexity, data quality and uncertainty, model integration, and policy relevance. We then examine the opportunities for improving current practice in urban energy systems modelling, focusing on the potential of sensitivity analysis and cloud computing, data collection and integration techniques, and the use of activity-based modelling as an integrating framework. The results indicate that there is significant potential for urban energy systems modelling to move beyond single disciplinary approaches towards a sophisticated integrated perspective that more fully captures the theoretical intricacy of urban energy systems.",Engineering; Problem domain; Urban climate; Design technology; Building design; Urban metabolism; Data quality; Theoretical definition; Systems design; Management science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.047,journal article,Imperial College London,gb

In this work, MoOx/ITO/Ag/ITO (MoOx/IAI) thin films with high average transmittance of 79.90% between 400 nm and 900 nm were introduced as the top transparent electrode to explore its influences on optoelectronic properties of the fabricated perovskite solar cells. MoOx has been demonstrated previously as protection from sputtering damage using a conventional ITO top electrode, however it is shown here to provide protection from a sputtered IAI film that provides superior transparency and conductivity and is deposited using more favourable low temperature processing conditions. MoOx and Ag were thermally evaporated and ITO was radio-frequency magnetron sputtered at room temperature. The resulting semi-transparent solar cells showed power conversion efficiency of 12.85% (steady-state efficiency of 11.3%) along with a much-reduced degradation rate as compared to the reference device with only a Ag top electrode. With such a combination of performance and transparency, this work shows great promise in application of perovskite solar cells into window glazing products for building integrated photovoltaic applications (BIPV), powering internet of things (IoT) and combining into tandem solar cells with industrially mature photovoltaic technologies such as silicon and copper indium gallium di-selenide (CIGS).",Perovskite (structure); Electrode; Thin film; Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells; Materials science; Energy conversion efficiency; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Indium; Silicon,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tc03684a,journal article,Swansea University,gb
1009,083-521-856-830-365,Life cycle assessment approach for renewable multi-energy system: A comprehensive analysis,2020,"Abstract In response to the gradual degradation of natural sources, there is a growing interest in adopting renewable resources for various building energy supply. In this study, a comprehensive life cycle assessment approach is proposed for a renewable multi-energy system (MES) to evaluate its primary energy consumption, economy cost and carbon emission from cradle to grave. The MES, consisting of passive side and active side, is fully driven by renewable energy including solar, wind and biomass. On the passive side, building integrated photovoltaic, solar collector and wind turbines are adopted. On the active side, the biomass-fuelled combined cooling heating and power system (CCHP) serves as the primary energy supplier. The electric compression chiller and biomass boiler are adopted when the thermal energy from the CCHP system is not sufficient, while electricity is imported from the city power grid when the electricity demand is low. A representative office building in the United Kingdom and real-life inventory data is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed life cycle assessment approach. Through life cycle assessment, the advantages and disadvantages of the MES are compared with the reference CCHP system and conventional separate system in view of life cycle primary energy consumption, economy cost and carbon emission. Moreover, to gain an insight into the life cycle performance, the sensitivity analysis is conducted on the rated capacity of the power generation unit, climate zones, life span, recycle ratio and interest rate. The life cycle cost of MES is relatively higher than the conventional separate system mainly owing to the high construction cost of BIPV, wind turbine, solar collector and biomass feedstock. However, its life cycle primary energy consumption and carbon emission are much lower. It is believed that the proposed life cycle assessment approach can provide useful guidelines for government in policymaking and for building engineers in retrofitting works.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Primary energy; Renewable resource; Renewable energy; Process engineering; Life-cycle assessment; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Wind power,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113354,journal article,University of the West of England,gb

Overheating is known to be one of the major deficiencies in reaching the targeted lifespan goals. Alongside the thermal degradation, the operational efficiency of the silicon-based solar panel drops when the surface temperature exceeds certain thresholds close to 25 °C. Wind-driven cooling, therefore, is widely recommended to decrease the surface temperature of PV panels using cavity cooling through their rear surfaces. Wind-driven flow can predominantly contribute to cavity cooling if a suitable design for the installation of the BIPV systems is considered.; ; In general, various correlations in the form of Nu=CReaNu=CRea are adapted from heat convection of flat-plates to calculate the heat removal from the BIPV surfaces. However, these correlations demonstrate a high discrepancy with realistic conditions due to a more complex flow around BIPVs in comparison with the flat-plate scenarios. This study offers a significantly more reliable correlation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique to visualize and thus investigate the flow characteristics around and beneath BIPVs. The CFD model is comprehensively validated against a particle velocimetry and a thermography study by Mirzaei et al. (2014) and Mirzaei and Carmeliet (2013b). The velocity field shows a very good agreement with the experimental results while the average surface temperature has a 6.0 % discrepancy in comparison with the thermography study.

These are the policy and decision makers, the leading consultants and the contractors. The main constrains of the dissemination of BIVP and BIWE, according to the policy and decision makers, are: lack of knowledge and awareness of the public in sustainable technology, low cost of electricity, low cost of gas and oil and difficulty in applying local environmental taxes. The consultants had attributed the constrains to ignorance of life cycle cost of PV and Wind turbines systems, lack of education and knowledge in sustainable design, political system, shortage of markets importing sustainable technologies and client worries in profitability and pay-back period.

Multi-energy systems, fuelled by renewable energy, including solar and biomass energy, are gaining increasing adoption in commercial buildings. Most of previous capacity design approaches are formulated based upon conventional operating schedules, which result in inappropriate design capacities and ineffective operating schedules of the multi-energy system. Therefore, a two-stage capacity optimization approach is proposed for the multi-energy system with its optimal operating schedule taken into consideration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed capacity optimization approach, it is tested on a renewable energy fuelled multi-energy system in a commercial building. The primary energy devices of the multi-energy system consist of biomass gasification-based power generation unit, heat recovery unit, heat exchanger, absorption chiller, electric chiller, biomass boiler, building integrated photovoltaic and photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector. The variable efficiency owing to weather condition and part-load operation is also considered.

The two optimization stages are interrelated; thus, the optimal design and operation of the multi-energy system can be obtained simultaneously and effectively.

The objective of this paper is the quantitative evaluation of the main environmental impacts of two selected PV power systems-a ground-based 1 MWp system in Toledo, Spain and a 40 kWp building integrated facade in Newcastle upon Tyne, NE England-using the methodology of life cycle analysis (LCA). Both systems use silicon wafer technology at present, but the Newcastle facade was also studied with the incorporation CdTe modules. The results of the LCA show that atmospheric emissions are the priority impacts with respect to the assessed PV power systems. Comparing Si wafer systems, the CO/sub 2/ emissions were 88 t/GWh for the Toledo PV plant and 143 t/GWh for the BIPV facade. If the facade had used electrodeposited CdTe, the CO/sub 2/ emissions would fall to about 50 t/GWh.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Facade; Pv plant; Pv power; Fuel cycle; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Air pollution; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.1997.654343,conference article,Northumbria University,gb

A holistic systems-based approach to achieve energy positive house has been taken. Long-term economic and technical feasibility analysis have been carried out based on a validated thermal and energy model of the house. The economic analysis employs the Return on Investment (ROI) method and considers changes to government financial support and technology progress over time. Results show that the extra investment on the house, compared with that for building a standard social house of similar size, can be paid back within the system lifespan under both the old Feed-in Tariff and its proposed replacement with reduced financial support. Variants examined in the technical feasibility analysis include housing type, orientation and location. Results show that the house can be replicated to achieve an energy positive performance for all variant combinations. Among the variants, location has the highest impact on building performance including annual electricity import, CO2 emission and electricity self-sufficient ratio, with South UK performing better than North UK. This implies that more efficient or advanced technologies would be needed to achieve similar building or system performance in areas of unfavourable climate. The outcome of the research has demonstrated the affordability of the energy positive house, and the technical feasibility of its replication with different housing types, orientations and locations in the UK. This study supports the wide scale replication of this affordable systems-based approach in domestic building design and construction when incorporating appropriate technologies.",Environmental economics; Business; Return on investment; Renewable energy; Building design; Tariff; Investment (macroeconomics); Technical feasibility; Scale (social sciences); Replication (computing),http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/329/1/012049,journal article,Cardiff University,gb

Lighting control and building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) are two effective measures in reducing overall primary energy consumption and carbon emission during building operation. Due to the complex energy nature of the building, accurate day-ahead prediction of heating, cooling, lighting loads and BIPV electrical power production is essential in building energy management. Owing to the changing metrological conditions, diversity and complexity of buildings, building energy load demands and BIPV electrical power production is highly variable. This may lead to poor building energy management, extra primary energy consumption or thermal discomfort. In this study, three machine learning-based multi-objective prediction frameworks are proposed for simultaneous prediction of multiple energy loads. The three machine learning techniques are artificial neural network, support vector regression and long-short-term-memory neural network. Since heating, cooling, lighting loads and BIPV electrical power production share similar affecting factors, it is computational time saving to adopt the proposed multi-objective prediction framework to predict multiple building energy loads and BIPV power production. The ANN-based predictive model results in the smallest mean absolute percentage error while SVM-based one cost the shortest computation time.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Machine learning; Mean absolute percentage error; Artificial intelligence; Power (physics); Energy (signal processing); Energy consumption; Electric power; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Artificial neural network,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102283,journal article,University of the West of England,gb

We report here the effect of WO3 as an inorganic HTM for carbon electrodes for improved stability in PSCs, which are made under ambient conditions. Sequential fabrication of the PSC was performed under ambient conditions with mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 layers, and, on the top of these layers, the WO3 nanoparticle-embedded carbon electrode was used. Different concentrations of WO3 nanoparticles as HTM incorporated in carbon counter electrodes were tested, which varied the stability of the cell under ambient conditions. The addition of 7.5% WO3 (by volume) led to a maximum power conversion efficiency of 10.5%, whereas the stability of the cells under ambient condition was ∼350 h, maintaining ∼80% of the initial efficiency under light illumination. At the same time, the higher WO3 concentration exhibited an efficiency of 9.5%, which was stable up to ∼500 h with a loss of only ∼15% of the initial efficiency under normal atmospheric conditions and light illumination.

In this work, thermal and electrical performances of a multicrystalline silicon based PV-vacuum glazing were characterised using indoor test cell. For this particular combined system, PV covered 32% of the glazing area. Two different combinations of PV-vacuum glazing systems were manufactured where for the first case vacuum glazing faced test cell external environment (VPS) and for the second case vacuum glazing faced test cell internal environment (SPV). SPV type was found to have superior performance as PV cell achieved lower temperature than VPS type after 125 min exposure under 1000 W/m2 constant intensity from a simulator. For this type PV-vacuum glazing, overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) was 0.8 W/m2 K and the solar factor was 0.42.

Defects in the barrier layers of PV modules causing high WVTR are not well characterised and understood. A WVTR of ~10−1 g/m2/day is sufficient for the most packaging applications, but ≤10−6 g/m2/day is required for the encapsulation of long–life flexible PV modules (Carcia et al., 2010a, 2010b). In this study, surface metrology techniques along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for a quantitative characterisation of the barrier film defects. The investigation have provided clear evidence for the correlation of surface defect density and the transmission of water vapour through the barrier coating layer.

The building sector is responsible for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption in Europe. In order to achieve substantial energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, low-energy retrofitting of existing buildings becomes a very important challenge/opportunity in both domestic and non-domestic buildings. A considerable number of existing buildings are either protected or contain hazardous materials limiting the potential for conventional retrofitting approaches for improving the existing facades. Retrofitting Solutions and Services for the enhancement of Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings (RESSEEPE) is an EU-funded research project that focuses on the refurbishment of existing public buildings in different European cities. A case study approach is used to implement and monitor the performance of a range of building fabric materials. The case study focuses on a demo building in Coventry University, located within the city centre of Coventry. The paper documents the materials selection and the low-carbon refurbishment, monitoring and simulation process followed. As asbestos was found in the building, it was necessary to ensure that the materials and technologies selected didn’t interfere with the existing elements of the facade. The materials finally installed were specifically selected to work as an addition of layers rather than substitution of elements. The living lab nature of the demo-site aims to set an example for low carbon refurbishment in protected or existing buildings with hazardous materials, with a non-invasive approach based on state-of-the-art materials and technologies.",Engineering; Passive solar building design; Architectural engineering; Work (electrical); Hazardous waste; Efficient energy use; Retrofitting; Facade; Living lab; Greenhouse gas,http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/str170161,journal article,"Coventry University, UK",gb
1023,093-092-856-024-769,A numerical and experimental analysis of an integrated TEG-PCM power enhancement system for photovoltaic cells,2019,"Abstract Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells especially crystal silicon cells have witnessed a soaring installed capacity during past years. Research efforts have been made to increase the PV conversion efficiency and one direction is towards the cooling of PV systems since a higher PV temperature impairs its conversion efficiency. Phase change materials (PCM) capable of storing large amounts of latent heat are found to be effective on cooling PV cells while thermoelectric generators (TEG) which are solid waste heat converters can be used for converting the heat from PV into electricity. Therefore, this research investigates the concept of an integrated thermoelectric PCM system to enhance the PV efficiency. Theoretical investigations found that the TEGs had small power output due to small temperature difference under natural convection conditions. However, PCM was effective on hampering PV temperature increase during heat storage process. This research developed a numerical model for thermal simulations of the integrated system and has been validated by experimental results. The effect of various PCM thicknesses, conductivities and phase change temperatures were evaluated. The simulation results stressed the importance of high PCM conductivity for a thick PCM layer to reduce its insulation effect on the TEG and PV layers. Finally, the best thermal performance for the PV/TEG/PCM system was achieved with a 50 mm thick PCM layer with thermal conductivity of 5 W/m K and a phase change temperature of 40–45 °C. Further optimisation and experimental evaluation are however being recommended towards the establishment of the full technical and scientific boundaries.",Nuclear engineering; Thermoelectric generator; Thermal energy storage; Materials science; Thermal; Energy conversion efficiency; Photovoltaic system; Latent heat; Thermoelectric effect; Thermal conductivity,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.147,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb

However, the introduction of colour into photovoltaics often involves increased cost and decreased efficiency. A method was found to add colour to photovoltaics, using luminescent materials: fluorescent organic dyes (BASF Lumogen). These selectively absorb and emit light, giving a good balance between colour addition and electricity production from underlying photovoltaic cells. Very small amounts of Lumogen dye were added to a silicone encapsulant (Dow Corning Sylgard 184), which was then used hold photovoltaic cells in place between sheets of painted glass. When making sufficient quantities of dyed encapsulant for a 600 x 450 mm testpiece, the dye colours faded, with low levels of fluorescence, although some colour was retained. Improvement of the method, including testing of alternative encapsulant materials, is required, to ensure that the dyes continue to fluoresce within the encapsulant. Although the Lumogen dyes are quite stable when compared to other dye molecules, in general organic dyes are not yet sufficiently durable to make this technology viable for installations that are to last for more than 20 years: the guaranteed lifetime of standard photovoltaic modules. Dye replenishment, or replacement of materials, will be required; or a product with a shorter ‘useful’ lifetime identified. This method opens up a wide variety of architectural glass design opportunities that incorporate photovoltaics, providing an example of one new medium to make eco-architecture more aesthetically pleasing, whilst generating electricity.",Sustainable design; Nanotechnology; Materials science; Architectural glass; Renewable technologies; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/arc140331,conference article,Heriot-Watt University,gb

1027,101-471-010-552-689,Ideal performance of a self-cooling greenhouse,2019,"Abstract The self-cooling greenhouse is a concept to enable crop cultivation in adversely hot climates. It sacrifices a fraction γ of the incident solar energy to drive a refrigeration system, thus lowering the internal temperature below ambient. Heat is actively rejected to a stream of coolant such as air or water. To maintain availability of sunlight for photosynthesis, γ should be as small as possible. Nonetheless, the laws of thermodynamics dictate a minimum value of γ. Using the approach of endoreversible thermodynamics and the theory of selective blackbody absorbers, we determine ideal minimum values achievable for cases of both thermal and photovoltaic solar collection with and without solar concentration. To achieve an internal temperature 10 °C below that of the incoming coolant, a minimum γ = 0.056 is needed using multicolour absorption at maximum concentration C = 46300 – representing an absolute minimum for either type of solar collection. Without concentration (C = 1) a selective thermal collector permits minimum γ = 0.089 and a single-junction PV solar collector permits minimum γ = 0.15.

The most ideal form of a BIPV is a multi-functional and ecological convergence through a passive concept application of a photovoltaic module for a building. The solar architecture needs to consider the architectural culture and history of the region through an ecological convergence which is applicable to a passive concept if the environment, energy and comfort problems will be effectively mitigated. The evaluation standard is needed to fulfill these requirements of solar architecture. The renewable energy sources are getting very hot issues, due to the environmental pollution, global warming, and energy shortage, etc. It is reasonable to disseminate the representative energy systems which could be ecologically convergent with the regional architecture.

The conclusion is that policies on urban form should be driven not by existing technologies but by the disrup- tive technologies of the future.

This task is, however, complicated by a range of factors, including slow renewal and renovation rates of buildings, multiple non-coordinated actors, conservative building practices and limited competence to innovate. Drawing from academic literature published during 2005–2015, this article carries out a systematic review of case studies on low energy innovations in the European residential building sector, analysing their drivers. Specific attention is paid to intermediary actors in facilitating innovation processes and creating new opportunities. The study finds that qualitative case study literature on low energy building innovation has been limited, particularly regarding the existing building stock. Environmental concerns, EU and national and local policies have been the key drivers; financial, knowledge and social sustainability and equity drivers have been of modest importance; while design, health and comfort and market drivers have played a minor role. Intermediary organisations and individuals have been important through five processes: (1) facilitating individual building projects, (2) creating niche markets, (3) implementing new practices in social housing stock, (4) supporting new business model creation and (5) facilitating building use post-construction.

This paper introduces a novel multifunctional PV/Thermal/Daylighting (PV/T/D) system by incorporating a transpired solar collector with the dielectric CPC panel. The thermal performance of system was investigated through simulations by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and experiments. Parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the effects on the thermal performance by different design criteria such as approach velocity, plenum height, pitch and diameter of perforation, porosity and solar radiation level. The experiments were taken under both indoor solar simulator and outdoor real sky conditions.

In this work, to maintain solar cell operating temperature and improve its performance, a phase change material (PCM) container has been designed, developed and integrated with the BICPV system. Using highly collimated continuous light source, an indoor experiment was performed. The absolute electrical power conversion efficiency for the module without PCM cooling resulted in 7.82% while using PCM increased it to 9.07%, thus showing a relative increase by 15.9% as compared to a non- PCM system.

1037,108-278-480-101-567,Assessing overheating risk and thermal comfort in state-of-the-art prototype houses that combat exacerbated climate change in UK,2019,"Abstract There is growing evidence that terraced houses—thermally lightweight, well insulated, naturally ventilated with three exposed wall surfaces—are at risk of overheating, especially in south-eastern England. The aim of this study is to evaluate the building performance and develop a reliable building simulation, which will be employed in the second phase of the study: developing affordable and feasible passive design strategies to support the energy-efficient building systems of the construction industry. This paper reports on the results from the first phase of the study where a quantitative methodology, including indoor and outdoor environmental monitoring, in-situ measurements and building simulation modelling, was adopted. The performance of a case study was modelled and simulated via employing Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) software suite. The results from the base-case were analysed according to the adaptive thermal comfort of Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Technical Memorandum 52 guidelines: The Limits of Thermal Comfort—Avoiding Overheating in European Buildings. The spaces studied within the case study house were observed to exceed the acceptable limits of thermal comfort; particularly, the large bedroom within this zone exceeded the upper limit for overheating up to 11 h daily. Furthermore, the results from the monitoring study indicate a high risk of summertime overheating across all the case study settings, especially during short-term peaks in outdoor temperatures. The main reasons for the problematic thermal performance were identified as well-insulated and fully air-tight building fabric, the lack of sufficient ventilation through the living spaces and excessive heat gains through the composite cladding material.",Climate change; Thermal comfort; Passive solar building design; Architectural engineering; Overheating (electricity); Bedroom; Construction industry; Building simulation; Environmental science; Environmental monitoring,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.01.030,journal article,University of East London,gb
1038,111-167-125-882-748,Optimization of finned solar photovoltaic phase change material (finned pv pcm) system,2018,"Abstract Heat generation during the operation of the photovoltaic (PV) cell raises its temperature and results in reduced electrical output. The heat produced in the process can be removed by attaching phase change material (PCM) at the back of the PV panel which can contain the PV temperature substantially and increase its efficiency. Fins can be used inside the PCM container to enhance the heat transfer. In literature, it is observed that as soon as PCM is melted completely, the heat extraction rate of PCM reduces which again leads to increase in PV temperature. However, the study carrying out the optimization of Finned-PV-PCM system to keep PV temperature low during operation for different solar irradiance levels is not available in literature. Thus, in the current study, the most suitable depth of PCM container is calculated for different solar irradiance levels. In addition, how it is affected with spacing between successive fins, fin length and fin thickness has been studied. The best fin dimensions are also calculated. The results show that the most suitable depth of PCM container is 2.8 cm for ∑IT = 3 kWh/m2/day and 4.6 cm for ∑IT = 5 kWh/m2/day for the chosen parameters. The best spacing between successive fins (to keep PV temperature low) is 25 cm, best fin thickness is 2 mm and best fin length is the one when it touches the bottom of the container. PV, PV-PCM and Finned-PV-PCM systems are also compared. For PV-PCM system (without fins), the most suitable depth of PCM container is 2.3 cm for ∑IT = 3 kWh/m2/day and 3.9 cm for ∑IT = 5 kWh/m2/day.",Thermal management of electronic devices and systems; Composite material; Materials science; Phase-change material; Heat generation; Photovoltaic system; Heat transfer; Fin; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2018.04.033,journal article,University of Exeter,gb

Previous studies have attempted to quantify this effect empirically for a variety of cell types. However, the performance varies significantly with location, both due to weather conditions and local construction practices, which in turn leads to different levels of ventilation and thermal gradients. We hereby use a purpose built roof construction with 4 different roof configurations and integrate monocrystalline Si modules in each to quantify differences in annual yields resulting from each roof type.

This paper explores the use and benefit of solar concentrators in the solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. First, a short literature review of previous research on the usage of solar concentrators in improving solar PV system performance and reducing the cost of implementation is presented. This is followed by an overview of SolarBrane, an example of a Building Integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system which uses an optical concentrator in the solar PV design. An optimised design of the SolarBrane is also discussed afterwards. A financial benefit study is conducted to compare the average return of investment of using the optimised SolarBrane and traditional solar PV installed in Malaysia’s environment. SolarBrane has proven to be a good alternative to achieve costeffective solar PV system. The financial analysis simulated under the new Malaysian Feed–In Tariff scheme indicates that the optimised SolarBrane could potentially reduce the initial cost of implementation by 40% and generate higher return, close to 20%, when compared to traditional solar PV systems. ; 				; 				Key words: Solar photovoltaic; solar concentrator; solarBrane; dielectric totally internally reflecting concentrator; financial analysis",Engineering; Architectural engineering; Automotive engineering; Grid parity; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Photovoltaic mounting system; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Solar cable; Solar shingle,http://dx.doi.org/10.11113/jt.v55.914,journal article,Glasgow Caledonian University,gb

Part 2: Physical realisation and laboratory testing,2020,"Abstract Building Integrated Photovoltaic Thermal (BIPV/T) systems which generate electricity and heat simultaneously are promising solutions for Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). Despite BIPV/T offering clear energetic and space saving advantages compared to separate PV and solar thermal, overheating problems occur when no thermal demand exists, resulting in reduced yields, stagnation damage, and excessive fluid flow pressures. This two-part study examines an alternative approach combining BIPV, Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diodes (PLVTD) and Integrated Collector-Storage Solar Water Heaters (ICSSWH) to achieve BIPV/T functionality and retain heat overnight to minimises parasitic demands and reduce overheating. The introductory paper (Part 1 of 2) established novelty and rationale for BIPV-PLVTD-ICSSWH concepts, reviewed state-of-the-art and performance benchmarks, and used theoretical modelling to predict behaviour from key design and operational parameters. This paper (Part 2 of 2) describes prototype realisation and multi-day solar simulator laboratory thermal and photovoltaic testing for covered and uncovered variants exposed to different irradiance levels. Measured solar thermal efficiencies with and without transparent covers were ηT,col = 60% and 58% respectively under zero heat loss conditions whilst overnight heat loss coefficients were Ur,sysAsys/u = 23.0 and 25.4 W·m–3 K−1 respectively, showing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Photovoltaic performance reduced with increasing absorber temperature as expected, although maximum power point efficiencies (ηE,mpp = 11.4% at T1 ≈ 25 °C and 5.6% at T1 ≈ 89 °C, without cover) were lower than expected owing to partial delamination and PV cell damage.

The model allows the calculation of the Sustainable building index (SBI), which ranges from 0.1 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest); the higher figure the more chance for launching BIPV or BIWT. This model was tested in Bahrain and the calculated SBI was found 0.47. This means that an extensive effort must be made through policies on renewable energy, renewable energy education, and incentives to BIPV and BIWT projects, environmental awareness and promotion to clean and sustainable energy for building and construction projects.

1046,128-119-138-173-271,Global analysis of photovoltaic energy output enhanced by phase change material cooling,2014,"Abstract This paper describes a global analysis to determine the increase in annual energy output attained by a PV system with an integrated phase change material (PCM) layer. The PCM acts as a heat sink and limits the peak temperature of the PV cell thereby increasing efficiency. The simulation uses a one-dimensional energy balance model with ambient temperature, irradiance and wind speed extracted from ERA-Interim reanalysis climate data over a 1.5° longitude  ×  1.5° latitude global grid. The effect of varying the PCM melting temperature from 0 °C to 50 °C was investigated to identify the optimal melting temperature at each grid location. PCM-enhanced cooling is most beneficial in regions with high insolation and little intra-annual variability in climate. When using the optimal PCM melting temperature, the annual PV energy output increases by over 6% in Mexico and eastern Africa, and over 5% in many locations such as Central and South America, much of Africa, Arabia, Southern Asia and the Indonesian archipelago. In Europe, the energy output enhancement varies between 2% and nearly 5%. In general, high average ambient temperatures correlate with higher optimal PCM melting temperatures. The sensitivity to PCM melting temperature was further investigated at locations where large solar PV arrays currently exist or are planned to be constructed. Significant improvements in performance are possible even when a sub-optimal PCM melting temperature is used. A brief economic assessment based on typical material costs and energy prices shows that PCM cooling is not currently cost-effective for single-junction PV.",Meteorology; Wind speed; Heat sink; Energy balance; Phase-change material; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Irradiance; Heat transfer; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.083,journal article,University of Leeds,gb
1047,128-924-306-201-860,Integrated semi-transparent cadmium telluride photovoltaic glazing into windows: Energy and daylight performance for different architecture designs,2018,"Abstract When integrating photovoltaics into building windows, the photovoltaic glazing modules inhibit the function that glass performs, with the additional function of energy production. Semi-transparent Photovoltaic (STPV) glazing will absorb part of the solar radiation incident on the window surface to generate electrical power. In turn, this affects the overall solar energy and natural daylight penetrating into the indoor space. Various factors determine the building energy performance and indoor comfort level as a result of adopting STPV glazing. The factors regarding window design alone (window size, PV glazing coverage ratio and PV glazing placing position) require rigorous study. In this paper, an innovate model (combined optical, electrical and energy model) was developed to comprehensively evaluate the performance of an office equipped with STPV window and firstly analyse the effect of window design on overall energy efficiency. A double-glazing unit integrated with thin film CdTe solar cells with 10% transparency was electrically characterised by Sandia Array Performance Model (SAPM). The annual energy performance of a typical office served by window integrated STPV glazing was investigated through EnergyPlus simulation for various window designs under five typical climatic conditions in China (using weather files of Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Kunming for representation). The optical performance (defined by a Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function) of this STPV glazing was also obtained using a ray-tracing technique. Then, the annual daylight performance of the porotype office was assessed using RADIANCE. We found that when compared to a conventional double-glazed system, the application of PV window can result in considerable energy saving if the office has a relatively large window-to-wall ratio (i.e. ≥ 45%), while the position of placing STPV glazing has significant influence on the lighting energy consumption. In the specific climates under test, the optimal design scenario of applying window integrated PV can result in a reduction in energy consumption of up to 73%. The simulation results also show that this PV window offers better daylight performance than conventional double glazing and effectively reduces the possibility of glare.",Daylight; Automotive engineering; Efficient energy use; Window (computing); Energy consumption; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Glazing; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.133,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb

Recent developments in this field have shown that the PVT system can yield electrical, thermal and combined PVT efficiencies of 13.8%, 54.6% and 68.4% respectively. This introduces the application of a semi-transparent PV to a photovoltaic thermal collector (PVT) system. A new design is proposed with two semi-transparent PVs (STPVs) to enhance the PVT performance. The semi-transparent PV (STPV) will replace the conventional glass cover, and hence will permit a certain percentage of solar radiation to pass through it. The performance of the new PVT configuration with double and single glazing was analysed, where in the double glazing, the STPV replaces the lower glazing. The thermal and electrical efficiencies of the new design configuration were investigated under different climatic conditions at Malaysia, Sudan and UK. The simulation results reveal that the new PVT system could achieve electrical, thermal and combined PVT efficiencies of 20.76%, 65.7% and 86.5% respectively, enhancing the electrical efficiency due to the use of two semi-transparent PV panels and thus improving the energy harvested per unit area, putting a positive step toward the application of a multilayer semi-transparent mono-crystalline silicon PV. However, the PVT glazing is more effective in locations with relatively low ambient temperature, while it is found not feasible in locations with considerably higher temperature.

Flexible metallic and polyimide foils are frequently used, but in this work an alternative substrate with attractive properties, ultra-thin glass (UTG) has been employed. CdTe solar cells with average efficiency reaching 14.7% AM1.5G efficiency have been produced on UTG of 100 μm thickness. Little has been reported on the effects on PV performance when flexed, so we investigated the effects on J-V parameters when the measurements were performed in 40 mm and 32 mm bend radius, and in a planar state before and after the bend curvature was applied. The flat J-V measurements after 32 mm bending test showed some improvement in efficiency, Voc and FF, with values higher than the first measurement in a planar state. In addition, two CdTe solar cells with identical initial performance were subjected to 32 mm static bending test for 168 hours, the results showed excellent uniformity and stability and no significant variation on J-V parameters was observed. External quantum efficiency and capacitance voltage measurements were performed and showed no significant change in spectral response or carrier concentration. Residual stress analysis showed that no additional strain was induced within the film after the bending test and that the overall strain was low. This has demonstrated the feasibility of using CdTe solar cells on UTG in new applications, when a curved module is required without compromising performance.",Bend radius; Materials science; Quantum efficiency; Power density; Polyimide; Residual stress; Substrate (electronics); Optoelectronics; Cadmium telluride photovoltaics; Bending,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2020.110552,journal article,Swansea University,gb

Previous studies have primarily focussed on temporal and spatial studies of PCM temperature within the BIPV systems but the current work also discusses the effect of PCM on electrical parameters of the BICPV systems. Due to the inadequacy of the earlier reported model, a new analytical model is proposed and implemented with the in-house controlled experiments. Paraffin wax based RT42 was used within an in-house designed and fabricated PCM containment. An indoor experiment was performed using highly collimated continuous light source at 1000 W m −2 . Results show an increase in relative electrical efficiency by 7.7% with PCM incorporation. An average reduction in module centre temperature by 3.8 °C was recorded in the BICPV–PCM integrated system as compared to the naturally ventilated system without PCM.

The results indicate that most of the research is about how calibration of the parameters influences the performance of the system. It also reveals that there are very few studies on the PV integrated shading devices where a holistic approach has been used for system evaluation which take comprehensive account of all influential factors. Based on the findings of this paper, it is advisable that there is a need for more in-depth study of system configurations under the specific circumstances which are highlighted in this paper.",Architecture; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Integrated design; School of thought; Statement (computer science); Facade; Photovoltaic system; Facade engineering; Systems theory,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.259,journal article,University of Brighton,gb
1056,139-399-482-842-559,Reduction of optical losses in colored solar cells with multilayer antireflection coatings,2011,"Solar modules are becoming an everyday presence in several countries. So far, the installation of such modules has been performed without esthetic concerns, typical locations being rooftops or solar power plants. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems represent an interesting, alternative approach for increasing the available area for electricity production and potentially for further reducing the cost of solar electricity. In BIPV, the visual impression of a solar module becomes important, including its color. The color of a solar module is determined by the color of the cells in the module, which is given by the antireflection coating (ARC). The ARC is a thin film structure that significantly increases the amount of current produced by and, hence, the efficiency of a solar cell. The deposition of silicon nitride single layer ARCs with a dark blue color is the most common process in the industry today and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is mostly used for this purpose. However, access to efficient, but differently colored solar cells are important for the further development of BIPV. In this paper, the impact of varying the color of an ARC upon the optical characteristics and efficiency of a solar cell is investigated. The overall transmittance and reflectance of a set of differently colored single layer ARCs are compared with multilayered silicon nitride ARCs, all made using PECVD. These are again compared with porous silicon ARCs fabricated using an electrochemical process allowing for the rapid and simple manufacture of ARC structures with many tens of layers. In addition to a comparison of the optical characteristics of such solar cells, the effect of using colored ARCs on solar cell efficiency is quantified using the solar cell modeling tool PC1D. This work shows that the use of multilayer ARC structures can allow solar cells with a range of different colors throughout the visual spectrum to retain very high efficiencies.",Solar mirror; Solar simulator; Optics; Solar cell efficiency; Materials science; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Solar power; Solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Plasmonic solar cell; Optoelectronics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2011.03.005,journal article,Energy Institute,gb
1057,152-043-086-708-423,The potential to exploit use of building-integrated photovoltaics in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council,2009,"The use of renewable forms of energy is important throughout the world, not just in countries where there are concerns over the availability of fossil fuels. In order to develop and promote suitable energy policies for the future it is necessary to gain an understanding of stakeholder views in all countries, including those with substantial fossil fuel reserves. The volume of construction work in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has recently been at unprecedented levels, with a huge environmental impact from construction and also from potential future energy demands. The aim of this paper is to assess the potential to exploit use of a particular, but valuable, renewable energy option: building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) in those countries. Such exploitation could offset, at least in some part, the future environmental burdens. A large-scale survey, followed by a number of in-depth interviews, has been undertaken in order to examine the use of BIPV. Empirical research findings are presented, and then analysed in order to determine the current viability of a large-scale expansion of BIPV in the GCC region. The research indicates that the main factors hindering expansion are high costs and the negative public perception of BIPV in the countries concerned. Proposals are therefore provided to assist the development of suitable policies and the wider introduction of viable BIPV in the GCC markets.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Empirical research; Forms of energy; Engineering; Energy policy; Environmental impact assessment; Exploit; Natural resource economics; Renewable energy; Stakeholder; Economic growth,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2008.07.002,journal article,University of Sheffield,gb

However, low cell efficiency remains an obstacle for their applications in windows. Using light trapping structures in DSSCs shows the potential to improve solar to electrical conversion efficiency. In this work, different pyramid-patterned titanium dioxide (TiO2) geometries are designed to enhance the photon absorption in DSSCs, and characterised using a Monte-Carlo algorithm based 3D ray-tracing simulation. Various studies were carried out under average irradiation, spectrum dependent irradiation and different solar incidental angles, respectively. The simulation results at the average irradiation wavelength (540 nm) were compared to those from a previous study using Scanning Photocurrent Microscopy (SPCM) and a reasonable agreement has been achieved. It was found that the structure based on the pyramid array of side wall angle 54.7° can significantly enhance light absorption by up to ~25% and the maximum achievable photocurrent density (MAPD) by up to ~45% across the spectrum of 380–800 nm, when compared to a planar control counterpart.",Irradiation; Materials science; Energy conversion efficiency; Photocurrent; Solar gain; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Optoelectronics; Photovoltaics; Absorption (electromagnetic radiation); Wavelength,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12273-018-0485-1,journal article,University of Nottingham,gb

Such clusters can support particles in upper layers which reduce the available area for photon capture by a much smaller amount than particles resting directly on the glass surface.

To alleviate enhanced temperature from both BIPV and BAPV, active and passive cooling can be introduced, however passive techniques are influential in trimming down the temperature for retrofit building. Shading from snow, dust cover and nearby building can be an obstacle for BIPV/BAPV application.

These include micro-wind turbines, photovoltaics, small hydro power generators and bio-tech systems. Besides building integrated solar electric generators otherwise referred to as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which is aesthetically appealing and forms part of the applied building fabrics, most other options could deform the building aesthetics and require large spaces for both installation and operation especially, the wind turbine. These advantages and more make BIPV one of the most attractive sustainable energy technologies in contemporary building sectors at the moment. The technology involves the integration of photovoltaics (PV) modules into the fabric and shell of buildings like the roofs, asphalt shingles, facade materials and shading elements. Used in this way the integrated PV modules could replace conventional building materials thereby benefiting from improved capital cost and reduction of carbon footprint in the applied environment. However, one major lapse identified with previous studies had been the unavailability of numerical methods and quantification of the CO2 mitigated by applied low carbon technologies.; ; Using a parametric method with the aid of Kyoto platform software integrated into a state of the art SMA data technology, this paper assesses and quantifies the CO2 avoidance by a building integrated solar electric system applied in a business/commercial building in the UK.; ; The CO2 protection capacity of the solar electric system has been confirmed to be influenced by the different seasons of the year providing maximum environmental protection in the summer months.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Zero-energy building; Facade; Carbon footprint; Electricity generation; Photovoltaics; Building science; Low-energy house,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsbe.2015.10.003,journal article,University of Derby,gb

The study focuses upon a Northern European climate and the significance of module orientation upon energy yield across diurnal, seasonal change and climatic conditions are discussed. It is shown that the optimum position of a BIPV facade depends upon season and that a south facing BIPV facade provides the greatest energy yield during winter months. The results also show how west-facing modules can significantly contribute to power generation during peak power periods (5–8 p.m.), which is imperative for balancing energy demand for buildings of the future and in particular supply the energy needs of buildings during peak hours in Northern Europe. Electrical characteristics under standard and part-load conditions were collated from laboratory scale OPV module experimental data and scaled for commercial-size modules in order to simulate BIPV arrays based upon OPVs. The simulated data is compared to experimental data and the closeness shows that BIPV systems based upon OPVs can be accurately simulated prior to installation. The system simulations compare typical energy demand profiles of small commercial buildings and illustrate that OPV arrays show strong potential to be used with excess energy generation for 8 months of the year based upon a 4.22kWp OPV system. Four 4.22kWp OPV systems scenarios have been investigated for (1) the highest annual energy generation, (2) architecturally evenly-spaced around the building (avoiding a North facade), (3) grid-balancing and (4) East-West split. Whilst Scenario 4 shows the lowest overall energy yield over the course of the year, energy production during peak hours is substantially higher than in other scenarios. The options presented show that OPVs are viable to use in BIPVs and can adequately meet the energy demand of a small commercial building during spring, summer and autumn in Norther Europe and can be adapted to end user's needs.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Facade; Energy demand; Performance ratio; Excess energy; Laboratory scale; Environmental science; Electricity generation; Cladding (fiber optics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2018.11.040,journal article,Bangor University,gb

1067,185-712-614-377-940,Conceptual design and performance evaluation of a hybrid concentrating photovoltaic system in preparation for energy,2018,"Concentrating sunlight and focussing it on smaller sized solar cells increases the device's power output per unit active area. However, this process tends to increase the solar cell temperature considerably and has the potential to compromise system reliability. Adding a heat exchanger system to regulate this temperature rise, can improve the electrical performance whilst simultaneously providing an additional source of low temperature heat. In this study the performance of a low concentrator photovoltaic system with thermal (LCPV/T) extraction was conceptualised and evaluated in depth. An experimental analysis was performed using a first-generation prototype consisting of 5 units of Cross Compound Parabolic Concentrators (CCPC) connected to a heat extraction unit. A bespoke rotating table was used as experimental apparatus to effectively evaluate the optical performance of the system, as a function of its angular positions to replicate the motion of actual sun. Key design performance parameters for the LCPV/T collector are presented and discussed. This work also provides a useful technique to effectively calculate system performance, as a function of the orientation-dependant electrical characterisation parameters data. Finally, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was also applied to investigate the efficacy of the heat exchanger and hence estimate the overall co-generation benefit of using such optimisation techniques on realistic CPV systems. It was highlighted through these simulations that the water flow rate had the potential to be a critical power-generation optimisation criterion for LCPV-T systems. The maximum power output at normal incidence with concentrators and no water flow was found to be 78.4 mW. The system was found to perform with an average electrical efficiency ranging between 10 and 16% when evaluated at five different geographic locations. Experimental analysis of the data obtained showed an increase in power of 141% (power ratio 2.41) compared to the analogous non-concentrating counterpart. For example, in the case of London which receives an annual solar radiation of 1300 kWh/m2 the system is expected to generate 210 kWh/m2. This may reduce further to include losses due to temperature, reflectance/glazing losses, and electrical losses in cabling and inverter by up to 36% leading to an annual power output of 134 kWh/m2 of module.",Heat exchanger; Maximum power principle; Electrical efficiency; Power (physics); Automotive engineering; Solar cell; Water flow; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Glazing,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.12.127,journal article,University of Exeter,gb

The present work is a part of a comprehensive framework toward the investigation of the lifetime durability of the BIPV modules. Therefore, this paper explain the development and validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to be later utilized to evaluate the temperature distribution of BIPV's surfaces under different arrangements and climate loadings. For this purpose, a high resolution 3D CFD model is firstly developed by generation of about 3 million cells. Then, the model is validated with a velocimetry experimental dataset from the same model tested in a wind tunnel experiment by [6] . Furthermore, the solar radiation is added into simulation to model the non-isothermal condition of the BIPV module. The non-isothermal case is further validated with a thermography observation conducted by [5] where a solar simulator is installed inside the tunnel.

However, fixed shading devices can reduce daylight availability, increase artificial light needs and block the beneficial winter solar radiation. This paper is part of a research on the characteristics of the optimum shading device. The aim is to investigate the balance between the energy needs for heating and cooling the space that the shading device is used for and the energy that is used for lighting the same space and the energy that the shading device can produce. In order to investigate the balance between the above mentioned parameters, thirteen types of fixed shading devices have been studied and categorized according to their energy performance, for a single occupant office room. The same office room is tested for two different Mediterranean latitudes in Athens and in Chania, Crete in Greece and for two different south facing windows’ sizes. The thermal behavior of the devices is assessed through computer simulation application and the daylight analysis is assessed with both computer simulation and physical modeling. Stable parameters were the internal loads in the office room, the south orientation of the facade and the type of glazing. Variable parameter was the type of the fixed shading device. The study shows that all shading devices with integrated south facing PV can efficiently produce electricity which may be used for lighting. The study highlights the fact that shading devices such as Surrounding shading, Brise–Soleil full facade and Canopy inclined double work efficiently against thermal and cooling loads and may be used to produce sufficient electricity and control daylight.

For this purpose, the spatial structure of the PV system including the PV modules and the surrounding obstacles is taken into account on the basis of virtual reality environment.

1077,099-653-154-119-531,New Designs of Building Integrated Solar Energy Systems,2014,"Abstract New solar energy systems with fixed concentrators have been designed to be integrated to buildings and adapt heat and electricity demand. The proposed systems are associated with less tracking requirements and the use of thermal, PV or hybrid PV/T absorbers. In some cases, an additional absorber can receive the diffuse radiation as well as the direct sunlight that is not captured by the main absorber. The simplest design mode of these systems is the flat absorber with flat reflector, which is static or movable to track solar radiation. A second design is the static parabolic or CPC reflector and a third one the Fresnel lens. These concentrators are combined with a primary linear absorber and tracking the converged beam solar radiation. The non-absorbed diffuse radiation and out of focus solar radiation is absorbed by a flat absorber, working as secondary absorber, so that the system to absorb almost all incident solar radiation. Thermal absorbers or photovoltaic strips can be mainly used as primary receivers, while for the concentrators, specular or diffuse reflectors can be applied in mirror type systems and linear Fresnel lenses in lens type systems. Fresnel lenses can be also used for solar control of building atria. In the paper the design and application aspects of the suggested new solar energy systems are presented.

PVs are a truly elegant means of producing electricity on site, directly from the sun, without concern for energy supply or environmental harm. They represent a favorable case: easy and fast installation, low maintenance requirements and the ability to produce electricity on site within the urban built environment. In that sense, there is a growing consensus that PVs for individual buildings, known as building integrated or applied PVs (BIPVs or BAPVs, respectively), will be chief among the continuously widespread distributed PV applications. Still, they suffer from the disadvantage of their very high initial cost compared to other renewable and conventional energy technologies, although this has been steadily reduced during the last 5 years.

Plenty of studies have proposed the use of a Life Cycle Assessment methodology, to determine the environmental impact of renewable installations when coupled with storage solutions, based on a pre-selected repository of Key Performance Indicators. The main scope of this paper is to propose a limited number of best fitting, and at the same time easily adaptable to various configurations, list of Key Performance Indicators for the case of renewable energy systems. This is done by capitalizing on the environmental and energy performance indicators tracked in the open literature (e.g. “Global Warming Potential”, “Energy Payback Time”, “Battery Total Degradation”, “Energy Stored on Invested”, “Cumulative Energy Demand”) and/or other proposing new simple, scalable and adaptable ones, (e.g. “Embodied Energy for Infrastructure of Materials and for the building system”, “Life Cycle CO2 Emissions”, “Reduction of the Direct CO2 emissions”, “Avoided CO2 Emissions”, “CO2 equivalent Payback Time”). Moreover, the proposed indicators are distributed according to the individual phases of the entire life-cycle of a related component of a renewable energy system, each time the environmental impact refers to, i.e. manufacturing, operational and end-of-life. Apart from that, the current paper presents a necessary base grounded approach, which can be followed for a holistic approach in environmental point of view of renewable-based technologies, by addressing the potential competing interests of the relevant stakeholders (e.g. profit for the market operator in contrast to low-cost services for the consumer). All in all, the scalar quantification of the environmental impact of multiple energy systems, through a list of proposed assessment criteria, being evaluated in terms of the selected repository of indicators, enables the comparison on a fair basis of the available energy systems, irrespective if they are fossil-fuel or renewable based ones.

The model was developed for partial hot-spot situation and for serial cell connection. The developed 3D model uses a novel approach via two-way coupling of thermal and electrical models. The model was experimentally validated for geographical location of Mediterranean climate, using the readings from temperature sensors, as well as thermal imaging data. The comparison of results between measured and simulated values were shown to be well matched, with deviation not more than 1.5 °C.

For the practical realisation of LSC technology, the ability to create large area devices, which contain considerable volumes of high quality luminescent species, is paramount. Here, we report the development of large area (90 cm2 top face), planar LSCs doped with green-emitting CdSe@ZnS/ZnS core–shell quantum dots (QD) with a composition gradient shell. The champion LSC demonstrates an optical efficiency of 1.2%, for a geometric factor of 7.9, under full spectrum illumination (AM1.5G). It was observed that inhomogeneity in the edge emission is a feature of large area devices and that an appropriate measurement geometry should be used to account for this when determining the optical efficiency. The LSCs exhibit excellent optical stability under accelerated testing conditions and display reasonably low optical reabsorption losses. Proof-of-principle integration of the QD-LSC with a planar, thin strip DSSC is demonstrated to generate an enhanced photocurrent. These results not only highlight the promise of composition gradient shell QDs for the practical realisation of large area LSCs, but indicate that we should look beyond conventional silicon cells and towards emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies for the design of hybrid LSC-PV systems for the urban environment.",Quantum dot; Planar; Luminescence; Materials science; Photocurrent; Photovoltaic system; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Optoelectronics; Silicon; Doping,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta04731b,journal article,University College Dublin,ie

By allowing daylight, visual comfort inside a building is possible which can enhance the occupant’s health, mood and cognitive performance. However, traditional highly transparent windows should be replaced with semitransparent type window to attain a comfortable daylight inside a building. Evaluation of visual comfort includes both daylight glare and colour comfort analysis. Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) type windows are promising systems and can possess a range of semitransparent levels depending on the type of PV used. In this work, the semitransparent Perovskite BIPV windows was investigated by employing daylight glare analysis for an office building located in Riyadh, KSA and three wavelength dependent transmission spectra for colour comfort analysis. The results showed that the transmissions range between 50–70% was optimum for the comfortable daylight for south facing vertical pane BPV-windows. However, excellent colour comfort was attained for the transmission range of 90% which provided glare issues.

LSC technology works by trapping incident solar radiation, converting the spectrum to the wavelength-band of interest and concentrating the light by total internal reflection (TIR) to the edge of the LSC where photovoltaic (PV) solar cell is attached. During the waveguiding process of solar radiation, a considerable proportion of photons are lost through mechanisms such as re-absorption, attenuation, scattering and escape cone losses which decrease the device optical efficiency (OE). In recent decades, various LSC generations with different configurations have been introduced and investigated to mitigate the inherent optical losses and enhance the device performance. Due to the achieved optical improvements, LSC has recently captured a significant growing interest implying its leading role as a low cost and passive technology for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PV systems. In this paper, large and small scale LSCs have been comprehensively reviewed to study the impact of device configuration (such as shape, geometric gain, host material, luminescent species, doping concentration and PV solar cell type) on the LSC loss mechanisms and optical performance.

Performance enhancement of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels by passive cooling has been investigated both experimentally and with computational modeling. It has been shown that mounting the BIPV with a narrow channel can reduce the operating temperature of the photovoltaic panel. This enhancement in the heat transfer from the PV panel results in decreasing the average temperature of the PV panel from 5 to 10 °C. Results show that having a 30 cm channel beneath the panel can increase the electrical output by 3–4%. This increase in PV output can translate into a significant amount over the life cycle of a given PV module. Various channel aspect ratios have been tested in order to correlate the enhancement in performance to the cooling channel geometry.

This report focuses on optimization of a contoured FPV array which operates under Non Uniform Illumination (NUI) conditions. NUI conditions can occur at low solar angle for contoured layouts and also due to unexpected partial shading events. The output Power Voltage (P-V) characteristics under contouring and partial shading demonstrate severe oscillatory behavior around the maximum power region, which results in inefficient implementation of established tracking algorithms that seek to detect a dominant global maxima. An algorithm for MPP tracking has been proposed that takes into account both static and dynamic parameters. An integrated test system has been developed which can accurately monitor solar irradiance (range 100–1000 Watts/m2) and solar angle and load dependent instantaneous output voltage and current.

While solar represents the most ubiquitous energy source, its appropriate harnessing mechanism requires a careful approach and design. Amid the various direct and indirect electricity generation techniques available, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) carries immense potential to harness solar energy integrated as a component of the building envelope. It is an onsite-distributed power source, offering advantages of size and scale variability, modularity and building integrability. To be energy efficient as a building envelope, BIPV would need to passively regulate the responsiveness of the building envelope to the external environment to accomplish the prime function of a building, i.e. to provide (natural) indoor thermal-comfort for conducive and productive living. However, the requirements for climate-responsive building design may infringe upon those required for optimal PV performance. Besides technological considerations attributed to varying PV (material-dependent) performance efficiencies and high initial investment, a pragmatic approach should also integrate social, environmental and economic factors for successful adoption of a BIPV.

The performance of any given BIPV system is dependent on prevalent meteorological factors, site conditions and system characteristics. Investigations pertaining to the performance assessment of photovoltaic (PV) systems are generally confined to either controlled environment-chambers or computer-based simulation studies. Such investigations fall short of providing a realistic insight into how a PV system actually performs real-time. Solar radiation and the PV cell temperature are amongst the most crucial parameters affecting PV output. The current paper deals with the real-time performance assessment of a recently commissioned 5.25 kW, BIPV system installed at the Center for Sustainable Technologies, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The overall average system efficiency was found to be 6% for the period May 2011-April 2012.

BIPV comprises building envelope elements (wall, facade, fenestration) of PV while BAPV comprises PV applied on/in building elements. The uniqueness in this configuration lies in PV system design requiring maximum exposure to solar insolation, while building elements are designed to control and regulate solar exposure. PV performance is primarily governed by its output and efficiency, while building performance is primarily governed by its passive climatic-response, indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption. Integrability is a methodology evolved to aid in assessing a BIPV/BAPV configuration for its integrated building-Pvperformance. Tropical regions are gifted with ample sunny days, but due to the heat from the sun traditionally buildings have relied on high thermal-mass, shading devices and natural ventilation. However, with low-thermal mass in PV, its integration in buildings as BIPV results in high heat gain and loss, while integration as BAPV results in shading and altered building-heat transfer mechanisms. The current paper investigates the applicability of BIPV and BAPV, adopting the evolved integrability methodology, for tropical conditions, with Bangalore as case-study.

One such possibility is through Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics (BIPV) and improving energy efficient features through passive solar design in the buildings. The research team has studied two design cases, an existing building of 2011.12 m2 and a new building of 100 m2 ground area suitable for BIPV installation in Central Gujarat region of Western India. The paper includes literature review on type of field data required, parameters for energy efficient buildings, and estimation of solar energy generation on buildings, techno-economic analysis and feasibility of BIPV. The team's analysis on both cases reveal that BIPV retrofitting in existing building is found to be expensive over designing a building with BIPV as pre-thought. Also BIPV modules produced excellent architectural form and enhanced overall aesthetics of the building. The BIPV as pre-thought has been found to be cost effective since they just not act as energy producer, but also reduces the cost of building materials it replaces. Taking into consideration, the multi-beneficial nature of BIPV, we estimate the pay-back period to be 5-15 years depending upon the type of connection (Grid-connected or Stand-alone), amount of energy replacement by BIPV and the existing Government policies and incentives.

This work represents review of the flat-plate building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) system, including current developments, experimental and numerical studies and parametric effect on the building performance. Flat-plate BIPV/T system reviewed here are: air-based system, water-based system and hybrid system in which, nano fluid, phase change material, cushion structure and heat pipe etc. are covered. From the study it is found that Performance of BIPV/T depends on design parameters and local weather condition. Also, more thermal energy is obtained by BIPV/water system as compared to BIPV/air system. This work provides overview of research, development, application and status of system. From most of the studies of BIPV/T systems and facades it has been observed that the variation of thermal efficiency is in the range of 22–55% for air-based systems and 30–60% for water-based systems. Further the electrical efficiency variation is in the range of 10–18% for air-based systems and 10–17% for water-based systems. It has been observed that the variation of thermal efficiency increases upto a mass flow rate of 0.1 kg/s after which the change is marginal to justify for thermal gain. Also, the electrical efficiency remains nearly unchanged at all mass flow rates.

Our aim is to minimize the accidents by creating an efficient communication system. Methods/Statistical Analysis: In our proposed system, we have used light as the carrier to create a fast and reliable communication system where OOK modulation technique is used, unlike other systems where RF is used. The LED’s are positioned in the headlights and taillights of the car which also contain the photodetector to receive light signal. The circuitry have designed and simulated in PROTEUS. Findings: It was found that by replacing all the windows of the car with BIPV, the system can run independently. Theoretically it can work up to 20m with a low bit error rate and this can be achieved by using an array of LED’s or increasing the intensity of the LED. It was observed that by hindering the intensity of the LED, the range decreased and hence the validity of the relation between Intensity of LED and range was established. It was found that the data from individual cars were being transmitted immediately with no delay.

One of such solutions are Integrated Facade Systems (IFS), which deploy different technologies in or related to building facades to improve building performance. To measure the efficiency of such solutions, three broad categories of methods are in use, namely real, scaled or mock physical models, mathematical models and simulations of which the latter is the most time- and cost-efficient and depending on the platform can provide the most user-friendly method. The flexibility, ease of use and broader coverage of Building Energy Simulation (BES) tools make them a more viable alternative. Developing a benchmark or a base-case model against which the impact of parametric changes of the IFS can be measured is the first step in BES and bares high importance on methodological reliability and validity of the results. This paper uses a specially devised methodology to develop a base-case model for BES of highly- to fully-glazed office buildings in hot and arid climates. BES results of the energy production of the base-case and over 1600 parametric combinations of the model’s system and sub-system levels variables have been used to perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results.

Unlike fossil fuel, renewable energy does not pollute the environment because it is a part of nature. Renewable sources that are most often used are solar, wind, water (hydropower), biomass and geothermal energy. The potential to generate energy from renewable sources is largely dependent on the availability of these natural resources. Among the renewable energy resources, the energy through the photovoltaic (PV) – which converts the sunlight directly into electricity – can be considered the most essential and prerequisite sustainable resource. The standalone PV system cannot provide a continuous supply of energy due to seasonal and periodic variations. Therefore, in order to satisfy the load demand, grid-connected energy systems are now being implemented that combine the PV system with the grid system. The gridconnected PV system can be divided into two parts: building integrated PV systems (BIPV) and distribution generation PV (DGPV) systems. BIPV systems usually supply a specific load and inject the excess energy to the grid while DGPV systems directly inject the energy to the grid. The suggestion in this paper is that the BIPV system is applied for some special building in a Koya city like: the university’s new presidency building, Shaid-Khalid new hospital and the new bank buildings.

The excess heat could lower the overall module efficiency. Therefore, seeking methods of reducing PV cell’s heat gain could potentially enhance the overall module performance. One such method, is to incorporate Phase Change Materials (PCM), which could also be integrated with other heat rejection methods. In this paper, a building-integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPVT) system comprising a PCM layer as well a gap for airflow beneath the PCM layer is numerically investigated. For comparison purposes, four commercial PCM types were selected, namely RT18HC, RT21, RT21HC, and RT25HC. For each PCM, the cell temperature, overall module’s efficiency, and the unit output airflow temperature was investigated. Furthermore, the effect of PCM layer thickness on the aforementioned system performance criteria was also analyzed. The effect of solar intensity apart from the ambient temperature on the module performance was assessed in advance as a novel approach. It was revealed that for a specific layer thickness, incorporating RT18HC, which has the highest latent heat of fusion among the PCMs, yielded the lowest PV temperature, lowest output airflow temperature, and highest PV efficiency. At 1:00 p.m. and for 50 mm of PCM layer thickness, the PV efficiency of the system with RT18HC was improved by 1.71% as compared to the module with RT21. In addition, it was shown that the PCM layer thickness has an optimum value in improving the system performance. Increasing the thickness beyond the optimum value did not yield significant enhancement. For RT18HC, the optimum layer thickness acquired to be 120 mm.

The selected cities are Stavanger in Norway, Bern in Switzerland, Rome in Italy, and Dubai in the UAE. The study showed that for all the studied climates, the average incident radiation on the entire building skins is slightly more than the average incident radiation on the east or west facades, regardless of the orientations of the building facades. Furthermore, the correlation between solar radiation components and different BIPV technologies is discussed in this paper. It is also found that when it comes to the efficiency of different BIPV cells, the impact of the climate on some of the BIPV technologies (such as DSC and OSC) is much more significant than others (such as c-Si, mc-Si and CIGS). The evidence from this study suggests that in climates with higher diffuse radiation-or with more overcast days per year-the contribution of IR radiation decreases. Therefore, the efficiency of BIPV materials that their spectral responses are dependent on the IR radiation (like Si and CIGS) in such a climate would drop down meaningfully. On the other hand, the DSC and OSC solar cells could be a good option for cloudy climates since they have more stable performance, even in such a climate.

In addition, an incentive mechanism was designed to encourage volunteer customers to change their consumption patterns based on the presented energy labeling structure. The incentive mechanism is flexible and can be changed by the system operator considering the energy label variation. Different practical methods, which included the economic heat and electrical demands model, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), and building integrated plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), were evaluated to promote the energy label of the residential building. For practical implementation, the proposed structure was applied to a sample smart residential building in East-Azerbaijan of Iran, and it was solved using GAMS software. The numerical results based on realistic data validated the effectiveness of the presented practical methods within the framework of the introduced energy labeling structure. According to the obtained results, the energy label index of the selected test system was promoted from F to E in the presence of the economic demand model and PHEV and promoted to D by using the economic demand model and BIPV system. In addition, the amount of energy injected into the building was decreased by up to 2.52% through the economic demand and PHEV schemes and up to 17.22% in the presence of the BIPV system.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Consumption (economics); Energy (signal processing); Efficient energy use; Electric vehicle; Energy consumption; Incentive; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Economic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121059,journal article,University of Tabriz,ir
1165,049-098-212-948-44X,Optimal Window to Wall Ratio Ranges of Photovoltachromic Windows in High-Rise Office Buildings of Iran,2021,"<jats:p>Windows are one of the weakest building components concerning high thermal losses. Traditional windows cannot adapt to external and internal environmental conditions. On the other hand, smart windows such as electrochromic (EC) windows do not emit greenhouse gases and adapt to environmental conditions and increase indoor environmental quality. The combination of EC windows and building integrated photovoltaic system (BIPV) is called photovoltachromic (PVC) windows. This paper aims to find optimal window to wall ratio (WWR) ranges of PVC windows in a high-rise office building model in four different cities in Iran. This paper uses several simulations to find the optimal WWR ranges of PVC windows using Radiance and EnergyPlus. First, the minimum acceptable WWR value in each climate condition was identified using several simulations without any optimization tools. Afterward, traditional windows were replaced with EC windows and results indicated that energy consumption of the building reduced up to 15.94%. In the next stage, BIPV was combined with EC windows, and results indicated that BIPV reduced energy consumption of the building up to 7.55%. Finally, simulation results showed that PVC windows reduced energy consumption of the building up to 16.31% in Kermanshah, 19.69% in Tehran, 18.59% in Yazd and 17.36% in Bandar Abbas. Also, the optimal WWR range of PVC windows in Kermanshah was 80-90%, while it was 70-80% in Tehran, Yazd and Bandar Abbas. Simulation results indicated that cooling degree days (CDD) of the site, where buildings were located, effected on the optimal WWR range of PVC windows in high-rise office buildings. An analytical approach was used to validate simulation results, and it showed that simulation results had 1.60-6.22% error.</jats:p>",,http://dx.doi.org/10.15627/jd.2021.10,journal article,Razi University,ir
1166,051-483-098-281-751,"Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) in Europe, Rational Feed-In Tariffs and Subsidies",2021,"Building integrated photovoltaics is one of the key technologies when it comes to electricity generation in buildings, districts or urban areas. However, the potential of building facades for the BIPV system, especially in urban areas, is often neglected. Facade-mounted building integrated photovoltaics could contribute to supply the energy demand of buildings in dense urban areas with economic feasibility where the availability of suitable rooftop areas is low. This paper deals with the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) in the capitals of all the European member state countries plus Norway and Switzerland and presents a metric to investigate a proper subsidy or incentive for BIPV systems. The results showed that the average LCOE of the BIPV system as a building envelope material for the entire outer skin of buildings in Europe is equal to 0.09 Euro per kWh if its role as the power generator is considered in the economic calculations. This value will be 0.15 Euro per kWh if the cost corresponding to its double function in the building is taken into the economic analysis (while the average electricity price is 0.18 Euro per kWh). The results indicate that the BIPV generation cost in most case studies has already reached grid parity. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that on average in Europe, the BIPV system does not need a feed-in tariff if the selling price to the grid is equal to the purchasing price from the grid. Various incentive plans based on the buying/selling price of electricity from/to the main grid together with LCOE of the BIPV systems is also investigated.",Feed-in tariff; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Business; Grid parity; Building envelope; Electricity; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Cost of electricity by source,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14092531,journal article,Amirkabir University of Technology,ir

This BIPV/T-TW system has two main operating modes, namely winter and summer. The exhaust air is used for pre-heating and pre-cooling the ambient fresh air through a TW in the winter and summer modes of operation, respectively. Besides, the pre-heated fresh air (in the winter mode) and the heated exhaust air (in the summer mode) is used for reducing the temperature of PV panels and consequently improving their electrical efficiency. The electrical and thermal performance of the system is calculated and compared with those of the conventional BIPV/T and TW systems. Besides, a performance evaluation criterion (PEC) is defined in this study to investigate the overall performance of the studied systems. The results shows that the BIPV/T-TW system has higher PEC than the BIPV/T and TW systems.

Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) schemes cannot be applied to this section of a BIPVS because the output current of the PV panel is determined only by the state of charge (SOC) of the batteries bank which is the sole load of the PV panel in this section. In this study, a novel scheme is proposed to increase the energy efficiency of this section of a BIPVS. For the first time, it is shown that the energy efficiency of the PV-converter-battery section of a BIPVS is effectively increased by decomposing its PV panel into a set of parallel homogenous configured PV modules. Theoretical results obtained using the Lambert W function as a mathematical tool are presented that indicate parallel homogenous configured PV modules produce higher output power compared to all other configurations. Simulated results performed in MATLAB and PROTEUS environments are presented that explicitly validate the obtained theoretical results and verify an increase of about 10% in the energy efficiency of the PV-converter-battery section.

1175,118-795-238-011-73X,A novel method for optimal performance of ships by simultaneous optimisation of hull-propulsion-BIPV systems,2019,"Abstract Shipping has been facing significant challenges due to strict limits imposed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to become more environmentally sustainable. In this regard, the use of solar energy, as a viable way to deal with the pollutant emissions caused by ships, has been attracted considerable attention. However, considerable investment costs, high area demands, and low performances of ships equipped with the photovoltaic systems have until recently been some of the significant challenges in the use of solar energy in the shipping industry. This paper proposes a novel method for the optimal performance of ships through the simultaneous optimisation of the hull-propulsion-building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system. Using the proposed method, the interaction effects among the ship hull, the BIPV system, and the propulsion system, as well as the impact of the wind and ship speeds on the BIPV system efficiency are considered. Ship operational conditions, including the sunshine duration, the clearness index, the ambient temperature, the latitude of the region, the view factor of the sky to ground, the wind and ship speeds, and the ship lifetime hour are also examined. Moreover, a probabilistic speed profile is employed to avoid a suboptimal design at a single ship speed. The performance of the suggested method is evaluated by designing a planing ship equipped with a waterjet propulsion system that operates in the Karun river, Iran. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem of a planing hull-waterjet-BIPV system. Eight cases are compared to demonstrate the effectiveness and the promise of the proposed approach in different ship design problems with different displacements and BIPV area-to-deck area ratios. The results show the high performance of the adopted approach in cutting operating costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Based on the results, the investment costs due to the BIPV system have been recouped within a year in different studied cases and scenarios. It is also found out that the interaction effects among the ship hull, the BIPV system, and the propulsion system are important to ensure the optimal performance of a ship.",Propulsion; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Marine engineering; Hull; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Greenhouse gas; Probabilistic logic; Solar energy; Naval architecture,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111879,journal article,Amirkabir University of Technology,ir

Indeed porphyrins are characterized by strong electronic absorption bands in the visible region up to the near infrared and by long-lived * singlet excited states. Moreover the presence of four meso and eight -pyrrolic positions allows a fine tuning of their photoelectrochemical properties through structural modification.

However, it was also shown that even though there is a considerable support for policies promoting renewable energy at a general level, local communities often perceive the installation of systems powered by renewable sources such as limiting the quality of life, or impacting on the natural and built landscape. Consequently, the studies concerning the procedures for assessing the territorial and landscape impacts of this type of systems have recently seen a remarkable development. If an extensive scientific literature is now available regarding the assessment of visual impact of wind turbines, with applications in several countries, there are few studies, theoretical or applied, dealing with the visual impact of photovoltaic plants, which represent, also for their physical size, an important form of transformation of the agricultural and forestry land. As part of studies conducted by the authors regarding the territorial impacts of photovoltaic plant, in this paper, a procedure to evaluate the visual impact of a PV plant based on a quantitative indicator and that was published in the same journal (vol. 13, no. 5, p. 986–99) is adopted and discussed with reference to the application on some case studies. As a result, some modifications to the procedure are presented and a discussion on how this procedure may be used and integrated into the administrative requirements of large and small scale PV plants developments is carried out.

EPBD requires that all new buildings have to reach the objective to be nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEBs) by 2020. The concept of nZEBs focuses on firstly improving the energy performance of the building envelope and, then, integrating Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) to cover the remaining energy demand. In this context, photovoltaic (PV) systems provide a reliable solution for electricity supply either in existing or new buildings. Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems have the twofold advantage of increasing the prospects of renewable energy in the built environment, whilst providing savings in materials and construction time by replacing traditional building elements. Recently, bifacial PV cells have attracted interest because of their potential to increase PV modules power production. Integration of bifacial PV modules into a building facade represents a significant step forward in the application of this relatively new technology. Such facade can serve not only as a renewable source of electricity acting as an active system but also it contributes to reducing the building cooling needs acting as a passive system. In this paper, a multilayer one-dimension dynamic thermal model of monofacial glass-back sheet and bifacial glass-glass PV modules integrated into a building facade is presented.

The study, which considers only the electricity produced by the PV systems that are economically profitable, highlighted that the tax credits scheme is even more effective in covering the electrical consumption of densely urbanised Italian city districts.

1184,022-953-523-810-629,β-Substituted ZnII porphyrins as dyes for DSSC: A possible approach to photovoltaic windows,2018,"Abstract The development of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology and its implementation in construction of the building envelop provide aesthetical, economical and technical solutions toward the zero-energy building. In this perspective dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which can be obtained in transparent form and with tunable different colors, offer not only an alternative to the traditional silicon solar cells to be applied in particular to decorative effects on windows and glass integrated facades, but also to indoor structures (and furnishings) in order to recapture the energy spent for the inner lighting, thanks to their peculiar ability of operating in diffuse light condition. In this context, porphyrin-based molecules have an immense potential as light harvesting component of dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells, reaching now efficiencies up to about 13%. However the multistep synthesis of the best performing porphyrin dyes, showing a meso substitution pattern, is characterized by very low overall yields compromising their possible applicative development for instance in large photovoltaic (PV) glass modules in competition with the actual commercial PV glass modules based on CuInGaSe2 or CdTe thin voltaic films. In this review the renewed interest in the role of the β-substituted ZnII porphyrins for PV application, less studied than the meso substituted ones, is highlighted. Indeed they can rely on a more accessible synthetic procedure since their tetraaryl porphyrinic core can be easily obtained by a one pot reaction between pyrrole and the appropriate aryl aldehyde. Moreover, their remarkable light harvesting properties in the visible range as well as their peculiar steric hindrance, which strongly opposes to the charge recombination process at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface, make this kind of cost-effective porphyrinic dyes more promising for application in new PV glass modules based on DSSC technology, to be applied BIPV.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Nanotechnology; Chemistry; Porphyrin; Context (language use); Photovoltaic system; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Silicon; Cadmium telluride photovoltaics; Diffuse reflection,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2017.12.012,journal article,University of Milan,it
1185,026-951-078-933-677,The PV potential of South Tyrol: an Intelligent Use of Space,2014,"Abstract Recently, the local government of South Tyrol, a province in the alpine area in the north of Italy, has defined the guidelines for an energy and climate package with targets for 2050 where it is stated that - The yearly CO 2 emission per capita will be reduced to less than 1.5 tons (less than 4 tons per capita by 2020 as intermediate target) - 90% of the energy need will be covered by renewables (at least 75% by 2020 as intermediate target). Specifically, energy production from photovoltaics will contribute towards those targets with a total installed power of 300 MW by 2020 (around 0.6 kW per capita considering population as of 2012) and 600 MW by 2050 (around 1.2 kW per capita considering population as of 2012). These figures start from a baseline of PV installed power in the province at the end of 2012 of 220 MW (around 0.45 kW per capita, around 0.28 kW per capita in Italy for comparison). Although both targets seem easily within reach, it is nonetheless important to lay the right foundation through favourable legislation and long term planning. It is within these context that a detailed analysis of the real PV potential (as comprehensive and effectively exploitable) of the area is proposed so to understand how ambitious those targets really are and to provide data and information for future energy and strategy planning. In this work, in an innovative approach, the impact of novel solutions on non-conventional surfaces were also included such as PV installations on transport infrastructure, avalanche barriers, artificial lakes, etc. High altitude installations were also taken into account due to the high irradiance values in the alpine area which are comparable to those in South of Italy (up to 2200 kWh/m 2 per year). Limitations due to costs, phasing out of generous incentives programs, restrictive laws (for instance, architectural and environmental constraints) were considered, too. The different technical aspects will be presented from the use of existing solar cadastres and databases to statistical analysis based on the morphology of different urban contexts. The roof (and facade) potential will then be added to the potential from the above mentioned non-conventional surfaces with the final aim of providing a figure for PV potential that takes into account planning permissions, restrictions, structural limitations, current legislation, visual impact and costs.",Baseline (configuration management); Engineering; Per capita; Natural resource economics; Work (electrical); Renewable energy; Context (language use); Population; Incentive; Strategic planning; Environmental protection,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.10.130,journal article,"EURAC Research, Viale Druso 1, 39100, Bolzano, Italy",it

The c-Si or a-Si PV cannot fully satisfy aesthetic requirements as transparency and colouring, and facing problems as poor irradiation, shading and temperatures. Among the new generation PV, Perovskite solar cell technology reached top efficiencies in a few years together with a low-cost perspective. Different strategies related to the Perovskite layer (thickness, morphology, mesh-structure, band-gap tuning) and to alternative top-electrodes can be implemented to achieve the semi-transparent feature for BIPV applications. Here the stable triple cation CsMAFA Perovskite is used for the first time in literature to realize a semi-transparent module (about 90% geometrical fill factor) with a highly transparent sputtered ITO top-electrode. The optical and electrical characterizations of the device show an average visible transmittance (AVT) equal to 10% on the module full stack and area, and an efficiency more than 8%.

This patented innovative component is able to merge structural function, insulation proprieties, and production of clean energy for retrofit actions and/or the construction of translucent facades in high-rise buildings located in different climatic contexts. Due to colored PV cells integrated into 3 Dimensional (3D) glass components and the dry-assembly system used for assembling them into precast and pre-stressed panels, an easy and creative customization of the product is allowed. Green energy production, safety, and energy efficiency of buildings can be assured in accordance with the environmental conditions and users’ needs. The pre-stressing force used to improve the mechanical resistance of the panel toward horizontal forces due to winds and earthquakes guarantees the construction of secure translucent and active building envelopes. The paper summarizes the features of this innovative and patented BIPV product by focusing on its mechanical behavior. Laboratory tests are described and commented for underlining the benefits derived from the use of the dry-assembly system and of the supporting structure made of plastic for the construction of the panels. Bending and breaking strength tests have been carried out on two sq.m of panel prototypes, which have been dry-assembled through a supporting structure made of Polypropylene (PP) in order to compare the results with the theoretical calculations derived from the Finite Element (FE) simulations.

At equal charge transfer resistances (RCT), the superior transparency of electrodeposited (ED) Pt:CoS compared to ED Pt-only and ED CoS-only was attributed to the synergic combination of a very thin CoS layer and a fine dispersion of Pt nanoparticles. The highly catalytic properties of Pt:CoS with less electrodeposited material consumption, carried out at room temperature, can represent a fast and energy saving fabrication process, also compatible with flexible plastic substrates. In fact, DSCs with the ED Pt:CoS counterelectrodes showed the highest power conversion efficiency in back illumination, which is the configuration used for flexible metallic and bifacial DSCs during operation, gaining on average almost 14% and 7% in device efficiency with respect to ED CoS-only and ED Pt-only based cells.

The investigation regards a real multi-storey apartment block, representative of a significant amount of edifices built in Italy in 1950–1990, which often need refurbishment because of obsolescence. This building type is generally well suited to receive a new double-skin facade, supporting both PV and other common cladding materials, while also representing a good compromise in terms of aesthetic quality, cost, weight, durability and ease of maintenance. In order to make general conclusions, a parametric analysis is performed, by virtually changing the orientation, the number of floors and the climatic conditions, and by considering different PV technologies. The results show that for an 8-storey building with the main axis along E-W, the initial investment can be repaid within around nine years, if considering the current fiscal incentives and a 50% self-consumption rate for the electricity produced by the PV modules. The presence of fiscal incentives is essential to make the investment attractive. Better PV efficiencies, lower prices and higher self-consumption rates can enhance the economic profitability, which may generate a significant impact on the retrofit of European multi-storey residential stock. These results can be effectively extended to the PV integration on the facades of new apartment blocks too.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Profitability index; Civil engineering; Architectural engineering; Electricity; Economic evaluation; Double-skin facade; Apartment; Facade; Obsolescence,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.08.085,journal article,University of Catania,it

The method finds capacity and position of a photovoltaic system over the envelope of a building by means of optimization. The input consists in: geometry of the building, surrounding shadings, local weather, hourly electric demand, unitary costs of the system and benefits for the production of electricity (sold or self-consumed). In the input there are known values (e.g. PV installation costs [€/kWp] or present costs for the electricity [€/kWh]) and unknown ones (e.g. degradation rate [%/year], maintenance costs [€/kWp year] or discount rate [%/year]). The optimization is performed using the expected value out of a set of parametric scenarios generated by the unknown input values. The results show that, if capacity and position of the system are tailored on its aggregated electric demand, a large penetration of photovoltaic electricity is profitable at current prices without incentives or valorization from the grid. The optimization performed with an arbitrary set of electric storages shows how the presence of storage fosters a higher optimal capacity for the PV system.

PV producers often declare a higher efficiency respect to real conditions and this deviation is mainly due to the difference between nominal and real temperature conditions of the PV. In order to improve the solar cell energy conversion efficiency many authors have proposed a methodology to keep the temperature of a PV system lower: a modified crystalline PV system built with a normal PV panel coupled with a Phase Change Material (PCM) heat storage device. In this paper a thermal model analysis of the crystalline PV-PCM system based on a theoretical study using finite difference approach is described. The authors developed an algorithm based on an explicit finite difference formulation of energy balance of the crystalline PV-PCM system. Two sets of recursive equations were developed for two types of spatial domains: a boundary domain and an internal domain. The reliability of the developed model is tested by a comparison with data coming from a test facility.

Simulations show that, considering one single day, ventilation of the modules could enhance the power production of 3.5%. In order to verify the correspondence between simulations and monitored values, a comparison considering one single day was carried out: the mathematical model used by the software for simulations, manages to predict the PV array irradiation and the average temperature of the modules with good accuracy (respectively -2% and +0.2%), while the power production is strongly underestimated (-20%).This could be due to several reasons that are discussed in the paper.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Meteorology; Power (physics); Ventilation (architecture); Software; Facade; Northern italy; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system,https://www.eupvsec-proceedings.com/proceedings?paper=7292,conference article,Eurac Research,it

To adapt such transformation trend, this paper optimizes the cost-optimal capacity and positions of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) in a small residential district in Sweden, by considering thermal-electricity loads, power sharing among neighbour buildings, and electrical storage. This study focuses on two optimization scenarios with two different objectives: (1) maximizing net present value (NPV) of the BIPV system, and (2) achieving 27% renewable energy sources (RES) (as set by EU Framework for climate and energy).The optimization is performed with varying penetration of EV demand. The results show that: in scenario (1) the increase in EVs enables larger BIPV capacity with slightly improved self-consumption and thus with a little more profit. In scenario (2) however the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the self-consumed electricity sensibly increases with growing presence of EVs, leading to the decreased profit. In conclusion, three main factors were found that are negatively affecting the performance of BIPV in relation to the EVs in the Swedish residential sector: A low electricity price in summer, a prevalence of the EV load at night, and the absence of PV over-production in winter.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Net present value; Profit (economics); Renewable energy; Electricity; Residential sector; Environmental science; Photovoltaics; Cost of electricity by source,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/609/7/072066,journal article,University of Trento,it

It is thus essential to properly evaluate and compare the PV temperature conditions of different PV module categories (in terms of PV technology and material type). Several explicit correlations exist for the evaluation of the PV module temperature, among which the simplest and most handy is a linear expression (i.e. T mod =T amb +k G ) which links T mod with the ambient temperature ( T amb ) and the incident solar radiation flux ( G ). Within this expression the value of the dimensional parameter k , known as the Ross coefficient, depends on several aspects (i.e. module type, wind velocity and integration characteristics). However, dispersed values for this parameter can be found in literature (in the range of 0.02-0.06 K m 2 /W) according to different module types, while more information are provided regarding different integration characteristics. This paper aims at giving an overview of the value of k for different module types according to monitored data registered over one year time period at the ABD-PV plant in Bolzano (Italy). The highest values of k , which means the highest module temperature at a certain G , are registered for the three glass-glass (G-G) module types ( k Tmod,c from 0.033 K m 2 /W to 0.037 K m 2 /W). The glass-tedlar (G-T) module types operate at slight lower temperature values ( k Tmod,c ranging from 0.029 K m 2 /W to 0.032 K m 2 /W).",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Topology; Engineering; Type (model theory); Wind speed; Building envelope; Range (statistics); Electronic engineering; Value (computer science); Photovoltaic system; Radiation flux,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.02.148,journal article,"EURAC, Viale Druso 1, Bolzano 39100, Italy",it

Many typologies of BIPV have been developed, however their thermal characteristics such as g and Ug-value are not well evaluated and require more detailed analyses considering that they could replace large extension of traditional building envelope. A first approach to address this problem is proposed in this work. A mathematical model based on a finite differences scheme for the estimation of the thermal parameters g and Ug-value has been developed and tuned using experimental value measured on sample BIPV with a Hot Plate and a Solar Calorimeter.

In developing countries like Kenya with a high rate of urbanization, this transition requires urban and rural residents’ proactive responses to using renewable energy sources. In this regard, a better understanding of residents’ perceptions about renewable energy investment, RE sources availability, climate change, environmental conservation and other factors can lead to more efficient and sustainable implementation of renewable energy policies. This study investigates the role Kenya’s household energy consumers in urban and rural areas can play in adopting renewable energy technologies. To achieve this, a questionnaire survey was administered among 250 household consumers in Nairobi County, Makueni County, and Uasin Gishu County. Our survey analysis shows that about 84% of the respondents were interested in adopting renewable energy for their entire energy consumption mostly because of solving frequent power outages and high energy cost from the grid system. This perception did not have any correlations with income levels or any other socio-economic factors we identified. Furthermore, about 72% of the respondents showed their interests in producing and selling renewable energy to the national or local grids if government subsidies were readily available. Rural residents showed strong interests in adopting renewable energy technologies, especially solar PV solutions.

In this study, the relationship between the output improvement with reconnection and the switching interval is shown. For a 3-kW PV system, under conditions of cloudlessness and cloudiness, a sharp difference in the output improvement relative to the switching interval is not observed. However, under the condition of shading, the output improvement sharply decreases relative to the switching interval; the output improvement at a 1-min switching interval is 0.15 kWh·h (+22.4%). For the 90-kW building-integrated photovoltaic system, during the summer solstice, a sharp difference in the output improvement relative to the switching interval is not observed. However, during the vernal equinox and winter solstice, when a large area of the PV system is shaded for a long period of time, the output improvement sharply decreases relative to the switching interval.

However, these systems may be adversely affected by shadows of surrounding buildings. In order to reduce the effect of shadows on solar panels, we propose the concept of a PV system with reconnection (smart PV), where PV arrays can be reconnected to minimize the mismatch loss depending on the output of each module measured at regular time intervals. In this study, the effects of minimizing the mismatch loss of a BIPV system by reconnection are evaluated by studying shadow patterns. The PV system with reconnection showed good performance for typical shadow patterns. In the evaluation, the optimized connection is determined by calculating the outputs of several array connection patterns. To analyze the daily impact of the PV system with reconnection, the daily output energy by the BIPV system that is partially shaded by a neighboring building is considered as a case study. The maximum improvement in the daily mismatch loss with the reconnection was 8.1 kWh per day compared with that of conventional array connections. In conclusion, it is shown that the PV system with reconnection shows better performance compared with conventional fixed array connections.",Building management system; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electrical engineering; Mismatch loss; Energy (signal processing); Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Shadow; Photovoltaic mounting system; Electronic engineering; Computer science; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.2011.6186434,conference article,University of Tsukuba,jp

Amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) requires processing at a temperature of 200–250 °C by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to obtain satisfactory optoelectronic properties, which limits such substrates in terms of thermal budget. This study is focused on the fabrication of p–i–n-type a-Si:H solar cells at relatively low temperatures (100 °C). Intrinsic a-Si:H films with large optical gaps (1.83 eV) were prepared at 100 °C using a high hydrogen dilution ratio. In addition, p-type amorphous silicon oxide and n-type microcrystalline silicon oxide films with large optical gaps and suitable conductivities were prepared at 100 °C using a gas mixture containing the dopant B2H6 or PH3 and CO2. Finally, an a-Si:H p–i–n cell was fabricated at 100 °C; it exhibited an excellent power conversion efficiency of 9.0%, which was higher than those reported for a-Si:H thin film photovoltaics prepared at 100 °C.

Using a typical magnetron sputtered InSnO (ITO) anode and a low energy sputtered InZnSnO (IZTO) cathode, we fabricated bidirectional transparent electrodes for semi-transparent PSCs. In particular, by the sequential sputtering of a thin buffer and then a thick dense IZTO layer (two-step sputtering), we fabricated a transparent IZTO cathode for a p-i-n planar type PSC without any plasma damage. Compared to the power conversion efficiency (PCE 3.43%) of PSCs with an ITO cathode prepared by typical DC magnetron sputtering, the PSC with a two-step sputtered IZTO cathode showed a much higher PCE (15.72%) due to the absence of plasma damage. The high PCE of the semi-transparent PSC with IZTO cathode is comparable to the PCE (17.04%) of an opaque PSC with opaque Ag cathode. Furthermore, with diluted perovskite solution, we able to achieve PCE of 13.61% and AVT of 24.70% both high enough to use as PSC for BIPV. These results demonstrate that the two-step linear facing target sputtering (FTS) process is a feasible approach to make high-quality transparent top cathodes for semi-transparent PSCs. Considering the mass-production of semi-transparent PSCs for BIPV, FTS-based two-step sputtering has great potential to become a key technique for producing smart windows that will replace typical solution coating or other complicated transfer processes.",Cavity magnetron; Perovskite (structure); Materials science; Energy conversion efficiency; Sputtering; Optoelectronics; Cathode; Photovoltaics; Sputter deposition; Anode,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105703,journal article,Sungkyunkwan University,kr

This analysis was performed through long-term monitoring of performance for 2 years. Electrical energy generation per unit power output was estimated through the 2 year monitoring of an actual BIPV system, which were 48.4 kWh/kWp/month and 580.5 kWh/kWp/year, respectively, while the measured energy generation data in this study were almost half of that reported from the existing data which were derived by general amorphous thin-film solar cell application. The reason is that the azimuth of the tested BIPV system in this study was inclined to 50° in the southwest and moreover, the self-shade caused by the projected building mass resulted in the further reduction of energy generation efficiency. From simulating influencing factors such as azimuth and shading, the measured energy generation efficiency in the tested condition can be improved up to 47% by changing the building location in terms of azimuth and shading, thus allowing better solar radiation for the PV module. Thus, from the real application of the BIPV system, the installation of a PV module associated with azimuth and shading can be said to be the essentially influencing factors on PV performance, and both factors can be useful design parameters in order to optimize a PV system for an architectural BIPV application.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optics; Azimuth; Automotive engineering; Amorphous silicon; Solar cell; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Amorphous solid; Electric potential energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2010.12.026,journal article,Hanbat National University,kr

Therefore, optimization through performance monitoring is necessary to maximize power generation of the system. This study used temperature-corrected normalized efficiency (NE*) to evaluate the power generation performance of the operation methods and predict that of the OBIPV system based upon the measured data. It was confirmed that power generation performance decreased when the photovoltaic (PV) operation angle changed, the system remaining the same. A decrease in power generation performance due to partial shading from an overhang was also observed. As a result of the power generation prediction for two months using NE*, the error of the measured values was found to be less than 3%. In addition, with or without any partial shading of the OBIPV system, its performance degradation was predicted with an annual electricity generation decrease by 36 kWh/yr (6.5%). Therefore, NE* can be used as an indicator for evaluating the power generation performance of PV systems, and to predict generation performance considering partial shading.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Shading; Building envelope; Building energy; Performance monitoring; Operation method; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12193777,journal article,Hanbat National University,kr
1211,002-177-225-278-465,Power performance analysis of a transparent DSSC BIPV window based on 2 year measurement data in a full-scale mock-up,2018,"Abstract Among transparent solar cells or modules, the DSSC (Dye-sensitized solar cell) has a relatively low production cost compared to silicon-based solar cells and provides a range of colors for building design. On the other hand, its commercialization has been limited by the low power generation efficiency and durability. Few studies have examined the power generation performance of a full scale DSSC module applied to actual buildings. In this study, a long-term performance test was conducted on vertical and inclined DSSC BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) windows applied to a full-scale mock-up facility to verify the power performance and power characteristics of transparent DSSC BIPV glazing under actual conditions over a 2 year period. The DSSC module was fabricated by the serial connection of nine 2.26Wp transparent DSSC sub-modules. The multi-layered DSSC BIPV glazing, which was composed of a “DSSC module (9mm)” + “air space (12 mm)” + “clear glass (5mm)” was joined to the curtain wall frame of the test cell facility. The unit size of the DSSC BIPV glazing was 0.975 m (W) × 0.965 m (H) and its maximum capacity was 20.34Wp. The size of the test cell facility was 3 m (W) × 3 m (H) × 9 m (D). The building is a container type insulated with 100 mm urethane foam. Four and two DSSC BIPV windows were installed on the vertical south wall and on the 30° sloped roof, respectively. Through the monitoring system, the power performance data of each DSSC BIPV windows and meteorological data were analyzed over a two year period (from 1st Jan. 2015 to 31st Dec. 2016). The 2 year data showed that the average daily power yield for each month of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 1.75 to 3.93 kWh/kWp·day (average 2.53 kWh/kWp·day), whereas that of the 30° sloped DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.16 to 5.34 kWh/kWp·day (average 3.60 kWh/kWp·day). The operating power efficiency of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.65 to 4.14% with an average of 3.40%, whereas that of the sloped DSSC BIPV window was in the range of 2.64–3.63% with a mean of 3.01%. The power generation efficiency of the vertical plane BIPV window was higher than the sloped BIPV window. In contrast to the average daily power yield, the power efficiency of the vertical window was higher than that of the sloped window, which may be due to the higher efficiency of the DSSCs under overcast conditions. This is consistent with the power performance of the DSSC BIPV windows according to the sky conditions, which showed an increase in power efficiency with increasing cloud cover or decreasing solar intensity.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electrical efficiency; Materials science; Roof; Solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Optoelectronics; Glazing,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.086,journal article,Hanbat National University,kr

To minimize the temperature increase of the PV modules, this study proposes a passive cooling technology that can improve the natural cooling performance by creating dual airflow paths for the building applied photovoltaic (BAPV) system. To experimentally verify this natural cooling technology (NCT), a BAPV system with the NCT and a conventional BAPV system of the same capacity were constructed, and their power-generation performances based on the three-month experimental results in a cold weather season were compared under the same environmental conditions. The BAPV system with the NCT on average generated 4.5% more power than the conventional BAPV system. The performance ratio (PR) analysis showed that the average PR value of the BAPV system with the NCT was 87.1%, which was approximately 5.5% higher than that of the conventional BAPV system. Results suggest that the proposed NCT improved the airflow on the backside of the PV modules and supplied fresh air to all of them, and hence, it improved the cooling performance and induced relatively lower module temperatures.

However, after producing electrical energy, the remaining solar energy is transferred as heat, raising the temperature at the rear of the BIPV module, and reducing electrical efficiency. On the other hand, a PVT (Photovoltaic Thermal) collector is a device that generates electricity from a PV module and at the same time uses the heat transferred to the air layer inside the collector. In general, the performance of air-type PVT collectors is based on energy analysis using the first law of thermodynamics. Since this performance does not take into account the loss amount, it is not the actual amount of power generation and preheat of the collector that can be used. Therefore, an exergy analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics considering the amount of energy loss must be performed. In this paper, an air-type PVT collector to which perforated baffles were applied was tested through outdoor experiments based on ISO 9806 standard. The total energy (thermal and electrical characteristics) and exergy according to the flow rate (100, 150, and 200 m3/h), solar radiation, and rear temperature of the PV module of the air-type PVT collector were analyzed. As a result, the total exergy efficiency of the air-type PVT collector with perforated baffles was 24.8–30.5% when the total energy efficiency was 44.1–63.3%.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Exergy; Nuclear engineering; Electrical efficiency; Baffle; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Solar energy; Exergy efficiency,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14102919,journal article,Kongju National University,kr

The advantages of, and requirements for, ZEBs are described, concerning the sectors energy, water, nutrients and biomass. ZEBs are characterized by net zero energy consumption through minimization of the service energy demand, which is covered with locally produced renewable energy. The direct water footprint is reduced up to 100% through on-site water supply and wastewater management according to the principles of Integrated Water Resource Management and Sustainable Sanitation. The fresh water demand is reduced through application of water efficient systems, as well as the collection, processing, recycling and reuse of wastewater for non-drinking purposes. Rainwater harvesting, storage, utilization and infiltration for augmentation of groundwater facilitates onsite freshwater supply and drinking water production from rainwater and groundwater. Nutrients and biomass from kitchens and sanitation systems are processed on-site and are recycled for local horticulture and agriculture. Traditional Korean buildings can be generally defined as ZEBs. With modernization and implementation of state of the art centralized infrastructure systems in the 20th century also traditional know-how and practice regarding the sustainable operation of buildings and resource management has been forgotten.

Therefore, the application of a Renewable Energy System (RES) to produce electricity is necessary for a ZEB.

Therefore, this study aims to conduct a technical performance analysis of SPB based on the solar tracking method considering the climate factors. Towards this end, this study conducted an experiment in South Korea using the prototype model of smart SPB.

1224,038-260-072-916-123,High-efficiency white-light solar window using waveguide glass plate,2019,"Abstract A high-efficiency white-light solar window is proposed for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. In the solar window, incident light is scattered at a waveguide plate and guided into GaAs cell arrays at the edges of the window frame. The optical characteristics of the waveguide plate are designed and evaluated using a ray-tracing simulation, and the solar window is fabricated and assembled with three-dimensional printing. The solar window exhibits an almost constant transmittance, with an average of about 21.6% in the visible range of 400–800 nm and a color rendering index of about 97.8 for sunlight, which is a neutral color that does not distort the colors of indoor objects under sunlight through the window. The solar window achieves a geometric concentration gain of 1.14 and edge collection ratio (ECR) of about 27.0%, which is constantly obtainable regardless of the incident angle of sunlight, and it exhibits an efficiency of 6.368%, a very high value for conventional transparent solar cells and modules. The method for optimizing the window efficiency and effective indoor illuminance by increasing the size of the solar window is also presented. These results can contribute to the further development of high-performance and large-area BIPV windows.",Color rendering index; Optics; Transmittance; Sunlight; Ray; Materials science; Window (computing); Waveguide (optics); Illuminance; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109341,journal article,Korea Aerospace University,kr

This study evaluates the potential energy benefits of integrating semi-transparent solar cell windows and daylight-dimming systems for a 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) code-compliant residential building in a hot and humid climate. This study used whole-building energy simulation models, a DOE-2.1e BIPV window module created for this study, and an existing daylight-dimming system module. Based on the simulation results, peak demand, energy use, and electricity production from each orientation (east-, west-, south-, and north-facing) were all analyzed. The south-facing window showed the greatest potential to generate electric power and reduce cooling loads/use, whereas the east-facing window resulted in the largest annual lighting energy savings. As compared to the code-compliant base-case model, the BIPV windows showed great potential for energy savings: about 12–21% in annual energy use, and 14–26% in peak cooling demand. In addition, the parametric study varying the window-to-wall ratio (WWR) with the BIPV window resulted that the larger BIPV window provided more savings in annual total energy use.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Peak demand; Daylight; Automotive engineering; Electricity; International Energy Conservation Code; Environmental science; Electric power; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.06.039,journal article,Hanbat National University,kr

Three types of BIPV modules (glass to glass, glass to Tedlar/crystal, and amorphous) were installed in the building envelopes (roofs, walls, windows, atrium, and pergola) with a total capacity of 116.2 kWp. Over a five-year period, the average annual energy production was 855.6 kWh/kWp, the system loss ranged from 0.14 to 0.31 h/d, and the capture loss ranged from 0.21 to 1.81 h/d. The causes of capture losses were degradation of the power generation efficiency of the horizontal installation module due to the accumulation of dust and reduced energy production due to application of the same inverter for the crystal system module and amorphous module. As a result, the BIPV systems with an installation angle of 30° exhibited approximately 57% higher energy production than vertically (90°) installed systems under the same solar radiation. Moreover, horizontal (0°) BIPV systems exhibited up to 14% higher energy production than vertical BIPV systems.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Inverter; Pergola; Nuclear engineering; Zero-energy building; Renewable energy; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Amorphous solid,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12132471,journal article,Yonsei University,kr

In particular, coloring methods for perovskite solar cells have been actively studied to meet the aesthetic needs for BIPV. To date, studies based on TiO2–SiO2-based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) have been reported owing to their good color selectivity and low power conversion efficiency (PCE) loss. However, the application of TiO2 layers as DBRs for building exterior can result in serious problem due to their high photocatalytic activity. Therefore, in this study, to overcome this problem, the TiO2 layers in both DBR and electron selective layer in perovskite solar cells are replaced by SnO2 films. SnO2–SiO2 DBRs with various SiO2 thicknesses were synthesized by a simple spin-coating process.

In other words, a PVT system can improve the electricity efficiency of BIPVs while using the waste heat of BIPVs as a source of thermal energy for the building. By generating thermal and electrical energies simultaneously, PVT systems can improve the utilization of solar energy while enhancing the energy performance of buildings. To optimize the performance of an air-type PVT collector, it is necessary for the system to extract more heat from the PV module. Consequently, this approach decreases PV temperature to improve PV electrical energy generation. The thermal and electrical performance of an air-type PVT collector depends on its design, which affects airflow and heat transfer. Moreover, the performances of the PVT collector can differ according to the coupled facility in the building. In this study, the thermal and electrical performances of an advanced air-type PVT collector with a direct expansion air handling unit (AHU) were analyzed experimentally. For this purpose, six prototypes of an advanced air-type PVT collector were developed. Furthermore, a direct expansion AHU with a heat recovery exchanger (HRX) was designed and built. The advanced PVT collectors with a total capacity of 740 Wp were installed in an experimental house and were coupled to the direct expansion AHU system with a maximum airflow of 700 CMH. The performance of PVT collectors was analyzed and compared with the BIPV system. Results showed that building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) collectors produced 30 W more power than the BIPV system. When operating the AHU system, the temperature of the BIPVT collector was generally lower than the BIPV. The maximum difference in temperature between BIPVT and BIPV was about 22 °C.

In addition, using LED lighting resulted in greater dimming efficiency compared to conventional fluorescent lighting. The PV blind slat angle should also be controlled according to the profile angle of the sun to maximize power generation. However, it can reduce electrical lighting energy saving indoors. To evaluate the impact of the PV blind slat angle control on such reductions in energy savings, this study conducted experiments throughout the season to identify the amount of electricity generation of the PV blind systems and the amount of electrical lighting energy savings by implementing the slat angle of blinds control.

Simulated data was also evaluated to determine the influence of the inclined angles and the azimuth on the power performance of the PV module. The experimental and computed data fitted comparatively well through the relative error estimation after calibration. It was found that the PV module with a slope of 30°, facing south, provided the best power performance according to an annual power output, producing about 2.5 times higher power output than that with the vertical module. Furthermore, the PV module facing south showed higher power output than that to the east. The varying power output of the PV module with inclined angles can be explained by the impact of the incidence angle modifier of the glass on the PV module.

The surface structure modification by etching the front glass in BIPV modules and the use of a thin niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) film as a back coating enable the silicon solar cells to be hidden from view without a serious loss in the power efficiency. By employing the etched front glass and Nb2O5 back coating, silicon solar cells embedded in the BIPV module exhibited power conversion efficiency of 15.23% and fill factor of 65.05%. We also investigate the origin of the improved photovoltaic performance of the solar cells in the BIPV modules. The surface modification of the front cover glass of the BIPV windows enhances the light absorption in the solar cells, which results in the improved photovoltaic performance degraded by a metal-oxide back coating.

1239,069-617-824-971-154,Pt Nanoparticles Immobilized on CVD‐Grown Graphene as a Transparent Counter Electrode Material for Dye‐Sensitized Solar Cells,2013,"The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has attracted considerable attention as a next-generation solar cell because of its many virtues such as low fabrication cost, environmentally benign process, glossy transparency, and relatively high energy conversion efficiency. One of the issues with DSCs is the need to improve the transfer of electrons into the redox system to activate electrolyte reduction at the counter electrode (CE). Pt is traditionally the most popular material for the CE of DSCs, and numerous substitutes, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), CNT–TiN, and CNT–Pt materials, have been developed to replace or reduce the amount of expensive Pt used. Owing to its unique 2D structure, large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and robust mechanical strength, graphene is known as one of the best supports for metal nanoparticles (NPs) for applications in energy conversion/storage devices. Graphene–metal composites have mostly been synthesized through either chemical or physical methods. However, extreme conditions such as high temperature, low pressure, a liquid environment, and chemical toxicity become drawbacks for the application of graphene–metal composites in large-scale production. Recently, we developed a new process for efficiently synthesizing supported PtNPs by using dry plasma reduction (DPR) near room temperature under atmospheric pressure. The aim of this technique was to overcome the previously mentioned process restrictions. Herein, we demonstrate the use of DPR to synthesize PtNPs on chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene under atmospheric pressure, without using any toxic chemicals, near room temperature. The aim of this study was to develop transparent and efficient DSCs, which are crucial for realizing building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), through synergistically combining the high transparency of CVD-grown graphene and the low charge-transfer resistance of supported PtNPs by using methods that keep the production cost low. The synthesis of Pt NPs hybridized on CVD-grown graphene was achieved by using DPR, as shown in Scheme 1. First, a drop of precursor solution was loaded on the substrate, followed by complete drying of the solvent at 70 8C for 10 min.

The study first investigated the monthly PR of each inverter to verify what caused the decrease in power performance by analyzing PR variation. Then, the shading analysis was performed using a simulation to analyze the capture loss of measured power performance and ultimately to find out the effect by partial shading components such as small overhang louvers of each floor, obstructions of adjacent building, and nearby hillock. The one-year measurement of the power performance showed that the annual average reference yield was 2.15 h/day and the final yield was 1.52 h/day; moreover, it was analyzed that the annual average capture loss was 0.49 h/day and the system loss was 0.14 h/day. Monthly average reference yield in summer (between April and August) showed only 1.28 h/day which was 54% lower than the other seasons with average 2.77 h/day. The annual average of PR was 0.69 (the monthly maximum of 0.77 and minimum of 0.58); the average PR in the summer with low reference yield was 0.64, while the average PR for other seasons was 0.73. Whereas monthly variation of LS (system loss) did not show big difference of under 9%, monthly LC (capture loss) highly varied with fluctuation. These primarily arise from the effect of the partial shading and vertically installed angle of south-facing BIPV modules. The BIPV system consisted of four arrays and installed on the same south facade. However, the power performance analysis per array showed that each array had different performances. The arrays located above the facade had the highest PR, from 0.74, 0.75, 0.66, and 0.62 respectively in order. In addition, LS and LC analysis of each array showed that there was performance difference mainly by LC, due to the influence of an adjacent building located in the south. The analysis using the simulation showed the adjacent building did not cast any shading but affected on decrease in diffuse solar radiation whose amount was depending on the array location. When it comes to the lowest array, nearly 7% of annual insolation was blocked by front building. The shading analysis, furthermore, revealed that the overhang louvers caused a partial shading problem in spite of short extrusion of 40 mm depth all through the year, and particularly, showed a big effect during summer because of high solar altitude. The extruded louvers caused decrease in 4.5% of average insolation loss over the year.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electrical efficiency; Shading; Louver; Facade; Power performance; Window system; Solar altitude; Environmental science; Atmospheric sciences,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2016.07.056,journal article,Hanbat National University,kr

To apply PV modules in buildings, various factors should be considered, such as the installation angle and orientation of PV module, shading, and temperature. The temperature of PV modules that are attached to building surfaces especially is one of the most important factors, as it affects both the electrical efficiency of a PV module and the energy load in a building. This study investigates the electrical and thermal performance of a semi-transparent PV module that was designed as a glazing component. The study evaluates the effects of the PV module's thermal characteristics on its electrical generation performance.

1267,078-783-623-824-115,Building Energy Renovation and Smart Integration of Renewables in a Social Housing Block Toward Nearly-Zero Energy Status,2020,"Like other islands, Malta experiences great challenges to secure its energy supply and independence. Deep renovation of buildings to nearly zero energy (NZEB) and addressing “smart-readiness” are widely believed to contribute to solving such challenges, while meeting the exigencies of the 2018 European Union energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD). NZEB benchmarks for residential buildings in Malta have been defined using established EPBD cost-optimal methodologies, however these guidelines detailing a one-step and one benchmark definition approach neglects peak loads, building-grid interaction requirements and energy storage. To counteract these inadequacies, this research proposes an innovative multi-criteria approach adapted from ISO 52000-1:2017 standard, which supports the new EPBD requirements for optimising comfort and addressing energy poverty. This is carried out by first optimising adaptive comfort in “free-running mode”, before switching to mechanical space heating and cooling. When implementing this approach on a case study of an existing 40-family social housing block undergoing deep renovation, it was found that the discomfort hours have been reduced drastically, while the peak demand for the remaining discomfort hours requiring mechanical heating and cooling has been halved. Despite such positive impact of passive measures, the research has quantitatively demonstrated that given Malta’s temperate climate, such measures have lower impact on the energy rating of the building, when compared to that achieved with active and renewable energy (RE) measures. Thus, the proposed multi-tier benchmarking approach ensures that each energy efficiency measure is appropriately weighted on its own merits, rather than lumping all measures under a single benchmark indicator. With regards to smartness indicators for load matching and grid interaction, a detailed analysis using SAM software demonstrated that battery energy storage systems have the capacity to match the renewable energy supply to the demand, although this approach is still far away from being cost-optimal. The research concluded that RE incentives should therefore move away from feed-in tariffs and subsidise direct energy use, storage, and load matching given their high costs. Furthermore, the cost-optimal analysis should also quantify the costs of thermal discomfort, energy poverty and grid mismatch, to ensure a holistic approach to deep renovation of buildings.",Environmental economics; Peak demand; Renewable energy; Efficient energy use; Energy supply; Energy poverty; European union; Computer science; Energy storage; Building automation,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2020.560892,journal article,University of Malta,mt

To this end, a model based on the physics of heat transfer and optics is proposed, allowing the calculation of the temperature of BIPV modules and their thermal transmittance (U-value) in real operating conditions. The main contribution of this model is to include the impact of some parameters not considered so far, like the solar irradiance and the electrical efficiency. After being validated with experimental data, the model has been used to simulate single and double PV glazing, that compared later with common glazing with the same composition and configuration demonstrate the non-equivalent performance between them, showing differences of about 35% in the U-value under high irradiance conditions. This way, a clear disagreement with the current standard testing procedures occurs, something that should be reviewed.

Building integration of STPV (semi-transparent photovoltaic) elements affects deeply the building energy demand since it influences the heating, cooling and lighting loads as well as the local electricity generation. This work analyses over different window-to-wall ratios the overall energy performance of five STPV elements, each element having a specific degree of transparency, in order to assess the energy saving potential compared to a conventional solar control glass compliant with the local technical standard. The prior optical characterization, focused to measure the spectral properties of the elements, was experimentally undertaken. The obtained data were used to perform simulations based on a reference office building using a package of specific software tools (DesignBuilder, EnergyPlus, PVsyst, and COMFEN) to take proper account of the STPV peculiarities. To evaluate the global energy performance of the STPV elements a new Energy Balance Index was formulated.

However, at the moment there are several initiatives which give some hints that lead to think that there will be a change shortly. In countries where this technology is already a daily reality, such as Germany, Japan or Spain, the recommendations and basic criteria to avoid losses due to orientation and tilt are widespread. Extrapolating those measures used in high latitudes to all regions, without a previous deeper analysis, is standard practice. They do not always correspond to reality, what frequently leads to false assumptions and may become an obstacle in a country which is taking the first step in this area. In this paper, the solar potential yield for different surfaces in Brazilian cities (located at latitudes between 0° and 30°S) are analyzed with the aim of providing the necessary tools to evaluate the suitability of the buildings’ envelopes for photovoltaic use.",Latitude; Environmental economics; Building envelope; Obstacle; Lead (geology); Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Remote sensing; Yield (finance); High availability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.08.044,journal article,Technical University of Madrid,mx

Photovoltaic (PV) modules can be designed as relevant components of building envelopes, energy-producing units, fulfilling the multiple requirements of construction elements. Their integration in architectural glazings is still impeded by the inherent optical features of commercial solar cells, but also aesthetic, economic and social constraints, still acting as relevant barriers. In this roadmap, novel PV technologies could be effective drivers of a real change of paradigm. We have recently demonstrated that a coherent and exhaustive study of BIPV for semitransparent cells requires a “holistic approach”, taking into account the complex fallouts of semitransparent modules on the energy balance, but also the full assessment of visual comfort benefits deriving from their integration in glazings. We have demonstrated that BIPV could offer manifold advantages: visual comfort effects comparable to commercially available solar control glasses and fair energy yield. Moreover, we found that in several cases the annual energy production overcomes the amount of electric energy used for artificial lighting.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Energy (signal processing); Renewable energy; Energy balance; Artificial light; Electric power; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.08.256,journal article,Instituto Politécnico Nacional,mx
1279,183-080-917-262-950,"Modeling, performance analysis and economic feasibility of a mirror-augmented photovoltaic system",2014,"In the last years, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have had great impetus with research and demonstration projects, both in Italy and other European countries. The main problems with solar PV are the cost of solar electricity, which is still higher compared with other renewables (such as wind or biomass), due to the cost of semi-conductors, and the low conversion efficiency. However, PV panel prices are rapidly decreasing benefiting from favorable economies of scale. For instance, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) the US average levelized costs for plants entering service in the 2018 should be 144.3$/MW h for solar PV, whereas 111.0$/MW h for biomass and 86.6$/MW h for wind (Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook, 2013). In order to increase the electric yield of PV modules (which can be even doubled with respect to constant tilt configurations), without significantly increasing the system costs, it was decided to consider the addition of inclined mirrors at both sides of the PV modules, so as to deflect more solar rays towards them, as in Mirror-Augmented Photovoltaic (MAPV) systems. The system preserves its constructive simplicity with commercial flat PV modules even though dual axis tracker must be implemented, since MAPV systems harness mainly the direct radiation. The performance analysis of MAPV systems starts from the calculation of the global irradiation on the surface of the PV module which is a sum of the direct sunlight on it and the irradiation reflected by the mirrors. A mathematical model of a MAPV system is presented, which takes into account not only the increase of direct (or beam) radiation, due to the mirrors, but also the reduction of both the diffuse and reflected radiations due to the shadowing effect of the flat mirrors. In particular, under an isotropic sky assumption, a simplified analytical expression, applicable in the case of MAPV systems, for the sky-view factor has been developed. The deterioration in the performance of the PV system as a result of the increasing cell temperature with radiation augmentation due to mirrors has been also evaluated. Moreover, in order to provide a more realistic view of the process, the energy analysis is accompanied by the exergy analysis. Finally, in order to analyse the economics of MAPV systems, Net Present Value, Discounted Payback Period, Internal Rate of Return and Life-Cycle Costs, have been considered and compared with both a constant tilt building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system and a system with a dual axis tracker.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Exergy; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Automotive engineering; Renewable energy; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Discounted payback period; Photovoltaic system; Cost of electricity by source,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.12.074,journal article,Instituto Politécnico Nacional,mx

The growth of BIPV systems on LV distribution networks has the potential to alter the direction of power flow across the distribution networks, hence imposing several serious technical issues relating to power quality, distribution system efficiency and possible equipment overloading. Therefore, the utility companies need to study the following technical issues: (i) voltage regulation, (ii) voltage rise, (iii) voltage unbalance, (iv) network power losses, and (v) cable and transformer thermal limits. This paper describes research carried out to investigate and quantify the impacts of BIPV on LV networks with particular reference to developing countries striving to increase the utilisation of renewable energy. This paper presents and discusses the impacts of BIPV systems on two types of LV distribution network: a commercial LV distribution network and a residential LV distribution network in the state of Selangor, Malaysia.

Nonetheless, there is another type of building integration technology – building integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPV/T), which is gaining popularity. In this paper the discussions start with introducing the BIPV and compared to the BIPV/T technologies. BIPV refers to designs with or without ventilated fluid (air or water), which is able to cool the PV panels and increase the electrical output, and the fluid is then exhausted to the ambient. Whereas for the BIPV/T, ventilated fluid is used as working fluid to collect heat from the PV panel for heating or drying purposes. Installations of BIPV and BIPV/T systems on the roof and wall, as well as using different heat transfer working fluids are also discussed. Case studies of such building integration technologies are also reviewed, including the economics aspect.

All data were collected over the year 2009 at GreenTech 92 kWp installed PV system in Selangor, Malaysia. The models were compared using r, MBE, RMSE, and MPE. The results showed that the proposed models give the highest value of correlation coefficient r, and good result when considering statistical indicators i.e. low RMSE, low MBE, and low MPE values. The results show that the proposed regression models have advantages over the conventional approaches for calculating the hourly and day-average PV module temperature, and give the closest results comparing to the actual measurements. The proposed approaches can be used as effective tools for predicting the PV module temperature, whether a simple PV module, open rack system, BIPV installations, or even PV/Thermal collector, in remote and rural locations with no direct measurement equipment.

1302,039-832-967-260-652,Renewable Energy Performance of the Green Buildings: Key-Enabler on Useful Consumption Yield,2020,"Malaysia’s Eleventh Plan started to encourage green building developments and green industries to stimulate green growth. Eventually, the Malaysian government had launched a new commitment to accelerate the green and efficient energy sector and revised the quota of Renewable Energy (RE) towards higher capacity for electricity generation. These scenarios had highlighted the latest commitment of the Malaysian government to implement both green building development and concurrently, streamline the additional quota for RE generation. Due to this, the evolution of the requirement of RE-based Distributed Generation (DG) in the green building development for higher installed-capacity was expected to occur in ensuring the government key achievement becomes more visible. This study focuses on measuring the expanded-capacity performance of the Solar Photovoltaic (PV)-type DG unit (PV-DG) through the Green Building Rating System (GBRS), particularly on the useful energy consumption yield for load and total line loss minimization. Previous work has conducted a MATLAB simulation on a PV-DG capacity expansion guided by the Net Energy Metering (NEM) specification considering the total line loss minimization as the main objective function. These results are being adopted to obtain the ratio of useful energy consumption from the generated PV-DG through the selected distribution network.

1305,045-276-535-678-302,Solar thermal systems for large high rise buildings in Malaysia,2014,"Malaysia and Southeast Asia in general, is a very suitable region for implementing solar technologies because Malaysia is located near the equatorial line, where sunlight remains strong and stable throughout the year. The average solar radiation per month is 400–600MJ/m, so Malaysia should fully utilise solar energy because it is clean and sustainable. Solar energy can be considered as renewable energy that is environmentally friendly and can be continually replenished from time to time. The use of renewable energy is expected to increase exponentially in the future because natural resources could become depleted due to the increasing usage due to growing population in a world hungry for energy consumption for domestic, industrial and leisure purposes. Solar energy can provide infinite amount of energy because the sun can last for another few billions of years from now. So, many advanced nations have developed solar technologies to be implemented in a variety of sectors that include power generation and domestic water heating. The geographical location of Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries has enabled this region to be different from Western European countries that could only utilise solar energy through technology. Malaysia is located near the equatorial line, and so the sunlight in Malaysia remains strong and stable throughout the year. The average solar radiation per month for Malaysia is 400–600MJ/m, and hence the country has a very high prospect to develop large-scale solar power plants. For now, Malaysian government is putting a lot of effort to promote solar energy use in Malaysia. The initial implementation of solar energy in Malaysia is for domestic solar water heaters. Unfortunately, the use of solar water heaters domestically and commercially is still low. According to estimate, around 45,000 buildings in Malaysia are appropriate for solar thermal usage, but 10% of them are not suitable because of roof shadings and structure. Different economic sectors in Malaysia can provide 110,000,000m of building surfaces for solar thermal applications and so about 75GW of power can be produced from this application. The photovoltaic (PV) technology was first built in Malaysia during 1980s in order to provide electricity to rural areas. Tenaga Nasional Bierhad, the national utility company, began to set up grid-connected PV systems as an alternative for national power utility and power production in 1998. One PV system was built at a British Petroleum petrol station along KESAS highway with 8 kWp capacity and another one built at the Solar Energy Research Institute at National University of Malaysia with 5.5 kWp capacity. In 2000, the first Malaysian Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system was built in Port Dickson with 3.15 kWp capacity. Malaysia’s universities are focusing on five majors of R&D for solar technologies, including inverters, PV concentrators, cells fabrications, hybrid systems and energy conversion tracking systems. The funding for the research in PV technologies is provided by Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI). Malaysian government also provides tax incentives so that a portion of the total cost of installing PV system can be deducted. The Feed-InTariffs can be the most promising policy because the utility pays a prestige price for the grid-connected PV electricity generated by system proprietors, and there is a 20-year of guarantee for the price. In short, Malaysia has a huge prospect to implement large-scale solar thermal systems. A solar collector is a type of heat exchanger that converts solar radiant energy into heat energy. Flat plate collector (FPC) is a type of solar thermal collectors. It will require minimal maintenance and is mechanically simple and with low installation cost. Major applications of solar energy like solar water heating, industrial process heating and air conditioning are using FPCs. Thermal performance for FPCs is treated in concise details, and the equations for collector performance can be reduced to simpler forms for performance analysis. Evacuated tube collectors (ETCs) contain heat pipe inside a vacuum-sealed tube.

1306,048-192-729-098-219,Quantifying the added value of BiPV as a shading solution in atria,2009,"Abstract Building integration of photovoltaics (PV) has long been acknowledged as a key application for PV in developed countries. The avoided use of comparably priced alternatives such as polished or cut stone in commercial facades enables PV to be applied often at little or no additional cost. The use of semi-transparent PV modules within commercial atria represents an interesting application in this respect as they can be used to replace traditional shading solutions which often have a high maintenance burden. However, compared to standard double glazing, an element incorporating either mono or poly crystalline PV cells in a glass–glass construction comes at a cost premium. To justify such an application there must be significant added value in the PV solution. This paper critically appraises a semi-transparent PV atrium which links two administration buildings at the University of Southampton, enclosing the main campus reception desk. Choosing PV laminates for the atrium roof has multiple benefits for the building users and the wider University, such as electricity generation, solar shading, environmental and technology statements, enhanced comfort and prestigious office workspace. This paper compares alternative shading solutions for the atrium and discusses user perception of the building and the atrium’s impact on their personal workspace. It is shown that PV in commercial atria does not always have to be considered as a ‘luxury’ option. With appropriate consideration of added value factors its selection can be justified in terms of both cost and carbon footprint.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architectural engineering; Desk; Roof; Carbon footprint; Computer science; Electricity generation; Glazing; Photovoltaics; Added value,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2008.07.016,journal article,University of Southampton,my
1307,052-197-562-388-878,Performance Analysis of a Hybrid Thin Film Photovoltaic (PV) Vacuum Glazing,2020,"In this study, we have investigated a hybrid thin film PV vacuum glazing called: ‘PV VG-4L’. The glazing involves an integration between a thin film PV glazing with a double vacuum glazing (both manufactured independently), and an additional layer of self-cleaning coated glass which totalling four layers of glass. The mathematical model of the PV VG-4L designs were developed and numerically solved in MATLAB. To evaluate the performance of the PV VG-4L, the prototype was manufactured and investigated at lab-scale and also under real conditions. Lab-scale experiments were conducted at steady state conditions using a TEC driven calibrated hot box at the Sustainable Energy Research Lab, University of Nottingham, UK. Meanwhile, outdoors, the prototype was tested at a research house at the University of Nottingham, UK. Under the influence of solar irradiance, the electrical performance of the PV-VG and the temperature difference between the surfaces of the glazing were analysed. However, the measurement of U-value under real conditions is not reliable due to the influence of solar irradiance on the heat flux sensor and also due to the absorbed solar irradiance by the thin film PV layer. Nevertheless, during low to zero solar irradiance, the U-value of the prototype can be estimated. The developed model was then validated against the experimental results by direct comparison to the trend of the experimental and theoretical curves obtained, and also by conducting error analysis using root mean squared percentage deviation (RMSPD) method. Testing using the calibrated hot box, adhering closely to ISO 12567 standards, resulted in an average measured total U-value of 0.6 W/m2K which is when compared to a single thin film PV glazing with a typical U-value of 5 W/m2K; the U-value is higher by almost 90%. From the analysis, the computed RMSPD value for the glazing surface temperature and the U-value are 4.02% and 0.92% respectively. Meanwhile, field testing under real conditions with a 0.4 m × 0.4 m PV VG-4L prototype found that 14 W/m2 power can be generated by the PV VG-4L at average solar irradiance of ~600 W/m2. RMSPD computed glazing surface temperatures, electrical power generated under real conditions and U-value are 2.90%, 8.70% and 2.89% respectively. The theoretical and experimental results are concluded to be in good agreement. This study has significant contributions to the knowledge of building integrated photovoltaic PV technology. The mathematical model that has been developed can be used for PV VG-4L design optimisation and also to simulate the performance of PV VG-4L under various conditions. At building efficiency level, the PV VG-4L not only can produce power, but it also has high insulating properties. The promising U-value implies its range of potential applications which can be improved depending on the energy needs and applications, such as for BIPV solar facade (PV curtain walling) in commercial buildings, greenhouses, skylight and conservatory.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Nuclear engineering; Thin film; Materials science; Hot box; Facade; Heat flux sensor; Photovoltaic system; Glazing; Solar irradiance,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/fce.73,journal article,National University of Malaysia,my

Therefore, this study aims to review the current applications and trends of dynamic shading systems to clarify the potentials and limitations in enhancing system performance based on integrated design objectives. This study assessed several systems on the basis of a critical review to identify different models, applications and methodologies. This study is divided into two main sections: (i) design elements and platforms that engage with specific methods in creating a dynamic shading system and (ii) evaluation strategies to examine system performance. The systems were investigated based on the multiplicity and integration of the parameters involved through various components, such as architectural, mechanical, operational and automation components.

This concentrator is designed to tackle two issues: (i) providing sufficient gain in order to increase the electrical output of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system and (ii) reducing the size of the PV cell needed, hence minimising the cost of the system. These experiments carried out had the objective of investigating the characteristics of the cell with the concentrator, the angular performance of the structure, and the effect of temperature on the cell. In each case, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and the power–voltage (P–V) characteristics are plotted and analysed. An outdoor experiment was also conducted to verify the results obtained from the indoor experiments.

It has been shown that for buildings with roof top PV systems only the avoidance of lightning attachment to unprotected parts of the building is not sufficient. Lightning currents passing through the lightning protection system may still affect the PV power system through inductive coupling. Hence strategic placement of PV systems and shielding of conducting systems wherever possible has been recommended.

1322,104-897-097-441-734,Implementation of photovoltaics in Malaysia,2009,This paper aims to explore the viability of photovoltaic (PV) systems in Malaysia. The Malaysian Energy Center (PTM)'s Suria1000 project highlights the problems associated with rooftop PV systems. TNB's off-grid PV projects also provide valuable lessons on standalone PV systems. PTM's Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) project shows grid-connected rooftop PV systems are viable. The annual energy output of these installations has been found to be in the top 50 % of similar installations Worldwide. The major obstacles to these systems are the high capital cost of the system and the absence of a feed-in tariff. TNB's experience with off-grid PV projects point to their viability as an attractive alternative to costly extension of the grid for small isolated loads. The major problem is the high maintenance cost of these installations. Simulation studies indicate that standalone PV systems with storage capacity and backup generator are cheaper than grid extension for small loads beyond a certain distance from the grid. Rooftop PV generation in the commercial areas of the city can also be an attractive alternative to upgrading the existing grid capacity. The study concludes that various PV system options need to be introduced into the country on an urgent basis to bring down capital and maintenance costs as well as provide learning opportunities to upgrade the technical competencies of its human resource.,Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Capital cost; Grid; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Operations management; Tariff; Backup; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iceenviron.2009.5398614,conference article,Universiti Tenaga Nasional,my

BIPV and BAPV turn the present and future buildings (high rise or low rise) into power stations with the introduction of photovoltaics either in the facade (90° wall) or roof (flat or pitched) configuration. But one of the significant challenges that influence the energy performance is the dust accumulation. This is a serious issue in the places where air pollution is very high. Addressing this would be very difficult for the human workforce, and the complexity and tediousness would increase depending on the size of the BIPV and BAPV array or the height of the building. Currently, there are few dust cleaning robots which could offer services in addressing the soiling issues in conventional photovoltaic installations. The existing dust cleaning robots (DCR) could not offer a better feasible solution in BIPV and BAPV as they offered in traditional PV systems that were installed in an open area. Hence for addressing dust cleaning issue, some novel conceptual schemas related to robot developments were proposed in this paper considering the installation configuration of PV systems for building applications. Here, DCR’s for three configuration of PV installation with building applications namely BIPV/BAPV facade, BIPV/BAPV horizontal roof, and BIPV/BAPV pitched roof are dealt.

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is incorporated in the TiO2 matrix to improve its electron transport properties. Nevertheless, rGO cannot give full benefit of graphene due to its defective structure, which promotes recombination. Therefore, here a solvent exfoliated high-quality graphene in mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode having mixed phase composition anatase, rutile, and brookite phase is introduced. Graphene/TiO2 hybrid structures are produced with different graphene loading, and their structural, optical, and electron transport properties are thoroughly investigated. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicates that electron lifetime increases by 159%, electron diffusion length increases by 25%, while recombination rate reduces by 62.77% than the pure TiO2 at optimum graphene loading (0.0025 wt%). Consequently, an increase of 18.45% and 30.89% PCE is obtained relative to pure TiO2 and commercial paste, respectively.",Materials science; Anatase; Brookite; Oxide; Graphene; Chemical engineering; Phase (matter); Dye-sensitized solar cell; Dielectric spectroscopy; Mesoporous material,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2020.06.003,journal article,Universiti Teknologi Petronas,my

The heat transfer and energy balance of PVT air collectors were analysed and reviewed based on the model, quantity of cover, channels and forms of the collector. A mathematical model was developed to describe actual working situations and to examine new shut PVT collectors. The first law of thermodynamics is the principal equation in the model.

A main question in this field is how we can ensure the intended performance of such systems considering different involved parameters over the system's life-time. To do so, we need to be able to predict normal behavior of BIPV systems in urban environments, considering the effect of shading from neighboring obstructions. This research investigates a combination of real-time shading simulation using Rhino and Grasshopper with BIPV performance monitoring to detect abnormal system operation.

Having the form of semitransparent plates, LSCs offer a high degree of flexibility and can be used as windows or facades, as part of the of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) industry. Existing performance characterizations of LSC devices focus almost exclusively on electric power generation. However, when used as window components, the transmitted spectrum can alter the color, potentially affecting the visual comfort of the occupants by altering the properties of the sunlight. In this study, eight different state-of-the-art nanocrystals are evaluated as potential candidates for LSC window luminophores, using Monte Carlo simulations. The transparency of each LSC window varies between 90% and 50%, and the color-rendering properties are assessed with respect to the color rendering index (CRI) and the correlated color temperature (CCT). It is found that luminophores with a wide absorption bandwidth in the visible spectrum can maintain a high CRI value (above 85) and CCT values close to the Planckian locus, even for high luminophore concentrations. In contrast, luminophores that only absorb partly in the visible spectrum suffer from color distortion, a situation characterized by low CCT and CRI values, even at high transmittance.",Visible spectrum; Color temperature; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Color rendering index; Materials science; Luminophore; Luminescent solar concentrator; Planckian locus; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12060885,journal article,Utrecht University,nl

To this end, three-dimensional (3-D) sceneries are ray-traced in CAD. The PV power output is then modeled by translating irradiance intensity data of rendered images back into numerical data. To ensure accurate results, the solar irradiation data used as input is compared to numerical data obtained from rendered images, showing excellent agreement. As expected, also ray-tracing precision in the CAD software proves to be very high. To demonstrate PV energy yield simulations using this innovative concept, solar radiation time course data of a few days was modeled in 3-D to simulate distributions of irradiance incident on flat, single- and double-bend shapes and a PV powered computer mouse located on a window sill. Comparisons of measured to simulated PV output of the mouse show that also in practice, simulation accuracies can be very high.

To overcome this drawback, it required to maintain the operating temperature at standard test conditions. The working temperature of the BIPV can be kept at a higher efficiency end by the usage of phase change materials (PCM). However, the heat transfer rate of conventional PCM is very poor and can be enhanced by using thermal conductive nanoparticles. The present study has been effectuated to show the effect of various nanoparticles on the operating temperature of the BIPV. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis taking into cognizance the heat and mass transfers in a system made of a nano-enhanced PCM attached to the back of a BIPV has been conducted. The n-octadecane has been considered as base PCM material which is mixed with four different nanoparticles at three different concentrations. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), Copper (Cu), Copper oxide (CuO), and Titanium dioxide (TiO2), have been used as the nanoparticle to augment the thermal conductivity of PCM. The result showed that the addition of nanoparticle in an appropriate amount considerably reduced the operating temperature of BIPV for a longer duration of time. The maximum temperature reduction is obtained with Cu nanoparticle and minimum with TiO2. The panel temperature can be maintained below 40°C for about 60 min. with Cu nanoparticles at 5 % concentration. At the same concentration, Cu will take maximum time i.e. 56 min. to melt completely. The three days numerical simulation at the actual weather conditions of Raebareli (26.2345° N, 81.2409° E) has also been conducted with the Cu nanoparticle and it was noticed that the insertion of nanoparticle in the PCM reduced the operating temperature of the PV panel as compared to the pure PCM.

The objective of this work is to compare the real performance (experimental data obtained under real sun during a year) of a commercial hybrid PV-T system vs. a simple PV system using microinverters, assessing the suitability of one-unit hybrid PV-T systems vs. two separated units – PV systems + Thermal systems – for building integration. The combined efficiency over the span of a full day could reach values up to 80%, but this apparent high value needs to be analysed in detail. From the experimental results, it can be observed that both systems, PV and PV-T, have a good electrical performance. But the PV-T system output does not benefit from the lower module temperatures that it should achieve from the active cooling in its back, presenting the same performance as the simple PV system. Regarding the microinverters configuration performance, it has been very positive working with high efficiencies above 96%, justifying its use in this type of applications. In conclusion, the commercial PV-T system has not performed as expected, showing problems with the integration of the active cooling in the back of the PV modules.

Nevertheless, it currently is predominantly operating in a niche market of ~ 1% of the global photovoltaics market. In this paper we provide a thorough Multi Criteria Decision Analysis of the BIPV ecosystem (markets, stakeholders, and policy and legislation) in various European countries, i.e. the Netherlands, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Environmental legislation and building requirements were found to be similar, as all countries have the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in common. It was found that implementation of the EPBD differs per country, evidenced by different support schemes in effect. Also, harmonisation of building codes hampers BIPV development. The analysis provides a basis for developing a BIPV ecosystem, which may differ per country.

1354,053-352-458-621-485,Impact of shading on a flat CPV system for facade integration,2016,"Abstract Recently adopted energy efficiency policies in the EU induce a movement towards energy-neutral buildings. Building integrated photovoltaics technology connects with this ambition, as aside from the generation of electrical energy, it allows additional benefits such as heat generation, or daylight regulation by transmission of diffuse sunlight through transparent parts of the system. In this study three Concentrator Photovoltaic (CPV) system configurations that allow for the construction of semi-transparent building facade elements are investigated outdoor. The systems are a Fresnel lens based concentrator, a novel flat planar optic concentrator, and a 4 × 4 panel of these flat optics. The flat optic has no air cavity to account for optical focal depth which is highly beneficial when incorporated in a window. In particular the energy production of the systems when partially shaded is investigated, as adjoining systems will move behind one another during sun tracking, because the optics spacing must be small to achieve good daylight regulation. The planar optic concentrator is found to display similar performance as a Fresnel lens based concentrator of similar concentration. For a multi-receiver panel, shading introduces a loss of performance ranging from 7% to 12% which is attributed to electrical interconnection as individual receivers do not suffer this loss.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optics; Planar; Daylight; Concentrator; Efficient energy use; Facade; Fresnel lens; Heat generation; Computer science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2016.11.001,journal article,Radboud University Nijmegen,nl

The experiment was conducted as part of the Car as Power Plant project at The Green Village in the Netherlands. The main objective was to assess the end-user's potential of implementing FCEVs in vehicle-to-grid operation (FCEV2G) to act as a local energy source. FCEV2G field test performance with a Hyundai ix35 FCEV are presented. The car was adapted using a power output socket capable of delivering up to 10 kW direct current (DC) to the alternating current (AC) national grid when parked, via an off-board (grid-tie) inverter. A Tank-To-AC-Grid efficiency (analogous to Tank-To-Wheel efficiency when driving) of 44% (measured on a Higher Heating Value basis) was obtained when the car was operating in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode at the maximum power output. By collecting and analysing real data on the FCEV power production in V2G mode, and on BIPV production and household consumption, two different operating modes for the FCEV offering balanced services to a residential microgrid were identified, namely fixed power output and load following. Based on the data collected, one-year simulations of a microgrid consisting of 10 all-electric dwellings and 5 cars with the different FCEV2G modes of operation were performed. Simulation results were evaluated on the factors of autonomy, self-consumption of locally produced energy and net-energy consumption by implementing different energy indicators. The results show that utilizing an FCEV working in V2G mode can reduce the annual imported electricity from the grid by approximately 71% over one year, and aiding the buildings in the microgrid to achieve a net zero-energy building target. Furthermore, the simulation results show that utilizing the FCEV2G setup in both modes analysed, could be economically beneficial for the end-user if hydrogen prices at the pump fall below 8.24 €/kg.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Zero-energy building; Microgrid; Hyundai ix35 FCEV; Vehicle-to-grid; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Load following power plant,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.038,journal article,Delft University of Technology,nl

Previous studies applied the ray-tracing technique, which gives accurate results, but is time-consuming. Our approach uses the rasterization technique and enables therefore real-time simulation. It includes shadow simulation for multiple surrounding objects with various shapes and can handle movements of the 3D objects during the simulation. The isotropic irradiance model of Liu and Jordan is implemented and it gives useful results. The tool can calculate the power output of PV cells, based on the actual PV parameters extracted out of the datasheet given by the PV manufacturer. In addition, it accounts for irradiance and temperature dependencies of the PV cells. A validation is carried out based on short time-series.

Their flexible shape adds to the aesthetics of the surroundings as well as allows to place them over objects where conventional solar cells might not fit.

In this paper, we present the application of topology optimization (TO) to optimize the front metallization patterns for free-form solar cells. TO distributes the electrode material on the solar cell front surface in an efficient manner, such that the total power output is maximized.

To achieve this, the chapter discusses the results of the second part of the survey presented in the previous chapter, which addresses the perceived potential and specific issues for the integration of solar technologies. General results point to economic aspects as the main barrier to overcome, followed by particular issues related to current limitations of components and architectural products.

1361,137-459-777-805-391,Partially shaded III-V concentrator solar cell performance,2018,"Abstract Currently, an important concern in CPV is inhomogeneity of the light distribution on the cell introduced by the applied optical systems, which may affect system performance. In BICPV applications, the inhomogeneities can be much more severe because of design constraints introduced by the building incorporation. Additionally, one of the predominant loss mechanisms in CPV solar cells is perimeter recombination. In this study, the electrical parameters of CPV cells are investigated under inhomogeneous illumination intensity profiles. Partial shading is used as a model for extremely inhomogeneous illumination, while several shadow patterns are used to study the effect of perimeter recombination on the cell performance. As the latter occurs most strongly in GaAs subcells, shallow and deep junction GaAs CPV cells have been developed and subjected to these experiments, as well as commercial triple junction CPV cells. Deep junction GaAs cells are shown to perform significantly better under concentrated light than their shallow junction counterparts. A large degree of shading exceeding 70% has been found to cause only minor losses in the cell performance of 4%. Also, the cell performance is found to be independent of the location of illumination, in spite of perimeter recombination effects, because the current density spreads out. Clearly, increased illumination inhomogeneities caused by elaborate BICPV optical systems, do not inhibit the electrical performance strongly. As a consequence, a large degree of design freedom exists for the optical systems, which offers good opportunities to develop BICPV that meet all the design challenges of the built environment.",Concentrator; Shading; Materials science; Current density; Triple junction; Solar cell; Electrical performance; Shallow junction; Optoelectronics; Intensity (heat transfer),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2017.11.039,journal article,Radboud University Nijmegen,nl

However the conventional power configurations based on centralized, string and multi-string technology is difficulty to obtain high energy conversion efficiency, in severe cases, the hot-spot problem can arise and the photovoltaic modules can be irreversibly damaged due to their non-independent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) based on string or array. A DC-module-based BIPV system is proposed in this paper to solve these problems. The photovoltaic DC building modules as the core of the proposed system integrate photovoltaic module, high step-up DC-DC converter with MPPT function and facade elements, and decrease the system costs. Furthermore the individual MPPT of every photovoltaic module improves the anti-shadow performance.

Therefore, fossil fuel-generated electric power plants, that emit an enormous amount of greenhouse gases, can be replaced by the PV power plant. However, due to its lower efficiency than a traditional power plant, and to generate equal amount of power, a large land area is required for the PV power plant. Also, transmission and distribution losses are intricate issues for PV power plants. Therefore, the inclusion of PV into a building is one of the holistic approaches which reduce the necessity for such large land areas. Building-integrated and building attached/applied are the two types where PV can be included in the building. Building applied/attached PV(BAPV) indicates that the PV system is added/attached or applied to a building, whereas, building integrated PV (BIPV) illustrates the concept of replacing the traditional building envelop, such as window, wall, roof by PV. In India, applying PV on a building is growing due to India’s solar mission target for 2022. In 2015, through Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, India targeted to achieve 100 GW PV power of which 40 GW will be acquired from roof-integrated PV by 2022. By the end of December 2019, India achieved 33.7 GW total installed PV power. Also, green/zero energy/and sustainable buildings are gaining significance in India due to rapid urbanization. However, BIPV system is rarely used in India which is likely due to a lack of government support and public awareness. This work reviewed the status of BIPV/BAPV system in India.

A previous study has shown that a 1 °C increase in PV cell temperature results in a reduction of 0.5% in energy conversion efficiency; thus, the temperature factor is critical, especially to solar farm operators. The transpiration process also plays an important role in the cooling of green plants where, on average, it could dissipate a significant amount of the total solar energy absorbed by the leaves, making it a good natural cooling mechanism. It was found from this work that the PV system’s bottom surface temperature was the main source of dissipated heat, as shown in the thermal images recorded at 5-min intervals at three sampling times.

1368,002-752-061-315-212,A methodology to improve the performance of PV integrated shading devices using multi-objective optimization,2019,"Abstract Solar energy can be exploited efficiently in building facades using building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). This study presents a methodology to optimize the design of fixed, parametrically modelled PV integrated shading devices (PVSDs) based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) coupled with integrated thermal, electric, and lighting simulations. The goal of this work is to gain insight into the potential benefits of using optimization algorithms for PVSD design. This task is carried out by evaluating the extent to which competing solar energy uses can be balanced with regard to thermal, visual and electrical parameters; and investigating whether existing simulation tools successfully characterize the complexity associated with PVSDs. The methodology developed is used to design and assess the performance of different optimized configurations of a fixed exterior louvre PVSD installed on the southern face of an office building in a Nordic climate. The parameters used for the optimization were the number of louvre-blades as well as their individual tilt angle and position along the vertical axis. This allowed the introduction of a higher degree of eclecticism through the optimization process compared to standard shading systems. The three objectives of the optimization were the total net energy demand, the energy converted by the PV material, and the daylighting level in the zone measured as the continuous daylight autonomy. The results highlighted that configurations with smaller louvres counts were preferable for the specific case study and that optimization increased the performance of the PVSD compared to a reference case. The results of the study also demonstrated that the application of the proposed methodology was able to improve the exploitation of solar energy through a multi-domain facade, and thereby that advanced simulation tools, in this case, allowed overcoming the limitations of more standardized facade configurations. Based on these findings, it is assumed that methodologies like the one developed in this article can be a starting point to stimulate successful discussion and foster fruitful collaboration between researchers, stakeholders, and facade manufacturers, resulting in the development of innovative technological solar integrated facade solutions.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Control engineering; Daylighting; Energy (signal processing); Parametric design; Facade; Computer science; Process (engineering); Solar energy; Multi-objective optimization,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.033,journal article,SINTEF,no

In particular, Scottish homes today are conspicuous energy consumers emitting on average 3 ton-CO2 per house annually which is much higher than the UK average of 2.75 ton-CO2. The UK’s fuel poverty issue is on the rise. In fact, 26.5% of households in Scotland alone live in fuel poverty according to Scottish House Condition Survey 2008.

Despite the policy, the homebuilding industry today is barely ready for accomplishment of such sustainable housing agenda. Given the national and international challenges related to climate change and resource shortages, much more is required than incremental increases in houses’ energy efficiency.; To take the initiative to meet the societal needs, governmental expectations and industrial obligations, ROBERTRYAN Homes is currently developing design ideas and solutions towards the construction of zero-energy healthy houses.

However, in spite of technologic progress and economic evolution, diverse types of obstacles limit a large-scale advanced PV integration into urban renewal processes.; In this context, urban and architectural design towards increased integration – and therefore increased acceptance – provides an essential solution to overcome these barriers. It represents a key element towards establishing a systematic link between BIPV and the necessary renewal of the considerable existing building stock.

The integration of renewable energies in building elements can improve their overall performance, as they are able to replace common construction materials, while offering both electrical and thermal energy. The scope of this paper is to present the first results of an experimental study of a Building-Integrated Photovoltaic system combined with a water storage tank (BIPV-WS), a combined integration not extensively studied yet. Both layers are separated by a ventilated air cavity, and the thermal behavior of the system was analyzed experimentally in real functioning conditions. The water tank performs as a thermal storage, maintaining a regular temperature of about 20–30 °C during a typical winter day of Lisbon for a period of 11 h. Moreover, through the ventilation of the air cavity, the heat provided by the solar panel was naturally recovered to the indoors of the building, while keeping the temperature high enough to heat up the water. During summer, the ventilated BIPV-WS enabled beneficial nocturnal heat loss while delaying diurnal space heating.</jats:p>",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal; Water storage; Environmental science; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14092545,journal article,,no

One of the simplest and most direct applications of this energy is the conversion of solar radiation into heat, which can be used in water heating systems. A commonly used solar collector is the flat-plate. A lot of research has been conducted in order to analyze the flat-plate operation and improve its efficiency. The solar panel can be used either as a stand-alone system or as a large solar system that is connected to the electricity grids. The earth receives 84 Terawatts of power and our world consumes about 12 Terawatts of power per day. We are trying to consume more energy from the sun using solar panel. In order to maximize the conversion from solar to electrical energy, the solar panels have to be positioned perpendicular to the sun. Thus the tracking of the sun’s location and positioning of the solar panel are important.

In the U.S., Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) have been integrated into some limited, small-scale projects. However, BIPV’S are now being considered on larger scale building projects, as replacements for typical high-performance envelope materials, This is a result of improved economics, including higher module efficiency and lower cost of the PV cell product, The higher efficiency makes BIPV modules more attractive for non-solar normal orientations, and the lower costs and financing subsidies makes B[PV more equivalent in cost to high quality materials such as stone or metal panel. BIPV applications are still not quite well known in the building construction industry, even though the quality of the materials is going up and cost of the system is going down. When it is compared with common building materials, BIPV materials are still more expensive and don’t quite fit with the architectural design and construction process, Regular quality schemes for building materials such as constructability, structural properties, life expectancy, performance and aesthetic features have not been clearly defined for photovoltaic yet.

Accurately quantifying these effects could be the key to predicting reductions in solar availability which, in turn, can significantly affect daylight and the thermal performance of buildings, as well as the potential for PVs and other renewables sources.

Considering that the building envelope is today one of the most complex parts of a sustainable building, the “BIM-ization” of its construction process could potentially foster the challenge of a more sustainable built environment. This is particularly relevant for multifunctional systems producing energy such as “solar skins”. Typically, today the building process is highly fragmented so that the information flow is not linear, many information is lost, are missing or need to be re-entered with additional rework and request for information. An integrated and collaborative digital process would reduce efforts, time, repetitive work, risk of mistakes, information losses, etc., transforming an almost “manual” and fragmented work into an interoperable workflow along the value chain. BIM creates efficiency and users will get several benefits. Digitalization of solar building envelopes, since it is a multidisciplinary field, requires dedicated specifications on information modelling/management, process workflows, interoperability aspects and BIM levels to adopt. The paper will present an insight on the adoption of a BIM-based approach to ensure the reduction of process inefficiencies and unforeseen clashes for the implementation of BIPV building skins. Along with a review of the existing framework concerning the definition of a reference process for the PV value-chain, it will focus on the discussion of BIM requirements for solar building envelope systems and in a first definition of the information categories for the main Levels of; Development (LOD) of BIPV components. After presenting also a practical example of digitalization for a BIPV; customized module, both in terms of geometrical and information modelling, the paper will finally provide basic inputs concerning approaches to support real workflows for higher BIM maturity levels in BIPV sector.

At the same time, an increasing number of energy-efficient devices that are part of the building service systems – such as LED’s, electronic equipment, or variable speed motors for efficient operation of ventilation units and heat pumps – use DC internally. Consequently, direct coupling of PV generation with electricity storage and DC loads in a local DC network has the potential to avoid power conversion losses arising in conventional alternating current (AC) based systems. In addition to the more efficient use of local generation and storage, an independent building micro-grid can provide system reliability in case of power outage. In this work, we perform a first evaluation of potential efficiency gains of low-voltage DC versus AC distribution in residential buildings with PV generation and battery storage. We take into account high-resolution electric load and PV generation profiles for a net-zero energy building. We find that relative to a conventional AC system, a DC network improves energy efficiency by approximately 2% without storage and 4% with storage. Moreover, we analyse the sensitivity of the results to variations in PV system size and battery characteristics. We show that the benefit of the DC system becomes more significant with increasing local generation and storage and that energy efficiency improvement and building self-sufficiency are correlated. The theoretical analysis provides guidance for a lab-scale hardware implementation of a small AC/DC hybrid system, which is currently in preparation.",Stand-alone power system; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Direct coupling; Electricity; Efficient energy use; Photovoltaic system; Energy storage; Electrical load,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/mapping/view/pub:168647?lang=en,conference article,,no

However, at the same time, they raise tensions in capital investments and overall returns. “Solsmaragden” is one of such a commercial building, that is integrated with BIPV facade with the peak power of 127.5 kW and owned by Union eiendomsutvikling AS in Norway. In this paper, a lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) of BIPV facade integrated to “Solsmaragden” is investigated based on on-field recorded data after four years of operation (2016–2019). While formulating LCCA, numerous benefits from system power generation, societal and environmental benefits, and financial gains due to three different end-of-life material recovery approaches were also considered. The result based on the field monitored performance showed that the net present value (NPV), discounted payback period, internal rate of return and levelised cost of energy of the system is equal to 478,934 NOK, 22 years, 6% and 1.28 NOK/kWh, respectively. It is observed that the BIPV system as a building envelope material for different orientations of the building skin could reimburse not only all the investment costs but also become a source of income for the buildings.

1402,014-868-361-185-544,The Construction of a Mock-Up Test Building and a Statistical Analysis of the Data Acquired to Evaluate the Power Generation Performance of Photovoltaic Modules,2020,"Traditionally, studies on the power generation performance analysis of the photovoltaic (PV) modules used in building-integrated PV (BIPV) systems have been based on computer simulations and actual experiments with constraints, resulting in the results being inaccurate and limited. This paper proposes a two-step analysis method that results in a more versatile and reliable means of analysis. The steps are: (1) construction of a mock-up test building in the form of BIPV systems and the collection of a massive amount of operational data for one year; and (2) a statistical analysis of the acquired data using Minitab software (Version: 17, Manufacturer: Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA) to examine the power generation performance. The constructed BIPV mock-up applies design elements such as material types (c-Si and a-Si) and various directions and angles for different module installations. Prior to the analysis, the reliability of the large database (DB) constructed from the acquired data is statistically validated. Then, from the statistical correlation analysis of the DB, several plots that visualize the performance characteristics governed by design elements, including contour plots that show the region of higher performance, are generated. Further, a regression model equation for power generation performance is derived and verified. The results of this study will be useful in determining whether a BIPV system should be adopted in a building’s architectural design and, subsequently, selecting design element values for an actual BIPV system.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Mockup; Reliability (computer networking); Reliability engineering; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Insolation,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13071546,journal article,,no

In this sense, the so-called Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is a possible catalyzer, as PV is hidden (integrated) into building envelope morphologies that are familiar to the public. It is crucial to be able to design and assess a BIPV system so that its visual performance is optimal.

Thanks to the energy focus, this technology is becoming more efficient and affordable. However, despite this favourable context, Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) technology is not exploited to the best of its potential. Architects often justify the lack of PV use in their designs by the poor aesthetics of existing PV solutions, which have been hindering the development of BIPV.

Its ambition is to propose a new prospective basis for facade composition strategies, integrating architectural, constructive and technological issues.

The UK has seen rapid uptake reaching over 500,000 installations totalling 2.8 GWp by 2013. PV can be installed in different market segments (domestic rooftop, non-domestic rooftop and ground-mounted “solar-farms”) covering a broad range of system sizes in a high number of locations. It is important to gain detailed understanding of what grid-connected PV deployment looks like (e.g., how it deployed across different geographic areas and market segments), and identify the major drivers behind it. This paper answers these questions by developing a novel geographical information systems (GIS)-framework—the United Kingdom Photovoltaics Database (UKPVD)—to analyze temporal and spatial PV deployment trends at high resolution across all market segments. Results show how PV deployment changed over time with the evolution of governmental PV policy support. Then spatial trends as function of local irradiation, rurality (as a proxy of building and population density) and building footprint (as a proxy for roof-area) are analyzed. We find in all market segments, PV deployment is strongly correlated with the level of policy support. Furthermore, all markets show a preference to deploy in rural areas and those with higher irradiation. Finally, local clustering of PV in all market segments was observed, revealing that PV is not spread evenly across areas. This work reveals the complex nature of PV deployment, both spatially and by market segment, reinforcing the need capture this through mapping.",Software deployment; Environmental economics; Information system; Transport engineering; Rurality; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics; Distributed generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en9010026,journal article,,no

Following this trend, solar power would become the world’s largest source of electricity by 2050. Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, in which conventional materials can be replaced with PV panels that become an integral part of the building, can be enhanced with concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems. In order to increase the cost efficiency of a BIPV system, an optical concentrator can be used to replace expensive PV material with a lower cost option, whilst increasing the electrical output through the concentration of solar power.

Exterior shading is a common way to improve summer indoor thermal environment of the buildings in low latitudes. This study presents a BIPV/T solar water heating system for exterior shading of residences. In order to evaluate and optimize the system performances, a model was developed to simulate the thermal and electrical production of such system. The simulations for an example system in Guangzhou, a city in South China, were performed to investigate the influences of tank installation height and panel tilt angle on system performances. According to simulation results, the suggested tank installation height is 0.6~0.8 m. The shading coefficient ranges from 0.797 to 0.828 when the tilt angle varies from 14° to 38°. The reduction of panel tilt angle causes a certain improvement of shading performance. The annual auxiliary heat reaches the minimum when the panel tilt angle equals 28°, and the annual electric energy output changes little when the panel tilt angle ranges from 20° to 28°. Comprehensively considering thermal, electrical, and shading performances, the suggested panel tilt angle is 20°~28°. The average thermal and electrical efficiencies are respectively 38.25% and 11.95% when the panel tilt angle ranges from 20° to 28°.

1419,021-910-483-650-360,Automatic fault detection on BIPV systems without solar irradiation data,2014,"BIPV systems are small PV generation units spread out over the territory, and whose characteristics are very diverse. This makes difficult a cost-effective procedure for monitoring, fault detection, performance analyses, operation and maintenance. As a result, many problems affecting BIPV systems go undetected. In order to carry out effective automatic fault detection procedures, we need a performance indicator that is reliable and that can be applied on many PV systems at a very low cost. The existing approaches for analyzing the performance of PV systems are often based on the Performance Ratio (PR), whose accuracy depends on good solar irradiation data, which in turn can be very difficult to obtain or cost-prohibitive for the BIPV owner. We present an alternative fault detection procedure based on a performance indicator that can be constructed on the sole basis of the energy production data measured at the BIPV systems. This procedure does not require the input of operating conditions data, such as solar irradiation, air temperature, or wind speed. The performance indicator, called Performance to Peers (P2P), is constructed from spatial and temporal correlations between the energy output of neighboring and similar PV systems. This method was developed from the analysis of the energy production data of approximately 10,000 BIPV systems located in Europe. The results of our procedure are illustrated on the hourly, daily and monthly data monitored during one year at one BIPV system located in the South of Belgium. Our results confirm that it is possible to carry out automatic fault detection procedures without solar irradiation data.

The issue is acute as many of these complex technologies such as advanced building skins (ABS) are integrated with the building structure, rather than being bolt-on additions. Building integrated photovoltaic technologies (BIPV) are an example of ABS and pose challenges for construction professionals. Research has until now understood BIPV through idealised project management processes, but with little empirical research. Using a socio-technical approach, this research aims to understand the “real world” of construction projects and to explore how practitioners make BIPV integration a reality. This research follows three building projects where BIPV was specified, following the negotiations, decision making and institutional logics, which play out. The implications of project management demands and conventions on the integration of the technology are explored, identifying institutional obstacles to integrating BIPV into the building. Findings include changing interests and requirements shaping the technology, friction interfaces between the technology and the other building elements and conflicting priorities of project management conventions and technical details. The importance of this research is to deconstruct the practicalities of incorporating BIPV into building projects so that construction professionals, technology developers and suppliers can understand the challenges and opportunities occurring as ABS are integrated into the building envelope.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Empirical research; Engineering; Project management; Architectural engineering; Structure (mathematical logic); Building envelope; Negotiation; Emerging technologies; Photovoltaic system,http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/75880/,conference article,,no
1421,023-328-609-030-079,TILT AND ORIENTATION: APREFERENCE FACTOR AMONGPHOTOVOLTAIC ROOF SYSTEMS,2014,"One of the most abundant renewable energy resources is solar energy. In the construction sector, buildings are the largest human fabric intercepting solar radiation; they are a driving sector for developing solar energy uses especially those for generating electricity; Photovoltaics (PV). PV can produce on-site electricity with no harmful emissions. Generally, PV modules (PVs) are placed as a lay-on or additive solution to the building external envelope. Initially, they were secured to the roof or onto a facade using a metal structure with the sole function of generating energy. Afterwards, PVs were thought of as buildings components ""part of the building external envelope"", thus becoming multifunctional construction materials bringing “added value” to building materials. Hence, the idea of integrating PVs in buildings arose and the Building Integrated Photovoltaic systems (BIPVs) concept was introduced. There are various typologies of BIPVs and vast number of factors/constraints affects the dual usage of PVs as electrical elements and architectural ones. There is a lack of consensus in the methodologies used for the BIPV implementation; there is a minority of tools connecting these factors in a way that enables stakeholders analysing BIPVs alternatives, thus choosing the most appropriate one. Hence, it is obvious that designing with BIPVs requires a much more holistic perspective than what has been typically applied for decision-making in the past. This approach focuses on the interaction between BIPVs basics/characteristics, and the constraints affecting their suitability for application. The paper will focus on one factor (tilt and orientation) and its effect on one BIPV typology (roof systems). At the end of this paper, a preference matrix will be conducted which resembles the interrelationship between PV roof systems and tilt and orientation factor. The aim of paper is to provide architects with an effective supporting tool to analyse different BIPV alternatives for any building within a specific location, to choose the most appropriate BIPV system.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Roof; Facade; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,https://www.rroij.com/open-access/tilt-and-orientation-apreference-factor-amongphotovoltaic-roof-systems-.php?aid=46809,journal article,,no

A clear example of BIPV products consists of semi-transparent photovoltaic modules (STPV), designed to replace the conventional glazing solutions in building facades. Accordingly, the active building envelope is required to perform multiple requirements such as provide solar shading to avoid overheating, supply solar gains and thermal insulation to reduce heat loads and improve daylight utilization. To date, various studies into STPV systems have focused on their energy performance based on existing simulation programs, or on the modelling, normally validated by limited experimental data, of the STPV modules thermal behaviour. Taking into account that very limited experimental research has been conducted on the energy performance of STPV elements and that the characterization in real operation conditions is necessary to promote an energetically efficient integration of this technology in the building envelope, an outdoor testing facility has been designed, developed and built at the Solar Energy Institute of the Technical University of Madrid.

Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide currently, refers to photovoltaic cells that are integrated into the building envelope such as facade or roof to generate clean energy from sunshine and is the most remarkable technology to contribute to nZEB purposes. In this paper, an innovative approach of BIPV economic analysis is presented. The proposed method is to quantify the societal and environmental advantages of a BIPV system as much as possible and import these values to the economic analysis in order to see their effects in a lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA). In order to compare the results with the current LCCA, four case studies from Brazil, Italy, China, and Bahrain were chosen, because they were the most recent BIPV system LCCA, and the suggested method was applied on them. The economic analysis showed that with the societal and environmental benefits of the implemented system, replacing conventional facades and roof building materials with BIPV modules will become economically more feasible. As a result, the presented strategy could not only expectantly guide the end user to decide more conscious about the implementation of BIPV systems but also steer governments or decision-makers to support the technology by rational subsidies and incentives.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architectural engineering; Zero-energy building; Building envelope; Facade; Energy consumption; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Resource (project management); End user,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109461,journal article,University of Stavanger,no

By analysing the potential of BIPV's penetration in Chinese urban areas and a scenario analysis in Beijing, this paper addresses the questions (1) Is BIPV feasible in China? (2) If the Chinese government chooses BIPV, what are the pros and cons? (3) How can obstacles be overcome to implement BIPV?; ; In terms of current PV technology, a 5 kWp PV system occupying about 40 m2 rooftop area can produce c.a. 6 MWh electricity per year under average insolation levels in China. Given an approximate rooftop area in townships of roughly 4 billion m2 in 2003, installation of PV systems on just one third of these rooftops would enable annual generation of approximately 200 TWh. This represents 14% of Chinese annual electricity consumption in 2002 for BIPV or rooftop systems alone, independent of large concentrated solar facilities such as PV power plants. BIPV remains in its infancy or as a novelty in Chinese cities as demonstration projects and the potential of PV energy is far from full commercial exploitation. Globally, manufacturing capacity for PV cells recently exceeded 1 GW and the fastest increment of PV is the grid-connected PV system in residential rooftops, namely, BIPV in most cases.; ; The Chinese Renewable Energy Law (CREL) is a landmark of Chinese government's endeavour to construct a harmonic society and transition to sustainable patterns of development. It supports a reduction in consumption of fossil fuels and seeks to stimulate renewable alternatives. Aiming for the enhancement of CREL this paper also analyses the background, contents and limitations of this law. Correlative recommendations for further improvement are given based on successful cases in other countries. To promote the rooftop programme of BIPV, economic incentives are discussed by adapting the German Feed-in Tariff to a scenario of a ?100 000 Rooftop Programme? in Beijing, China.

Hence, high penetration of PV power into the system network can be observed in many points in the network. This may cause severe problems on the distribution network due to the intermittent nature of PV systems. As a feasible solution, the reactive power capability of voltage source inverter in PV systems can be employed rather than approaching expensive grid infrastructures in the distribution network. The purpose of this study is to implement a 3-phase grid-connected (BIPV) system with reactive power control to regulate the system voltage and improve the system power factor. Subsequent to this, a specific system model has been designed and developed in MATLAB Simulink application. The selection of PV system specifications is based on practical system implementation. The inverter control system along with the reactive power control has been developed for the proper system operation at different system conditions to reduce the var compensation on the utility grid. Better system accuracy of the developed system model has been found by validating with real system data. The overall system performance has indicated that the effective utilization of reactive power control of a grid-connected PV system yields to a stable, reliable and cost-effective system network operation which reduces the heavy burden on the utility grid to control the PV system effects.",System model; AC power; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Inverter; Automotive engineering; Control system; Grid; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Power factor,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.075,journal article,University of Agder,no
1432,027-888-293-097-429,Design of a Mobile Probe to Predict Convection Heat Transfer on BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) at UTS (University of Technology Sydney),2015,"In the absence of a simple technique to predict convection heat transfer on BIPV (building integrated photovoltaic) surfaces, a mobile probe with two thermocouples was designed. Thermal boundary layers on vertical flat surfaces of a PV (photovoltaic) and a metallic plate were traversed. The plate consisted of twelve heaters where heat flux and surface temperature were controlled and measured. Uniform heat flux condition was developed on the heaters to closely simulate non-uniform temperature distribution on vertical PV modules. The two thermocouples on the probe measured local air temperature and contact temperature with the wall surface. Experimental results were presented in the forms of local Nusselt numbers versus Rayleigh numbers ""Nu = a·(Ra) b "", and surface temperature versus dimensionless height (Ts - T∞ = c·(z/h) d ). The constant values for ""a"", ""b"", ""c"" and ""d"" were determined from the best curve-fitting to the power-law relation. The convection heat transfer predictions from the empirical correlations were found to be in consistent with those predictions made by a number of correlations published in the open literature. A simple technique is then proposed to employ two experimental data from the probe to refine empirical correlations as the operational conditions change. A flexible technique to update correlations is of prime significance requirement in thermal design and operation of BIPV modules.

1433,027-907-638-346-680,Improvement of the Performance of Self Cleaning Solar Panel,2011,"This study aims to give a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the self-cleaning glazing products available on the market today and investigate methods for measuring the self-cleaning effect. Various future research pathways and opportunities for the self-cleaning products of tomorrow are also explored within this study, with emphasis on solar energy application areas such as daylight, solar radiation transmission, electrochromism, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar cell glazing and solar cells in general. Self-cleaning products from several manufacturers that utilize two different self-cleaning technologies of either photocatalytic hydrophilic or hydrophobic capability are presented. 1.INTRODUCTION: The objective of this paper is to attain a clear overview of the self-cleaning glazing products available today, to investigate methods for measuring the self-cleaning effect, and to explore various future research pathways and opportunities for the self-cleaning glazing products of tomorrow. To comply with these purposes, this study is divided into three parts. The first part suggests and investigates possible methods for measuring the cleaning effect of self-cleaning glazing products. The second part is a state-of-the-art review of all the large self-cleaning glazing manufacturers and their available products of today. The third and last part is a possibility study of the research and development being performed on the subject as of now, in addition to illustrate possible solutions and products for the future. The products in question in this study are mainly glass components and applications to such, e.g. windows and window treatment products. Nonetheless, the potential for self-cleaning surfaces in general, including ice and snow free surfaces, is huge. Therefore this study also encompasses various wall and roof surfaces, photovoltaic solar cells, solar thermal panels, cars, road signs, etc. As the name suggests, a self-cleaning glazing is capable of cleaning its own surface. This effect can be achieved through photocatalytic reactions within a titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin film coating. However, the thin-film must be activated to be operational. The activation occurs by virtue of UV radiation, where the TiO2 reacts with the oxygen and water molecules in the air and produces free radicals leading to oxidative species [1]. This process needs some daylight exposure, usually about one week, to ensure full activation. When dirt, dust and other deposits later may fasten to the surface as a result of natural weathering, the UV radiation causes oxidative species that results in photogenerated electrons and holes. Electrons will then reduce oxygen to water (vapor) and holes will oxidize the organic matter, and thereof deteriorating the dirt and dust [1,5]. Since UV radiation is abundant even on cloudy days or in shaded areas, this process is in operation non-stop during daytime. To perform measurements in the field without disturbing factors such as changing solar conditions, one could do the testing during nighttime, as the only light source to power the solar cell on the inside would be the measurement lamp on the outside, more or less. If not, an apparatus that is attached on the outside of the test specimen, which block out all solar radiation and only allow the measurement lamp to transmit light through the specimen and power the solar cell on the inside of the specimen. Furthermore, the test room in which the solar cell is placed should be arkened. If one follows the mentioned considerations and precautions when evaluating the selfcleaning factor in accordance with either Equation 2 or 3, the results should give a good indication on the self-cleaning effect of the test specimens, within the measurement accuracy. The relationship between the traveled distance of radiation and the transmittance of radiation may thereof be defined as: I = Io exp(-αx) → T = (I / I0) = exp(-αx) (1) where I and Io are defined as the incident and transmitted radiation intensity, respectively, α is the absorption coefficient of the substance, x is the traveled distance of the radiation, whereas T represents the transmittance of radiation through the substance. Consequently, the transmittance of light through a dirty self-cleaning glazing product will decrease exponentially with increasing thickness of the deposit layer. The SunClean self-cleaning coating can be used in conjunction with solar control glass, in order to achieve a high energy efficiency and other benefits in addition to the self-cleaning property. The SunClean coating is a durable and transparent coating of titanium dioxide that is factory applied to hot PPG glass panes during the formation process, creating a strong and long-lasting bond between the coating and the glass. This process makes the coating an integral part of the outer surface and yields a durable photocatalytic and hydrophilic surface, which is easy to clean, dries quickly and causes minimal spotting and streaking.The SunClean is dependent upon UV radiation, as any other photocatalytic surface, in order to function correctly, and is therefore only used externally. The energy within the UV radiation is able to disintegrate organic dirt and dust, however, the coating is not able to loosen inorganic deposits, such as sand or paint and cement runoff. Occasional cleaning and maintenance is necessary, also in periods with little or no rain to wash away loosened deposits. Still, the sheeting-action of water on the glass surface enables quick cleaning with minimal effort.

In open loop air-based BIPV/T systems outdoor air is drawn by a variable speed fan into the channel formed by the PV modules and an insulated envelope layer. The open loop nature of the system is such that large temperature differentials exist between the interior side of the PV module and the bulk temperature of the air flowing in the BIPV/T channel. The experimental outdoor BIPV/T system studied in this paper has a length/hydraulic diameter ratio of 38 which is representative for a BIPV/T roof system. Experimental results show significantly higher Nusselt number as compared to pure forced convection heat transfer in pipes when the air is drawn through the BIPV/T system with a variable speed fan. The calculated Rayleigh and Grashof numbers are high and confirm that the system operates in the mixed convective regime for the tested Reynolds number range.,Convection; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Nusselt number; Grashof number; Bulk temperature; Thermal; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Mechanics; Thermodynamics,https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/ihpbc/25/,journal article,,no

1441,032-821-440-102-051,Adaptive Facades System Assessment: An initial review,2015,"The assessment of adaptive facades presents a challenge because there is no established evaluation strategy to systematically reach this goal and many of the available building energy standards and codes have limited applicability for such advanced facades system. This paper reviews current evaluation methods for assessing adaptive facades system through a literature review. It also discusses occupant behaviour, post occupancy evaluation and commissioning issues and presents the procedures. The paper is part of the activities of Working Group 3 in COST Action TU1403 - Adaptive Facades Network. So far we could not find a protocol for assessment of adaptive facades. The reviewed literature is scattered lacking a focus on adaptive facades. There is no agreement on defining what are adaptive facades (sometimes named intelligent, smart, dynamic). We could define specialized technology monitoring techniques to assess the performance of technologies such as fabric-integrated solutions (e.g. electrochromic glazing, phase-change materials, building-Integrated Photovoltaics with heat recovery (BIPV/T, shade shutters) and advanced controls.

1442,033-057-016-509-78X,Overview of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems in Hong Kong,2005,"Alternative energies, other than fossil fuels, are the one of the logical ways for reducing green house gas emissions and for sustainable development. Hence, in recent years, governments all over the world have been stepped up their push in exploring more opportunities in this area. Photovoltaic (PV) technology is, of course, one of promising candidates in alternative energies in most parts of the world. It is predicted that the cumulative worldwide installed PV capacity will reach 70GW by 2020 [1]. To cope with the problem of high initial cost of PV installations, the concept of building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) has been introduced; such that the PV panels can be used for serving purposes of some standard building components other than generating electricity. By this way the marginal cost of a PV system can be greatly reduce to a more acceptable level. In Hong Kong, a number of medium-scale BIPV systems were completed in last few years. These BIPV projects included government building, commercial building, schools, institutional building. The power rating the BIPV system for each project is in the order of tens of kilowatts. Most of these BIPV systems are girdconnected type to eliminate the bulky and troublesome battery banks. Some of these projects are retrofitting on existing buildings; while some are parts of a new building. The paper will give some details on the design of these PV systems.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Retrofitting; Grid connection; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Photovoltaics; Marginal cost,http://ira.lib.polyu.edu.hk/handle/10397/1677,conference article,,no

The building envelope is completely covered by photovoltaic modules. The eight-storey apartment house was built in 1965 and was in poor condition after 45 years, when it was decided that refurbishment would be advisable. The target set by the owner was to renovate the building totally and to achieve the passive house standard. At the beginning of the construction phase the builders raised the goal even higher, and decided that the application of BIPV modules to the entire facades could achieve the Plus energy house standard (netZero Energy building). ; In addition to the BIPV facades, a single-axis tracking photovoltaic system was also installed on the pergola roof terrace in October of 2013, as a final option. Solar thermal collectors (vacuum tubes) are also used to reduce the heating demand and to increase the COP of the heat Pump.; This paper describes the building before and after renovation, and discusses the critical points in the planning phase and during construction of the 45kWp BIPV ventilated facades.; Moreover, in order to assess the mechanical stability of the glass-glass a-Si module assembly on the facades, mechanical stress tests were performed in the SUPSI laboratories.

In the Europe, the United States, Japan and other country research about BIPV is actively being carried out and marketability is also being infinity expanding. Arch type PV systems efficiency characteristics is different depending on PV array's directly connection, parallel connection and arches angle, but is a lack of analysis on this nowadays.

1446,037-488-134-291-750,Colored PV modules based on Interference Filters,2018,"Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has the potential to play a major role in the ongoing transition towards nearly zero energy buildings. However, the BIPV market is still a niche market, representing only 1% of the global PV share. One of the main barriers that hinder the deployment of BIPV is the lack of aesthetic flexibility. Architects and designers are often reluctant to embed PV systems in buildings due to their unsuitable color. In this thesis, the use of interference filters (IFs) as color coating solution for PV modules is proposed. IFs are optical devices designed to selectively reflect a narrow portion of the visible solar spectrum while transmitting the remaining part. The structural coloration provided by the filter is highly dependent on the angle of incidence of the light. This angular dependence could be an issue for BIPV applications, since color homogeneity is often an important requirement. The objective of this work is to model, fabricate and assess the opto-electrical performance of colored crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV modules based on interference filters, with the final goal of increasing the aesthetics of this technology. First, the angular resilience challenge is addressed. Simulation results show that texturing the glass surface significantly improves the color stability, thanks to diffuse reflection of light. Very high angular resilience up to 80o can be achieved with a double-side texture profile made of hemispherical grooves. Secondly, five interference filters deposited on different glass substrates are used to fabricate 10 x 10 cm² c-Si colored mini-modules. The optical characterization of the demonstrators allows to partially validate the optical model and confirm the good angular resilience of the textured surfaces. Finally, the electrical performance of the mini-modules is evaluated. I-V measurements show that IFs only affect the short-circuit current of the mini-modules due to optical losses. Depending on the color and the topology of the surface, absolute efficiency losses range from 0,95% to 4,6%.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Structural coloration; Zero-energy building; Electronic engineering; Colored; Crystalline silicon; Coating; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Diffuse reflection,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A3a1c078d-f9e0-4817-8758-a0b56a14bf18,journal article,,no
1447,037-970-661-312-424,Battery Capacity Estimation for Building Integrated Photovoltaic System: Design Study for Different Geographical Location(s),2017,"Abstract Building Integrated Photovoltaic system (BIPV) with energy storage (ES) can help in reducing the peak demand, improving the power quality and control dispatching of the power. Adding a proper size of battery ES to the grid-connected PV system could reduce the overall investment cost as well as reducing the grid-dependency. A typical battery energy storage capacity is going to be determined by considering the real-time operational (PV production as well as load consumption) data. In this study, real-time operational data of a residential load (C6 house) with BIPV system located Southern Norway as well as institutional load (Teri university) with BIPV located in New Delhi, India are used for estimating the size of the battery energy storage considering the maximum reduction in the annual electricity bill. The estimation of battery capacity is done considering the characteristics of lead-acid battery technology and the electrical pricing mechanism. Based on the results, it is observed that for these typical PV and load profiles, installation a capacity of 2100 Ah lead-acid battery to C6 house will reduce the annual electricity bill by 17.6 % of the bill before installing the battery. Similarly, the annual electricity bill is minimum for a battery capacity of 6000 Ah for Teri university. If this battery capacity (6000 Ah) is added, then the annual electricity bill is reduced by 5500 Indian rupee INR.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Installation; Peak demand; Automotive engineering; Electricity; Production (economics); Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Battery (electricity); Energy storage,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.12.226,journal article,University of Agder,no
1448,038-375-954-533-407,BIPV pricing in the Netherlands: 2014 Price benchmark report,2015,"In this benchmark we investigated the price levels of the Building Integrated Photo-Voltaics (BIPV) market in the Netherlands. There is a broad scope of different BIPV applications (e.g. roofing, facades, skylights, glazing, etc.). This study limited itself to the applications for pitched roofing in the Dutch residential sector. Two types of BIPV applications (tiles, in-roof systems) were compared to conventional roofing and conventional Building-Attached Photo-Voltaic (BAPV) roofing solutions. Suppliers of BIPV systems were invited to quote on a virtual home with the target to make the house net electricity zero. Two virtual homes were defined. The first virtual home was a terraced house with 60 m2 roof area and 3300 kWh/a electricity usage. The second virtual home was a detached house with 125 m2 of roof area and 4600 kWh/a electricity usage. The quotes were split up in various categories including electrical connection costs (cables, inverter, AC connection), PV installation costs, PV fastening system costs, PV panels costs, Installation costs, and conventional roofing materials costs. In total, 11 quotes for BIPV systems were received. These were well-distributed over the two categories of BIPV in-roof systems and BIPV tiles. In addition, 8 quotes on conventional BAPV systems were gathered for price comparison. It was chosen to report the turn-key prices for the full roof upgrade rather than the common unit of €/Wp, because only in this way a clean comparison between the various solutions to make the house net electricity neutral could be made. From the analysis of the prices, the following key conclusions can be drawn: - Turn-key prices for retrofitting a BAPV system and make the house net electricity neutral are €6,000 for a terraced and €8,000 for a detached house. BIPV in-roof mounting systems add €2,500 to these costs, due to three main effects: o Additional labour is required due to the removal of the existing roof tiles. o Suppliers of BIPV in-roof mounting systems tend to choose high quality European brand PV panels in their systems, whereas BAPV system suppliers tend to choose low-cost Asian brand PV panels. o More costs are made in the installation process, due to a more complicated and slower installation process than BAPV systems. - Turn-key prices for renovating a full roof and then adding a BAPV system to make the house net electricity neutral are €10,000 for a terraced and €16,000 for a detached house. BIPV in-roof mounting systems add €1,000 to these costs. Cost savings are made for requiring less roof tiles, but additional expenses are needed for the use of more expensive high quality brand PV panels and longer installation times required. - Several suppliers of BIPV tiles are active on the Dutch market. Their products are meant to blend better into the roof’s optical appearance and consequently improve the overall aesthetical quality of the house. A large price spread within the products that are offered exists. The cheapest BIPV tile solution for a turn-key roof renovation was €14,000 euro for a terraced and €21,000 euro for a detached house. The most expensive solution was €23,000 euro for a terraced and €35,000 euro for a detached house. The large price range suggests a proto niche market or sub-segmentation within this product group. - Comparing the dwelling types with each other we see an overall price advantage in favour for larger roof systems. The electricity producing roof on a detached house was approx. 20% cheaper per m2 than the same system on a terraced house, for all three system types of BAPV, BIPV in-roof systems and BIPV tiles.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Business; Architectural engineering; Single-family detached home; Electricity; Roof; Niche market; Retrofitting; Price level; Terraced house,https://repository.tudelft.nl/view/tno/uuid:406b6380-de69-432b-98ae-b64c3c6557cd,journal article,,no

The limitations on fossil energy resources, made our country find another alternative, that is to evolving renewable energy potential for solutions to meet energy demand. Some renewable energy resources that can be evolved in Indonesia are solar energy, hydro energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, and biofuels. This study focused on the use of solar energy systems, namely photovoltaics.

Holistic design strategies for renovation projects with buildingintegrated photovoltaics (BIPV): case study from the 1900s in Neuchâtel (Switzerland).,2017,"As the majority of buildings that will exist in 2050 are already built, with many of them having a low level of energy performance, urban renewal processes play an essential role towards the sustainable development of cities. In this context, BIPV systems can potentially provide a crucial response to the energy turnaround targets. Functioning both as envelope material and electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and GHG emissions while providing savings in materials and electricity costs. Focusing on the architectural design, this paper presents the results of a multi-criteria evaluation in terms of Life-Cycle Assessment and Cost of different renovation scenarios, integrating into the design process: (1) Passive strategies, to improve the envelope through low-embodied energy materials and construction systems; (2) BIPV strategies, using innovative photovoltaic products as a new construction material for facades and roofs; (3) Active strategies, adapting HVAC systems to improve their efficiency by maximizing the consumption of the energy produced on-site. The research methodology presented in this paper, through a representative case study of an archetypal building from the 1900s in Neuchâtel (Switzerland), proposes a new way to address rehabilitation projects of existing buildings in urban environments.

1456,040-617-386-714-840,A holistic approach to assess the exploitation of renewable energy sources for design interventions in the early design phases,2018,"Abstract This study presents a holistic approach applied to assess the exploitation of renewable energy sources for design interventions in the early design phases in a consolidated urban environment. Concerning the cooling season, the approach implies set of environmental analyses focused on twofold assessments: (i) the use of renewable energy sources for active and passive strategies, (ii) the impact on outdoor thermal comfort of the technological solutions and cool materials installed on the buildings’ facades. From the definition of the local boundary conditions, preliminary climate analyses were conducted with dynamic simulation tools such as Ladybug and DIVA-for-Rhino, while numerical and computational fluid dynamic models, such as ENVI-met and OpenFOAM, were used to carry out microclimate and wind flow analyses. The approach is tested on two existing residential building blocks in a case study district in Bolzano (Italy). The assessment of several design interventions and building technological solutions have been studied: from the (i) addition of one-story volume on the existing buildings, to the (ii) creation of new green areas, and the (iii) installation of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), vertical greenery and double skin facade (DSF) systems on the building's facades. The results, divided into practice and policy implications, demonstrate that preliminary analyses play a relevant role to assess the exploitation of renewable energy sources to optimize the use of urban and building surfaces since the early design phases. High-albedo materials on the facades can counterbalance the loss of solar potential due to the overshadowing effect of the additional story. The combination of cool materials (e.g., white reflective plaster) and the increment of the buildings’ height could reduce by about 1°C the thermal discomfort registered during the high thermal peak during the day. Solar and urban airflow analyses allow optimizing the integration of BIPV in a DSF system; while the installation of green facade can reduce the air temperature locally by up to about 0.5°C.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal comfort; Dynamic simulation; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Double-skin facade; Facade; Microclimate; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.06.066,journal article,Norwegian University of Science and Technology,no

In this context, Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, using innovative PV products as new construction material for facades and roofs, can potentially provide a crucial response for achieving long-term carbon targets. This paper presents an integrated architectural design process for addressing renovation projects. Presented through a comparison of two case studies on archetypal residential buildings from the 1900s and 1970s in Neuchâtel (Switzerland), this approach includes the design of different renovation scenarios integrating passive, active and BIPV strategies. An optimization of the potential BIPV (or active) surfaces based on the annual irradiation threshold is conducted to maximize self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS).

To evaluate the yearly energy yields of vertical PV systems facing different orientations, four 1.116kWp triple junction amorphous silicon (a‐Si) PV systems were mounted on the four facades of two buildings facing the North, East, South and West respectively. For the comparison, another same a‐Si PV system was horizontally mounted on the rooftop and tilted at 12° facing the South. The operational data of the five PV systems in a year were monitored and collected to analyse their performance under the same weather conditions.

1462,047-054-345-556-442,A Review on Building Integrated Photovoltaic Facade Customization Potentials,2017,"Technological advancement in Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has converted the building facade into a renewable energy-based generator. The BIPV facade is designed to provide energy generation along with conventional design objectives such as aesthetics and environmental control. The challenge however, is that architectural design objectives sometimes conflict with energy performance, such as the provision of view and daylight versus maximum power output. In innovative cases, the characteristics of conventional BIPV facades have been modified by researchers to address such conflicts through customization as an emerging trend in BIPV facade design. Although extensive reviews exist on BIPV product types, design integration, adoption barriers and performance issues, research on BIPV customization has not been reviewed as a solution to BIPV adoption. This paper seeks to review the potential of BIPV facade customization as a means of enhancing BIPV adoption. The current paper identifies customization parameters ranging from the customization category, level, and strategies, and related architectural potential along with an assessment of their impact. The findings reflect that elemental and compositional level customization using combined customization strategies provide enhanced BIPV products. These products are well integrated for both energy generation and aesthetic applications with a power output increase of up to 80% in some cases. The paper concludes that a wide range of BIPV adoption barriers such as aesthetics, architectural integration, and performance can be overcome by appropriate BIPV customization.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Daylight; Architectural engineering; Personalization; Renewable energy; Product type; Facade; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9122287,journal article,,no

In cold climate regions, we predict that there will also be a growing focus on how to avoid snow and ice formation on the exterior surfaces of BIPV. During the winter period there is substantially less incident solar radiation. This is also the period when the solar radiation is most needed for heating, lighting and power production purposes. The task to avoid accretion of snow and ice is challenging due to the fact that snow, ice and ambient weather conditions exist in countless variations and combinations. Snowfall, freezing of rain water and condensation of air moisture with subsequent freezing, are examples of aspects that have to be addressed in a satisfactory way. The present study aims to review the cold weather challenges facing BIPV, the strategies for overcoming them and the opportunities that follow from successfully overcoming them.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Meteorology; Moisture; Snow; Accretion (meteorology); Ice accretion; Cold climate; Cold weather; Ice formation; Environmental science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2019.110306,journal article,Norwegian University of Science and Technology,no

Hence, the tendency lives in the PV community to evaluate the performance on the energy yield and not purely on the efficiency. The major drawback is that weather conditions play an important role, and recording solar spectra in different orientations is an expensive and time-consuming business. We, therefore, present a model to calculate the daily, monthly and annual energy yield of Si-based PV installations included in commercial panels as well as tandem solar cells. This methodology will be used to evaluate the benefit of potential new technologies for domestic and building integrated applications. The first advantage of such a numerical model is that the orientation of solar panels and their properties can be easily varied without extra experiments. The second advantage is that this method can be transferred to other locations since it is based on a minimum of input parameters.

The results of the energy performance simulations on the current state were compared with those deriving from the installation of the new envelope made of BIPV glass block panels.

1471,051-074-709-030-103,BIPV Visual Assessment for Architecture Retrofitting,2013,"Typical architecture designers convey through vague and qualified notions. With the increasing number of PV installations on buildings, architects are forced to corporate with technicians and engineers in the design processes. However, the communications between them are often hindered because unlike architects who communicate through semantic descriptors and visual images, engineers are used to interact with quantified terms. One way to solve this problem is adapting visual impact assessment for PV installed on facade so that one can foresee and evaluate its final overall effect in a way that is comprehensible for both sides. The visual impact assessment is a method mainly used in landscape design for evaluating the influence manmade changes caused on natural landscape. Now it is vastly used on aesthetic assessment for wind farms being built on open landscapes all over the world. Comparing with wind farms, the relevant researches for Photovoltaics are rather underdeveloped. The estimation of visual effect created by integrating solar energy components on open landscape is rarely investigated, let alone on architecture where it is more complicated because more aesthetic factors are involved. With the increasing number of Photovoltaics installed or to be installed on architecture facades, it is necessary to develop a rational visual assessment tool to better evaluate the appearance outcome of the final installation. Based on summarizing research experiences and literatures from former visual impact assessments, this paper tries summarize the possible factors that are relevant for AIPV installation, and changes and extensions on existing theories are being made when necessary. The final results will benefit architects, engineers during the planning process, and eventually for law regulator in laying down clear and reasonable urban planning regulations regarding installing PV in urban areas. In the end, the author will apply the visual impact theory on a retrofitting project where AIPVs are assigned to be installed on a church in Lucerne, Switzerland.",Landscape design; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Impact assessment; Architecture; Engineering; Natural landscape; Architectural engineering; Retrofitting; Facade; Urban planning,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/195700,conference article,,no

Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the performance loss factors of BIPV and to examine the characteristics of each performance loss factor. Measured data were used to analyze the performance and loss factors (module temperature, dust and soiling, power conditioning system (PCS) standby mode, direct current–alternating current (DC-AC) conversion loss). A performance ratio of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61724 was used to power the generation performance analysis. The impact analysis of each loss factor is analyzed by using difference of the power generation, the module efficiency, irradiation, and the performance ratio according to the existence of a loss factor. The performance ratio analysis result of this BIPV system shows a range of 66.8–69.5%. The range of performance loss due to each loss factor was as follows; module temperature: 2.2–6.0%, dust and soiling: 2.2–23.1%, PCS standby loss: 4.9–15.7%, DC–AC conversion loss: 4.1–8.0%. Because the effects of the loss factors are different depending on the installation conditions, the performance loss of the system should be minimized by taking this into consideration in the design stage in the BIPV.</jats:p>",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Loss factor; Power performance; Test facility; Window system; Environmental science,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app8091645,journal article,,no
1476,054-330-725-785-222,Assessing the Challenges of Changing Electricity Demand Profiles Caused by Evolving Building Stock and Climatic Conditions on Distribution Grids,2015,"Due to the foreseeable further electrification of heating and cooling demand in buildings their electric load demand will likely increase. For these reasons it is essential to reduce the energy demand of buildings, and optimize it by using renewable energy sources (RES) in conjunction with suitable storage elements, such as thermal energy storage (TES). These two factors will, however, drastically change today’s observed “typical” building load demand profiles. Higher peak load demand during cold and hot weather conditions as well as significant PV power production on sunny days will induce new challenges for electric distribution grid operation and planning such as more frequent and higher power spikes. These challenges will be assessed and possible mitigation options, i.e. the usage of storage elements, discussed in this paper. The paper presents the energetic analysis of an office building, the Solar Energy and Building Physics Laboratory (LESO-PB), located in the EPFL campus in Lausanne. The building’s ener getic model was realized with the software CitySim, and validated with on-site monitoring for the time period 2011 to 2013. Further analysis shows its thermic behaviour in future climatic scenarios (IPCC model for the year 2100, scenarios B1, A1B and A2). The e lectrical load demand of the building and the electricity production by the BiPV system can be optimally matched, during the different months and hours of the day, by means of thermal and/or electrical energy storage. This enables the maximization of the building’s selfconsumption from PV power production.

This has increased public interest in and development of building integrated photovoltiac (BIPV) systems. One such BIPV solution is the PowerWindow by Physee. Even though the PowerWindow does not produce asmuch power as a traditional rooftop installed photovoltaic solution, it can still be viewed as a step in the right direction to achieve sustainable development. This thesis project aims at modelling the energy yield of the PowerWindow by developing a simple framework with optical, thermal and electrical models. This thesis also evaluates the electrical characteristics of the PowerWindow under solar simulators. Furthermore, opto-electronic parameter values like current, voltage, reflectance and so on found through experimentation are used as input to the models. The optical model deals with a ray tracing approach to find the incident irradiance on the solar cells inside the PowerWindow. This incident irradiance along with the weather data is used for the development of a thermal model to predict the temperature of the solar cells using a fluid dynamic approach. To model the electrical characteristics of the PowerWindow, a one diode equivalent circuit is used. However, the current source is modified to incorporate the effects of inhomogeneous irradiation on and the temperature of the solar cells. The results of this work show that the maximum power produced by the PowerWindow, currently manufactured by Physee, is approximately 3.5 W under a solar simulator. This work also compares the incident irradiation profiles of all the edges of the PowerWindow, which produce power on different days, orientations and locations. The effects of shading on the PowerWindow is evaluated in terms of irradiation and is found to be present only in the summer months in Eindhoven. Furthermore, the daily energy yield calculated for a typical summer, winter and overcast day in Eindhoven is found to be 13, 5 and 3 Wh. It was concluded that a west and east facing PowerWindows in Eindhoven produce more energy in the summer and less in the winter as compared to a south facing PowerWindow. Additionally, the most performance effective circuit configuration is found to be the one with both blocking and bypass diodes.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Maximum power principle; Solar simulator; Equivalent circuit; Current source; European union; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Irradiance; Engineering physics,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ac26a5edd-5c45-4e1a-bc1c-22b745be19fb,journal article,,no

BIPV products are evolving from the basic architectural integration towards multifunctional products, aggregating essential PV requirements with additional requirements from the building skin such as thermal insulation, solar control, fire safety, water tightness, etc.; However, to effectively enter the building market, the BIPV products will necessarily have to respect the goal of cost-effectiveness as well as the compliance with adequate quality, safety and reliability levels. In this context, the H2020 project ""BIPVBOOST"" is focused on obtaining a reduction in costs along the entire value chain by pursuing product and process innovation, thus supporting the BIPV implementation in a wider mass market of the built environment. In addition to a technological development, it is essential to solve the interconnection between PV product standards, construction industry standards and specific rules for the installation and use in buildings. The EN 50583-1:2016 and EN 50583-2:2016 made a first step in this direction by defining the properties and the applicable regulatory framework for PV systems modules used as construction products. Nevertheless, the current regulatory framework collects norms created for standard PV or, on the other hand, for “non-active” building elements, so that a significant progress regarding BIPV qualification is still needed, and it represents a current barrier for the market access. It arises the need to identify new “multi-disciplinary” reference requirements, to improve the definition of the performance levels and to develop new test methodologies better suited to the use of PV in the building skin. Therefore, these issues will be addressed within the project by identifying the gaps in the current standards and by implementing a performance-based approach for the qualification of BIPV products. The paper, summarizing the first investigations of the project, will provide an overview on the current normative framework, reporting the main missing gaps and a roadmap to define new reference procedures for BIPV products qualification, setting the basic ground for next developments in the coming years.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Risk analysis (engineering); Built environment; Mass market; Quality (business); Context (language use); Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Product (business),https://repository.supsi.ch/11333/,conference article,,no

The proposed methodology is based on similar attempts worldwide, however taking into account more specific statistical data, performing accurate technical audits, and using recent data from the PV market a better approach is achieved. Furthermore, this methodology is used to evaluate the BIPV potential of the industrial buildings at Oinofyta-Viotias industrial zone as a case study. The photovoltaic installations in Greece are still increasing, due to high financial incentives provided by the three Greek government laws (3468/06, 3734/09, 3851/10) and due to the support offered by the EU. However, almost no industrial BIPV systems have been installed in Greece, while in the other EU countries they are rapidly developing.

It produces electricity from a 110.5 kWp building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system where heat is also recovered from a section of the array and used to preheat the outdoor air intake. The building's many architectural and mechanicalfeatures were integrally designed to achieve the net zero energy target over a five-year averaging period with several key decisions made at the early design stage. These include the shape, area, and orientation ofthe roofthat maximizes electricity productionfrom the BIPV (part BIPV/T [building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal with heat recovery]) system and a design layout that promotes daylight penetration and natural ventilation/free coolingduring the cooling season. In thefirstyear after inauguration, an operational energy use intensity (EUI) of 24.8 kBtu/tfy (78.1 kWh/m2y) was achieved and has since been reduced to 22.20 kBtu/fy (70.0 kWh/m2y). Considering renew-ables production, the net-energy use intensity (EUI) is 4.60 kB tu/ fi2y (14.5 kWh/m2y). This is a 95% EUI reduction over the national institutional average and can be further reduced with additional (ongoing) commissioning efforts. Suggested improvements in operation include ensuring the electricity production is optimized and any faults corrected, dimming electric lighting when daylight is sufficient, extending the hours of natural ventilation, and better utilization of the hydronic radiant slab for thermal storage using predictive controls. This paper discusses the process followed in the design of the library, its key features, its early performance, and some of the lessons learned.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Heat recovery ventilation; Automotive engineering; Thermal energy storage; Zero-energy building; Natural ventilation; Electricity; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,https://ir.library.carleton.ca/pub/25152,journal article,,no

Most of the energy comes from fossil fuels which are also depleting in a fast manner. Buildings consume a significant amount of energy all over the world and the demand for energy is also increasing unremittingly in buildings. Developed countries are taking profound measures in order to make buildings energy efficient and sustainable by achieving nearly zero energy stage. Pakistan is facing a serious energy crisis from the past few decades. The building sector in Pakistan deserves special attention in this regard since the energy consumption in buildings in Pakistan is feverishly high. Many types of research have been carried out in Pakistan by the United Nations and Energy Department of Pakistan in order to devise applicable methods that not only provide thermal comfort to the occupants but also make a building energy efficient. Renewable energy also plays an important role in compensating building energy demands. It is easy to achieve nearly zero energy state in a good energy efficient building if it is coupled with renewable energy sources then it will make it self-sufficient in energy demand. A survey is also carried out to determine the thermal comfort of the occupants in different types of areas. Also, solar energy analysis is also taken into account to highlight the solar power potential in Pakistan.

There are two main reasons for this: the lack of technical analysis and economic reasons. Manufacturers and investors utilize datasheets of modules to determine the systems performance, which is determined at standard test conditions (STCs). However, there are apparent differences between STCs and outdoor measurements. Most studies in the field of BIPV system analysis have only focused on long-term outdoor measurements. Besides that, uncertainty of measurements is necessary to achieve scientific results. The aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of measurement uncertainty, to describe how measurement uncertainties are calculated, and to find out the uncertainty of an outdoor BIPV measuring system. In this study, different roof-integrated photovoltaic systems with 15, 30, and 45 inclination angles were tested in the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology measurement field.

Therefore technologies and methods for reducing energy utilization in buildings are being developed throughout the world. Energy efficiency and conservation are two important aspects as it takes a larger stack in running the buildings, which is being highlighted in the „Green Building‟ concept. In urban buildings, energy is required mostly for lighting and air conditioning. In terms of lighting, daylighting and less energy intensive lighting devices like LED, CFL etc. are being used. Use of renewables like solar energy for power generation and also for air conditioning were also found to be used in buildings. Recent researches are based on using the building itself or its parts like roofs, facades, windows etc. for utilizing solar powers using technologies like Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) and Building Integrated Solar Thermal (BIST).

1492,063-135-016-468-50X,A Holistic Strategy for Successful Photovoltaic (PV) Implementation into Singapore’s Built Environment,2021,"<jats:p>Based on the findings from a recent study by the authors which examined factors affecting diffusion of photovoltaics (PV), while comprehensively considering the local PV and construction industry as well as characteristics of the built environment, this paper proposes a holistic strategy for PV implementation into Singapore’s built environment. It consists of (1) a multilevel mechanism framework, encompassing eleven mechanism categories of instruments and activities and (2) a general design framework including design principles, general project instructions and the main design guidelines. Relying on a survey conducted among PV experts on established mechanisms, the present study suggests that building codes (e.g., fire safety, structural safety, etc.) and initiatives and incentives related to PV/building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) should be the highest priority for authorities, followed by assessment of BIPV/PV properties, working toward social acceptance, conducting research projects and information exchange, and education and training activities. Considering all three pillars of sustainability, the design framework is based on the following interrelated design principles: (1) compatibility and coherence with the local context, (2) technical soundness, (3) economic viability, (4) user-centered design, (5) connecting with community and socio-cultural context, and (6) adaptability and flexibility. Despite Singapore’s scarcity of land, the established design guidelines cover a wide spectrum of solutions, including PV integration into both buildings and non-building structures. The synthesis of the two interconnected and inseparable frameworks aims to create an environment conducive to long-term widespread PV integration and stimulate the deployment of BIPV, which should help Singapore and other cities reduce their dependency on imported fossil fuels, while also making them more livable and enjoyable.</jats:p>",,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13116452,journal article,,no
1493,063-302-957-284-265,SIMULATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF A BIPV/T SYSTEM COUPLED TO A HEAT PUMP IN A RESIDENTIAL HEATING APPLICATION,2008,"Building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) systems consist of photovoltaic arrays incorporated seamlessly as a functional part of the building envelope; while generating electricity, they also make use of a circulating fluid (often air) for recovery of useful heat from the incident solar radiation. This has the additional benefit of cooling the photovoltaic panels, consequently improving their efficiency. For open loop BIPV/T air systems, although the air is considerably heated, its temperature often remains too low for direct use in building space heating applications. However, it is usually adequate to serve as the source of a heat pump. This paper presents the results of a simulation used as a decision-making tool in the system configuration design and the selection of the heat pump model to be coupled to the BIPV/T roof of a net-zero energy house. The simulation took into account the performance of several key elements of the house (BIPV/T, air-to-water heat exchanger, heat pump, storage tank) and manufacturer's data.

1494,063-618-841-371-085,Architectural design scenarios with building-integrated photovoltaic solutions in renovation processes: case study in Neuchâtel (Switzerland),2016,"In view of the importance of urban renewal processes, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems can potentially provide a crucial response to the energy turnaround challenges. Functioning both as envelope material and electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases emissions while providing savings in materials and electricity costs. However, despite continuous technological and economic progress, the assets of BIPV remain undervalued in the current practice. Various obstacles (technology choice, small volumes, lack of information and good examples) tend to increase the costs and reduce the project acceptance. To overcome these barriers, an interdisciplinary research project developed an approach based on four main phases: 1) selection of archetypal residential buildings, 2) detailed analysis of the buildings, 3) development of renewal design scenarios and 4) multi-criteria assessment of each scenario. Focusing on the architectural-scale, this paper presents design strategies with BIPV solutions of a representative case study realized in Neuchâtel (Switzerland). A multi-criteria assessment of the proposed design scenarios allows comparing the different strategies.

1495,063-800-218-104-314,Building integrated photovoltaic products: A state-of-the-art review and future research opportunities,2012,"Abstract Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) are photovoltaic (PV) modules integrated into the building envelope and hence also replacing traditional parts of the building envelope, e.g. the roofing. In this context, the BIPVs integration with the building envelope limits the costs by serving dual purposes. BIPVs have a great advantage compared to non-integrated systems because there is neither need for allocation of land nor stand-alone PV systems. This study seeks to outline various commercially available approaches to BIPVs and thus provides a state-of-the-art review. In addition, possible future research opportunities are explored. The various categories of BIPVs may be divided into photovoltaic foils, photovoltaic tiles, photovoltaic modules and solar cell glazings. Silicon materials are the most commonly used, and a distinction is made between wafer-based technologies and thin-film technologies. In addition, various non-silicon materials are available. The main options for building integration of PV cells are on sloped roofs, flat roofs and facades. The evaluation of the different BIPV products involves, among others, properties such as solar cell efficiency, open circuit voltage, short circuit current, maximum effect and fill factor. It is expected that the BIPV systems will improve in the years to come, regarding both device and manufacturing efficiency.

Photovoltaic (PV) frameworks offer a promising answer for clean neighborhood power age and upgraded cooling as well as warming through common or constrained convection. In this paper we present the ""Ressources"" venture, an investigation of such segments created at a huge scope (for new form and repair). Ressources is essential for the French National Research Agency program committed to energy and structures. To date considers have zeroed in on 3 model structure envelopes involving normally ventilated twofold skin designs on genuine structures: two for single-family homes (at Moret-surLoing—EDF R&D site) and one for a place of business (at Toulouse—HBS Technal site). This paper centers around the last framework and first trial results got in summer 2011. Most European nations have set the objective of decreasing ozone depleting substance emanations by a factor of 4 by 2050 contrasted with 1990, and a 20% decrease by 2020 while expanding by 20% the portion of environmentally friendly power. The structure area represents an enormous segment of all out energy utilization, and subsequently upgrades in this field can contribute fundamentally to public destinations. Guidelines in France will require new structures from 2020 to be energy-positive (BEPOS). This requires upgrades to protection, latent energy stockpiling, and air-snugness, yet in addition an enhancement of electrical and warm energy creation, and co-age arrangements. This infers a redefinition of the envelope (rooftop and exteriors) routinely worried about protection and fixing, to incorporate dynamic (occasional or every day variety) and dynamic highlights (energy creation and increased ventilation). Photovoltaic (PV) frameworks offer neighborhood power age and temperature control by regular or constrained convection. The characteristic warming of glasslike silicone cells can be overwhelmed by regular (BIPV) or constrained (PV-T) convection. The exhibition of such coordinated PV frameworks is exceptionally touchy to the plan, and since the interest for PV frameworks completely incorporated into the structure outlines (veneer, rooftop) is still very later, scarcely any investigations are presently accessible regarding the matter. The Ressources venture intends to propel the comprehension of twofold skin setups. Three models were planned: one for a current place of business exterior and two for separated houses. The exterior design was chosen as it offers the biggest likely surface for BIPV. To date most twofold skin parts comprise of an essential structure veneer and an auxiliary photovoltaic exterior isolated by an air hole, together involving a sunlight based smokestack to drive common ventilation or cool both PV and building envelope, while creating power during the time of numerical and test assessments on LHS by moving limits like warmth move fluid (HTF) inlet temperature, HTF stream rate, and material of the PCM compartment.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Envelope (motion); Architectural engineering; Building envelope; Asset (economics); Scope (project management); Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Temperature control; Plan (drawing),https://www.iomcworld.org/abstract/fullscale-experimentation-on-building-an-integrated-photovoltaic-componentrnfor-naturally-ventilated-doubleskin-configur-60287.html,journal article,,no

With current developments in energy efficiency of new and renovated buildings, and the coupling of heating and electricity demand through heat pumps, the long-term load forecast cannot be based on its historic pattern anymore. This paper presents part of an on-going work aimed at improving forecasts of the electric load profile on a national level, based on a bottom-up approach. The proposed methodology allows to account for energy efficiency measures of buildings and introduction of heat pumps on the aggregated electric load profile. Based on monitored data from over 100 non-residential buildings from all over Norway, with hourly resolution, this paper presents panel data regression models for heat load and electric specific load separately. This distinction is crucial since it allows to consider future energy efficiency measures and substitution of heating technologies. The data set is divided into 7 building types, with two variants: regular and energy efficient. The load is dependent on hour of the day, outer temperature and type of day, such as weekday and weekend. The resulting parameter estimates characterize the energy signature for each building type and variant, normalized per floor area unit (m2). Hence, it is possible to generate load profiles for typical days, weeks and years, and make aggregated load forecasts for a given area, needing only outdoor temperature and floor areas as additional data inputs.",Work (thermodynamics); Civil engineering; Energy (signal processing); Grid; Efficient energy use; Aggregate (data warehouse); Environmental science; Term (time); Panel data; Electrical load,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jup.2019.03.004,journal article,SINTEF,no

Although there may be many circumstances that bring about cracks in BIPV modules during the installation process, identifying the degradation of PV module efficiency resulting from the effects of cracks tends to be a very difficult task unless actual indoor or outdoor tests or detailed electroluminescence imaging tests are conducted. Many current studies have demonstrated that cracks may or may not impact the output performance of PV modules depending on the damage levels or where the damage is located. For BIPV applications such as replacement for building materials, there is still a lack of information and case studies addressing crack issues in a quantitative manner for evaluating BIPV output performance. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of cracks in BIPV modules on power outputs and to identify detailed relationships between the cracks and power output based on experimental and simulated analysis. An experimental facility located in Daejeon, South Korea, was used to gather data from cracked and non-cracked BIPV modules. By using the field-measured data and facility’ information, a simulation model was developed using SolarPro software, and a simulated-based analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of cracks in BIPV modules on output values after proper validation of the model. The results from this study reveal that cracks in BIPV modules exhibit significant degradation in BIPV modules’ outputs of up to 43% reduction during the experimental period. From the annual comparative results, output degradations of 34.6–35.4% were estimated when the BIPV modules included cracks.

Additionally, during the process of performing the tasks, the quarterly reports were delivered to show the progress of the project and analytical result for validation of simulations. Thus based on the progress reports, the main results and achievements of this project within the given time frame are as follows: • Previous simulations of ZigZagSolar was calibrated and validated based on the analytical data from the experiment. • A Design Support Tool (specified for the BIPV facade systems) was developed. Also the first mockup of the model was delivered. • Business plan and business model of the ZigZagSolar were developed based on the potential customers in Middle East. • An annual analytical performance monitoring report for ZigZagSolar was prepared based on the data from the experiment and validation of simulation results. The project aimed at supporting the development of these two innovative BIPV facade systems by improving the awareness of the customers. In addition, making the connection between research outcomes and technological design opportunities in the form of a design support tool was one of the important targets. The motivation of preparing a design support tool was formed because, company would be able to better introduce and sell this product at the target markets by using such tool. Therefore, this project wanted to do these four main following objectives: 1. Further investigation of PV integrated solar facade systems and their potential to generate power, with the help of experimental validation and calibration of a simulation model. 2. Generate and suggest new ideas as an approach to whole system design for these types of BIPV facades. Additionally, develop a design support tool based on the results. 3. Explore business applications based on scientific data from simulations and experiments. Which provides a better understanding of the techno-financial performance of the whole project to the owners, and a better value proposition to future customers. 4. Bridge the gap between real market needs and what is provided by companies as solution and prepare a platform to ease the process of selling the product based on system function awareness of consumers. As conclusion, there is still a need to verify the accuracy of the design solution provided in PDEng project with follow up projects. Therefore, it is suggested to produce the first version of Design Support Tool and apply it for the current client in a period of at least three months.

1505,073-169-349-723-183,Performance Enhancement of Building Integrated Photovoltaic Module using Thermoelectric Cooling,2013,Performance of solar panel decreases with increase in the temperature of the panel. Output power of PV module drops by 0.45% per 0 C rise in temperature if heat is not removed. In Building Integrated Photovoltaic System (BIPV) temperature rise is more as heat transfer due to convection is not possible from rear side of the panel. Cooling of the modules would enhance the performance of the module. In order to cool this system thermoelectric system is developed. Thermoelectric module is attached at the back of PV module and it is operated in cooling mode. This paper discusses about the development of BIPV/Thermoelectric system. Initially mathematical modeling of individual systems is carried out. Later on the dynamic model of BIPV/Thermoelectric system with consideration of temperature of PV panel temperature has been developed.

1509,074-792-606-052-431,ABSTRACT THE POTENTIAL ELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITY OF BIPV IN HONG KONG,1997,This paper reports the analyzing results of the solar energy resource and potential electricity generating capacity from building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) systems in Hong Kong. The monthly average daily solar radiation on a horizontal surface and the daily sum distributions of solar radiation show that the solar radiation intensity is quite high in Hong Kong except the wet period from January to March. The mean annual global radiation is 4646.8 MJ/m2. The potential electricity generating capacity from BIPV systems is estimated to be 10.5 TWh which is about 35% of the total annual electricity supply (29.9 TWh) in Hong Kong in 1995 if the shadow facades of the high-rise buildings are excluded. The BIPV electricity prices are estimated and compared with the local grid electricity prices. The results illustrate a bright future for BIPV applications in the next century in Hong Kong.,Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Civil engineering; Meteorology; Mains electricity; Electricity; Generating capacity; Monthly average; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel4/5262/14261/00654339.pdf,conference article,,no
1510,074-940-655-436-556,An albedo irradiance model usable for bifacial PV modules based on LiDAR data and ray casting,2017,"Despite the fact that the price per watt-peak for photovoltaic modules are decreasing rapidly, there is a large population of people which have still not implemented photovoltaic technology in their everyday lives. An important reason why PV is still not the main source of electrical energy for these people is the uncertainty that comes with installing a PV system on the roof of a house. Consumers are afraid that an investment in a PV system will cost them too much money, while it will take a long time before their investment is paid back for. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the energy yield of PV systems before installation. By doing so, consumers will be more likely to see the benefits of a PV system, thus implementing the technology on their houses. This thesis aims to improve the accuracy of the annual energy yield estimation using LiDAR data and a new model for the albedo component of irradiance. LiDAR has been used to determine the irradiance on a surface previously, however, this thesis uses LiDAR data in the Unity 3D game engine, which enables the user to apply changes and build on the environment rapidly. This eliminates the disadvan- tage of LiDAR data, which is often outdated, thus missing crucial objects surrounding the location of the potential PV system. Ray-casting is used extensively to determine the sky view factor, view factor, shading factor and to determine the surfaces visible to the PV module. Being able to determine the sky view factor without doing any field work greatly reduces the time required to design a PV system. The albedo component is often neglected entirely when estimating the irradiation on a surface, while it may significantly contribute to the energy yield, reaching up to 10% of the total. The albedo com- ponent is mainly important for highly tilted PV modules or BIPV. The albedo component is also crucial for bifacial PV modules. Measurements have shown that the albedo of a material is not determined easily using a sample of the material along with two inversely installed pyranometers making up an albedometer. It has been found that the albedometer is only able to determine the specific albedo of a location for the weather condition and the time in which the measurement has been done. Extensive research has been done in order to determine the factors which have an influence on the albedo of a location. The spectral reflectivity of materials is expected to play an important role in finding a final model which describes the albedo factor accurately. In order to estimate the irradiance due to reflectance, first the irradiance on the surfaces that are visible to the PV module are estimated one by one along with the view factor of each of the visible surfaces to the PV module in question. Finally using the reflectivity of the material of each surface, the contribution of each surface to the irradiance on the PV module as a result of reflectance is summed up resulting in the albedo component of the irradiance. The same method is used for the back side of the PV module to determine the irradiance on the back side of a bifacial PV module. This research aims to play an important part in the automation of PV system design, striving to com- pletely eliminate necessary field work, while improving the accuracy of the predicted annual energy yield.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Pyranometer; Roof; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Irradiance; Lidar; Remote sensing; View factor; Albedo,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A9c619b7e-ea37-4f78-afd9-ccbfcc28ff9d,journal article,,no

Contrariwise, there are no natural oil resources in Cyprus; over 90% of the country's main energy is imported to the island which needs high financial government credit [1]. Indeed, high CO2 emissions and their side effects on the global environment as well as destruction role on the ozone layer are among major problems of using non-renewable energy. Considering the geographic location of North Cyprus, it has over 300 sunny days out of 365 days of a year; therefore, there is a considerable potential to integrate solar tracking systems into various parts of industrials or residential portions in the country. In a time when using more renewable sources of energy is important to decline obvious environmental problems, it seems to be beneficial to use photovoltaic systems such as ""Building Integrated Photovoltaic"". As housing consumes over 40 percent of the produced energy, local sustainable properties deal with enhancing the quality of dwellers life. Based on what has been discussed, the objective of this study is to achieve a high degree of efficient local energy through BIPV so to supply a proportion of buildings' heating and electricity power consumptions. The main concern is considering cultural patterns and local climate aspects in the design process so to reach to a suitable energy solution in each individual case. Accordingly, some criteria which directly affect the produced power ability of photovoltaic systems would be discussed, in particular, determining the direction, the slope of photovoltaic panels, shading, its integration with active solar systems, and buildings' form and facades. Additionally, as the case study, Coloured Building would be presented to show that how those mentioned solutions can integrate to the building in order to refine its energy consumption. Consequently, architects and designers, looking for buildings' self-efficiency and sustainability, should know how to incorporate photovoltaic systems to the building and to consider which criteria in this case. Indeed, the corporation between architects and other engineers who work on a common project is the key role in developing a construction toward a sustainable environment.</jats:p>",Electrical engineering; Environmental science; Electric power; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.38027/n352020iccaua3163632,conference article,,no

From 3D geodata to BIPV yield estimation: towards an urban-scale simulation workflow,2017,"The presence of vegetation can significantly affect the solar irradiation received on building surfaces. Due to the complex shape and seasonal variability of vegetation geometry, this topic has gained much attention from researchers. However, existing methods are limited to rooftops as they are based on 2.5D geometry and use simplified radiation algorithms based on view-sheds. This work contributes to overcoming some of these limitations, providing support for 3D geometry to include facades. Thanks to the use of ray-tracing-based simulations and detailed characterization of the 3D surfaces, we can also account for inter-reflections, which might have a significant impact on fac ade irradiation. In order to construct confidence intervals on our results, we modeled vegetation from LiDAR point clouds as 3D convex hulls, which provide the biggest volume and hence the most conservative obstruction scenario. The limits of the confidence intervals were charac- terized with some extreme scenarios (e.g. opaque trees and absence of trees). Results show that uncertainty can vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the urban area and the granularity of the analysis (sensor, building and group of buildings). We argue that this method can give us a better understanding of the uncertainties due to vegetation in the assessment of solar irradiation in urban environments, and therefore, the potential for the installation of solar energy systems",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Point cloud; Civil engineering; Vegetation; Workflow; Granularity; Urban area; Lidar; Solar energy; Remote sensing,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/226576,conference article,,no

In this study the design, development, manufacturing and testing of a novel building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) solar energy cogeneration system is discussed. Adhesives (ADH), resistance seam welding (RSW) and autoclaving (ATC) were identified as the most appropriate for fabricating BIPVT roofing panels. Of these manufacturing methods ADH was found to be most suitable for low volume production systems due to its low capital cost. A prototype panel, fabricated using ADH methods, exhibited good thermal performance. It was also shown that BIPVT performance could be theoretically predicted using a one dimensional heat transfer model and showed excellent agreement with experimental data. The model was used to suggest further design improvements.

1515,077-555-323-203-21X,Towards advanced active facades : The development of a new construction system combining passive and active design strategies,2017,"In Switzerland, as in many European countries, new energy directives focus on decreasing the carbon footprint of buildings by promoting passive and active energy strategies and systems. Among the latter, Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV), which function both as envelope materials and electricity producers, are rapidly improving their performance. However, their potential remains largely unrealized due to diverse barriers. Among them, the poor expressive qualities of many BIPV products are preventing architects from using these systems. In reaction, and with the goal of bridging the gap between technology and designers, a new facade concept has been developed integrating BIPV expressive issues. This is the Advanced Active Facade (AAF) concept, which results from analyzing the evolution of facade requirements and solutions over time. The AAF combines passive and active facade design strategies. This is to say; it simultaneously aims to achieve low embodied energy by benefiting from passive low-carbon design strategies, and to generate energy by integrating BIPV technology. The AAF construction system is the direct application of the AAF concept to construction practice. It is a wood-based, self-supporting and demountable facade system, which meets the most exigent insulating targets and is compatible with a wide range of existing BIPV formats and emerging technologies. The development of this system is paired with a series of design strategies, which present a variety of scenarios where the AAF concept can be applied. In addition, his concept is assessed regarding its environmental impact, cost and architectural quality. The AAF construction system and design strategies have provided the basis for realizing a real scale active prototype. Ultimately, the output of the research will provide architects with a system and assessed design strategies to optimize design process of BIPV facades, meeting the new energy directives performance standards.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architectural engineering; Embodied energy; Electricity; Emerging technologies; Facade; Carbon footprint; New energy; Computer science; Design process,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/233746/files/Conference%20Paper%20SDBE2017_Cluas_Longas.pdf,conference article,,no
1516,077-883-388-235-40X,BIPV Education Initiative the Mackintosh School of Architecture,2008,"The implementation of the Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has the great potential to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) that considerably contributes to global warming, when building comes into operation. Moreover, buildings, where PV cells are well integrated, also provide non-economic benefits including the visual value of green architecture that helps gain the market acceptance. The needs for PV education at the schools of architecture, which generally train and generate future architects, are on the rise and the know-how to implement BIPV should be taught sufficiently at the design schools in response to societal needs for the 21st century architecture. Over the past ten years, the Mackintosh School of Architecture (Mac), which belongs to the Glasgow School of Art, has noted the embracing of ‘environmental sustainability’ in architecture as a core precept in the profession, as well as the education. In fact, in line with green building materials and systems that improve the energy-efficiency in building envelope, BIPV is well introduced to the undergraduate design studio course, as well as the postgraduate studies of energy and environment. In addition to the traditional lecture inputs, the architecture students are also invited to participate in the learning activities outside lecture theatres, such as a BIPV construction site excursion and design charrette, in order to guide the non-technical architecture students to thorough understanding of BIPV through experience. ; The ‘excursion’ involves a new setting, where students can actually experience subjects in question. As well, this provides an opportunity for reflective dialogue between teacher and learners and among learners. On 3rd-5th September, 2007, the Mac organised the PV Zero-carbon Mass Custom Home Mission to Japan, where 18 delegates from the government, industry and academia from the UK, France and China joined and 2 architecture students at the Mac are also among them. The participants visited not only the state-of-the-art production and sales facilities of 5 leading PV solar housing manufacturers in Japan—Sekisui Chemical Co., Misawa Homes Co., PanaHome Corp., SANYO Homes Co., and Sekisui House Ltd. . As well, the mission was also extended to the visit to a new solar housing community that is composed of total 120 homes equipped with PV systems—i.e. PV solar mass customised housing community. ; The design charrette was held at the former YMCA lodge in Wiston in March 2007, and provided the students with an interdisciplinary learning experience, where the environmental engineering and architecture students work as a team to actually design the lodge’s new bunkhouse that needs to be energy-efficient in response to the owners’ demands. Five design teams were organised and assigned to produce their own solar solutions. This design exercises took on a new sense of reality. Because of this transition, or simply chance, a scheme manifested itself over the weekend and it was not only practical to build, but also serene in terms of design and contextuality. All the multi-disciplinary teams have identical briefs, but each team is allowed to select their own site within the vicinity of the lodge. In the charrette, students are also given opportunities to experience user-friendly simulation tools that help identify PV performance in relation to the solar panel orientation and tilt under specified climatic conditions. The charrette creates a stimulative learning environment, where architecture students together with the engineering experience the implementation of BIPV.; This paper aims to identify architecture students’ learning activities of BIPV that is rarely taught at design schools in the UK today.

The vertically placed BIPV systems are able to cover larger areas of buildings’ surfaces, as compared with conventional rooftop PV systems, and reach their peak of production during winter and spring, which renders them suitable for energy harvesting especially in urban areas. Driven by both these relative advantages, the proposed strategy aims to maximize the district’s autonomy from the external grid, which is achieved through the cooperation of interactive buildings. Therefore, the major contribution of this study is the management and optimal cooperation of a group of buildings, each of which is equipped with its own system of vertical BIPV panels and BESS, carried out by an MPC strategy. The proposed control scheme consists of three main components, i.e., the forecaster, the optimizer and the district, which interact periodically with each other. In order to quantitatively evaluate the benefits of the proposed MPC strategy and the implementation of vertical BIPV and BESS, a hypothetical five-node distribution network located in Greece for four representative days of the year was examined, followed by a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of the system configuration on its performance.</jats:p>",,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14123369,journal article,,no

Due to the high installation location, BIPV modules suffer from lightning hazard greatly. In order to evaluate the risk of lightning stroke and consequent damage to BIPV modules, the studies on the lightning attachment characteristics and the lightning energy withstand capability are conducted, respectively, based on numerical and experimental methods in this paper. In the study of lightning attachment characteristics, the numerical simulation results show that it is easier for the charges to concentrate on the upper edge of the BIPV metal frame. Therefore, the electric field strength at the upper edge is enhanced to emit upward leaders and attract the lightning downward leaders. The conclusion is verified through the long-gap discharge experiment in a high voltage lab. From the experimental study of multi-discharge in the lab, it is found that the lightning interception efficiency of the BIPV module is improved by 114% compared with the traditional PV modules. In the study of lightning energy withstand capability, a thermoelectric coupling model is established. With this model, the potential, current and temperature can be calculated in the multi-physical field numerical simulation. The results show that the maximum temperature of the metal frame increases by 16.07 °C when 100 kA lightning current flows through it and does not bring any damage to the PV modules.

The nature of the building process – its methods and logic – are key factors affecting technological transfer, as seen in the steel and concrete industries, which have been the basis of modern architecture for the past century. In many cases, standardization would go against the case-by-case approach to design and the interdisciplinary nature of the field. Solar architecture therefore involves a synergic concept of constructive and functional correctness, while always engaging an “aesthetic intentionality.” So how can the market segment continue to drive down costs?",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architecture; Market segmentation; Architectural engineering; Standardization; Solar architecture; Constructive; Computer science; Correctness,https://repository.supsi.ch/11338/,journal article,,no

However, this improvement can be analyzed quantitatively only if the electricity yield generated by the BIPV system is calculated. This PhD thesis presents a simulation program that calculates the electricity yield generated by BIPV systems, including those made of geometrically complex BIPV modules. The simulation is based on a combination of a ray-tracing procedure with the resultant I-V curves of electrically connected PV cells. For the annual electricity yield, multi-core cluster computers are applied to perform the simulation on the basis of 5-minute meteorological data throughout a year. The ray-tracing technique is applied to calculate inhomogeneous irradiation, the consequence of shading or reflections from surrounding objects, and the quantitative relevance of reflections from the ground. The temperatures of the PV cells are calculated by taking the physical principles of heat conduction, heat convection and thermal radiation into account. The cell I-V curves are calculated depending on the temperature and the irradiance. After the virtual interconnection of the PV cells in the simulation, the effect of inverter efficiency and its dependence on the generator voltage are calculated, finally leading to the AC power of the BIPV system. All parts of the simulation are validated by comparison with measurements, and the accuracy of the simulation is quantified with the help of statistical measures. Finally, the simulation program is applied to calculate the electricity yield generated by two BIPV systems.",AC power; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Inverter; Engineering; Voltage; Thermal conduction; Electricity; Electronic engineering; Photovoltaic system; Mechanical engineering; Thermal radiation,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A3bd97b56-3edb-4071-8d5e-fe901b9d6e23,journal article,,no

Glass curtain walls are one the most popular building envelope systems in commercial development and there is much potential to incorporate emerging solar energy capture in facade technologies such as glass Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV). Facades present a larger surface area, for instance, if compared to the roof area. Singapore buildings are the second largest energy consumer after vehicles. If well managed, the built environment plays a pivotal role in mitigating high-energy consumption, enhancing environmental protection and improving user-centered and aesthetic qualities of the built form. This includes architecture, landscape and urban infrastructure. Singapore’s Sustainable Blueprint and Green Plan 2012 had set goals for the country to achieve economic growth and clean-living environment. With nearly 6 million people Singapore’s population has been increasing since its independence in 1965 however, its electricity consumption has been decreasing since 2012. This is being achieved through sustainability programs such as the Green Mark Scheme set by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) which is a government initiative. ; Methods: This paper is based on a critical review of Glass Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) technology. It also reviews market models for the commercial uptake of technological innovation.; Conclusions: This paper presents recommendations to accelerate BIPV uptake in the property market. In particular in the Singaporean context and geographic equatorial location with high solar incidence. It provides short and long-term strategy for policy development and practice including clients, developers, architects and other project consultants who take early project-decisions.

1527,086-232-257-267-919,Colored BIPV glass modules: the “price” of aesthetics,2016,"The use of renewable energy systems represents a crucial factor for realizing energy efficient constructions and achieving a significant energy and emissions savings in buildings. Photovoltaics (PV) is recognized as one of the most reliable solutions to be used in future buildings for producing electricity and transforming the building skin from a passive barrier towards a sensible, active and adaptive interface. In detail, Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) glass modules, used for transparent facades, skylights or balustrades, are a promising way to integrate solar energy into building envelope since they can contribute both in a passive and active way within the bioclimatic design. However, so far BIPV glass modules are still considered as a solution for exclusive constructions, due to design and installation complexity, additional requirements, higher costs in comparison to conventional photovoltaic modules and the “new” architectural language of the building skin.; Within this framework Smart-Flex is an European project that aims to overcome some of the barriers by means of the demonstration of the flexible manufacturing of multifunctional BIPV glass elements at the industrial scale and their use for “conventional” buildings. Indeed, an intelligent and automatic manufacturing process has been developed, as well as a novel digital printing for glass. Thanks to such innovations, it is possible to customize the BIPV glass modules with the desired geometry, patterns and colors to replace perfectly the conventional building envelope components. However, the partial covering of the BIPV glass modules due to the printing, on one hand, contributes to design the aesthetical appearance of the facade but, on the other hand, it involves a “price to pay” in the final power output.; Therefore, this paper focuses on experimental activities done by the authors to evaluate the electrical behavior of different colored modules developed in the framework of the Smart-Flex project with the goal to point out novel approaches for the customization and design of “active” coloured facades.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Building envelope; Digital printing; Efficient energy use; Facade; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics,https://repository.supsi.ch/7820/,conference article,,no

The Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BiPV) involves two main topics: construction technology and architecture. One of the keyaspects is the multi-functionality: PV becomes a constructive part of the building envelope that cannot be just considered as a single plant since it strongly characterize architecture, technology, energy behaviour and costs.; Despite in literature many examples show the high potential of PV integration in buildings, the complexity of the involved requirements do not always suggest the; BiPV as an easy option in the early design phase. Consequently PV is often postponed to a later stage of the construction to simply be adapted onto the building with the cheapest option. Purpose of the work, starting from a multicriteria approach, is to give a contribution concerning the economic assessment of BiPV, through the evaluation of costs and benefits in a life-cycle perspective. Results allow to appreciate the essential role of PV in the building envelope design confirming that in some cases BiPV is a cost-effective opportunity so that the economic worth joins the quality of the building.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architecture; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Work (electrical); Zero-energy building; Building envelope; Quality (business); Photovoltaic system,https://repository.supsi.ch/5747/,conference article,,no

The standard methodology with performance parameters such as energy yield (EY), yield factor (YF), capacity utilization factor (CUF), performance ratio (PR), and losses is used. It is found that the EY, YF, and year to year energy production variability of BIPV and BAPV technologies varies from 43,700–46,800 kW h, 1336.39–1431.19 kW h/kWp, and 1910–2100 kW h respectively.

1531,089-865-838-632-338,Identifying local PV shading in urban areas based on AC power and regional irradiance measurement,2017,"As the price of photovoltaic applications is decreasing, more and more PV is installed in an urban environment. Driven by the need for aesthetics and integration in building constructions, new BIPV products are developed, which opens the possibility to extend the usable area to almost any built surface. As a consequence of this, in the new era of BIPV applications, it is only natural that PV is installed on a surface that is regularly shaded. Furthermore, because of the increased capacity, it is expected, that the dependency of future buildings on on-site electricity generation will increase. These factors drive the need for accurate performance monitoring and fault detection methods, of which shade detection of PV applications is an essential element. A new method is developed, that relies on locally measured AC power and regionally measured irradiance data. By calculating the apparent Performance Ratio (aPR) and applying machine-learning algorithms on the measured AC power time series, locally shaded time periods can be identified, without local irradiance measurement. The method consists of 5 steps: Step1. Creating analemma graph of aPR  Step2. Eliminate data points, with cloud-shading.  Step3. Binarizing the remaining measurement points with an aPR-treshold.  Step4. Train Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the previously binarized dataset.  Step5. Use trained SVM to perform a soft-margin nonlinear classification of all data points recorded in the first step. With this method it is possible to distinguish between local and cloud-shading and - in case of a mono-pane installation - to plot the shading contour of the nearby objects, which is useful input for fault detection and monitoring of PV installations in an urban area. The next step is the validation of the method by on-site shading measurements.",AC power; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Support vector machine; Fault detection and isolation; Data point; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Irradiance; Real-time computing,https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/identifying-local-pv-shading-in-urban-areas-based-on-ac-power-and,conference article,,no

The vertical solar air collector is connected in series with the BIPV/T system to raise outlet air temperature in winter, and the wire mesh is placed in the channel behind the glazing of the solar air heater. A computer program is developed based on a mathematical model. Comparative analysis shows that the addition of wire mesh benefits efficiency at mass flow rates of less than 0.03 kg/s and that heat transfer enhancement depends on wire mesh geometry. The optimum mass flow rate of the wire mesh packed system is determined to be between 0.01kg/s to 0.03 kg/s; the efficiency is about 8.5% higher than that without the mesh, and outlet air temperature is typically increased by 4 °C to 11 °C.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Thermal; Electronic engineering; Computer program; Heat transfer enhancement; Mass flow; Photovoltaic system; Glazing; Mass flow rate; Mechanical engineering,http://www.solarbuildings.ca/documents/Investigation_of_performance_enhancement_of_a_building_integrated_photovoltaic_thermal_system.pdf,conference article,,no
1533,090-471-364-060-000,Studying the Dynamic Relationship between Energy Supply Carbon Content and Building Energy Demand,2016,"Electricity production is achieved by different processes (e.g. nuclear plants, fossil fuels sources, renewables, etc.) with different environmental impacts and capacities of production. To provide the necessary amount of electric energy demand, different sources of different quality are combined together and as a result, the carbon content of the electricity mix varies with time over the day and over the year. Likewise, the usage intensity and the design of a building induce variation of the energy demand at the same time. On the other hand, Switzerland proposes the 2050 energy strategy by fixing new policies to face climate change and decrease the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to point out the potential of a more dynamic relationship between low carbon content energy supply and building energy demand. To that end, three major steps are necessary and will be presented in this paper. The case study chosen to apply the proposed method is the building of the smart living lab, currently being designed and expected to be built by 2020 in Fribourg Switzerland, as it explicitly aims to achieve the intermediate 2050 goals of the 2000-watt society vision. Firstly, the hourly carbon content of the on-site available energies are evaluated. The Swiss electrical grid is assessed based on the accessible statistical data from the energy producers in Switzerland. The amount of renewable energy harvested by building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and its related environmental impact are evaluated with the solar tool PVGIS and the KBOB database. Secondly, the hourly energy demand is assessed thanks to dynamic simulation and to expected dweller usage of the building. Thirdly, the GHG emissions are assessed with the carbon hourly content of the energy supply that is used. The dynamic result is compared to a static approach that would use a yearly average carbon content of the energy supply. Also, the dynamic relationship between low carbon energy supply and building energy demand is analysed. The results of this study point out significant differences between a yearly static and an hourly dynamic GHG emissions assessment. Moreover, the important variation of the carbon content energy supply and of the energy demand demonstrate that a better correlation between these two is a powerful element to increase the performance of a building. In future studies, strategies such as electricity storage, BIPV orientation and tilt, and dweller usage variation should be further investigated.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Energy accounting; Environmental economics; Zero-energy building; Renewable energy; Efficient energy use; Energy supply; Energy conservation; Energy development; Environmental engineering,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/214870,conference article,,no

After analysing the characteristics of the main adaptive materials that are currently used for such applications, the contribution outlines the main features of the proposed system, which consists of thin film solar cells coupled with a thin layer of hygromorphic material, manufactured from two wooden slats joined together and produced from different types of wood and trunk cuts. The hygromorphic layer thus obtained can change its shape as a function of temperature and relative humidity of outdoor conditions, thanks to the different expansion coefficients of the two wooden slats.

The paper is dealing with the lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) of BIPV system in the capitals of all the European Union member states (EU) as well as the capitals of Norway and Switzerland. The results revealed that by a discount rate of zero, BIPV system could refund all the investment even on the north facades while in terms of traditional building envelope materials as an alternative option for building skins, there would be rarely added benefits after investment. Furthermore, the societal and environmental benefits of a BIPV system in Europe have its greatest impact on the south facade. Moreover, for all the studied directions of building skins with a discount rate of five present in Europe except the north facade, just the quantified amount of societal and environmental advantages of BIPV systems could almost reimburse all the invested money.

The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of a 1.5kWp CIGS BIPV system under these real-world environmental effects; dust accumulation, fauna droppings, natural shading and rig temperature. 5-minute measured data were obtained, over 4 months, and three clear sunny days (each for every month) were identified for analysis. Experimental results showed a qualitative relationship between the aforementioned environmental effects on the system efficiency. In particular, the effect of dust accumulation and bird droppings were the two identified dominant causes of the gradual decrease in the expected peak power output of the system. The effects of natural shading and temperature on the system efficiency were also presented in this paper. This study forms a solid foundation for further studies of the environmental effects on PV efficiency. This work is important due to the increasing uptake of PV systems in the NT and the understandings of these environmental effects enable such PV systems to be maintained efficiently.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Work (electrical); Shading; Building design; Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells; Roof; Northern territory; Photovoltaic system; Environmental engineering,https://espace.cdu.edu.au/view/cdu:49512,conference article,,no

The present paper seeks to discuss perceived barriers for widespread facade integration of solar technologies, in order to define the current scenario and generate guidelines for future developments.  In order to achieve this, the paper presents the results of a survey addressed to professionals with practical experience in the development of facade systems for office buildings, situated at any stage of the design and construction process.  Hence, architects, facade consultants, system suppliers and facade builders were considered.  The outcome of this study is the definition of the main perceived barriers for facade integration of solar technologies, discussing the results from the survey along with other related experiences found in the literature.

1544,097-213-898-946-327,BIPV Meets Customizable Glass: A Dialogue between Energy Efficiency and Aesthetics,2018,"The realization of Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) facades with black and blue conventional modules has represented a first step of innovation in the process of PV transfer in sustainable buildings. Nowadays, architects are looking for additional BIPV products to design active facades with novel architectural languages. For this reason, BIPV manufacturers started to customize BIPV modules in order to meet architects and clients’ requirements. However, changing traditional front solar glass to obtain coloured PV, can influence the final module power output. Even though there are already investigations about the reduction of PV energy output due to the front glass aesthetical treatments, there are not yet clear correlations between alternative design options (glass treatments and colours) and their operative conditions as facade elements. This paper is firstly aimed at providing a systematic investigation about novel mono-chromatic BIPV products in order to identify the influence of some main design options on the electro-thermal performances of modules. Specifically, this analysis is performed by evaluating, in collaboration with a Swiss industrial partner, a range of customized mono-chromatic BIPV prototypes by means of indoor measurements and outdoor tests. Furthermore, these results have been used to preliminarily assess the electro-thermal behaviour of multi-chromatic BIPV configurations both at STC and outdoor conditions. As a result, it arises that the operative condition should be carefully considered to qualify the behaviour of multi-chromatic BIPV modules with novel aesthetical designs in order to provide reliable data about the real electro-thermal behaviour.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architectural engineering; Efficient energy use; Facade; Power output; Computer science; Process (engineering); Photovoltaics,http://repository.supsi.ch/10274/,conference article,,no
1545,097-462-045-973-232,Outdoor performance quantification and understanding of various PV technologies using the IEC 61853 matrix,2019,"The principle PV module product rating instrument is the DC power at Standard Test Conditions (STC). For a full year energy prediction, additional performance parameters (e.g. NOCT) have been introduced but have left room for improvement. The newly IEC 61853 norm defines a Pmpp-matrix with 7 settings of GPOA and 4 settings of Tmod, which enables an accurate yield calculation for a specific climate. In our contribution, this GPOA-Tmod-matrix is used for understanding and comparing various PV technologies. In total five visualization and statistical tools have been demonstrated. i) The Pmpp-matrix in colorplot can reveal potential performance issues during specific moments of the year. ii) The significance of each bin to the full year yield is visualized with colormaps of the number of datapoints, irradiation and specific yield. iii) Adding statistics per bin enables cleaning the measurement data from outliers that are common in 24/7 outdoor field data (like shading, power cuts, etc..). iv) Increasing the bin sizing of both the GPOA- and the Tmod-axis improves the visibility of small performance trends. v) Plotting other module parameters (like VOC, Vmpp, ISC, Impp, FF, AOI, IAM) in the same matrix representation is of great help to give a physical explanation to the observed performance phenomena. Finally, the PR-matrix is presented with an additional filter showing only bins that contribute more than a threshold value (e.g. 0.5%) to the total yield. All these visualizations and tooling was applied on the BIPV round-robin module of Task15E. The PR-matrix shows a remarkable (too) low PR for the lowest row of irradiance bins with GPOA=100 W/m2. With the aid of the AOI-matrix this has been attributed to shallow angles of sunlight that are most prominent in these bins. More use cases are presented in which various PV-technologies have been compared side by side. A c-Si and a CIGS-module in a BIPV-facade in the Netherlands have about the same full year DC PR. However, the PR-matrix, showed two distinct effects. On another rack mount setup, the comparison of the PR-matrix of an in-house developed IBC (mini-) module and an n-PERT module also showed very distinct effects in the PR-matrix, whereas the full-year-round PR of both technologies are very competitive and hides all the interesting phenomena.",Matrix representation; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Bin; Efficient energy use; Sizing; Visualization; Computer science; Simulation; Threshold limit value; Outlier,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atudelft.nl%3Auuid%3A07d2af0e-f2b0-46ff-9202-fd64bf746140,journal article,,no

In this context, Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, using innovative PV products as new construction material for facades and roofs, can potentially provide a crucial response for achieving long-term carbon targets. This paper presents an integrated architectural design process for addressing renovation projects. Presented through a comparison of two case studies on archetypal residential buildings from the 1900s and 1970s in Neuchâtel (Switzerland), this approach includes the design of different renovation scenarios integrating passive, active and BIPV strategies. An optimization of the potential BIPV (or active) surfaces based on the annual irradiation threshold is conducted to maximize self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS). The scenarios, before and after this optimization-based refinement, are evaluated in terms of Life-Cycle Assessment and Cost. Results demonstrate the importance of the optimization to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the strategy and increase the independence from energy suppliers.

1555,103-535-449-735-53X,BIM - A Driver for Cost Reduction within the BIPV Industry,2020,"Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology has the potential to significantly contribute to the achievement of the demanding energy efficiency targets set by the EU. However, its market uptake has been hindered in the past years by the difficulties of the industry in providing holistic solutions complying with key demands from decision makers and end-users. This market deployment depends critically on the achievement of ambitious targets in terms of significant cost reduction, flexibility of design, high performance, reliability in the long-term, aesthetics, standardization, and compliance with legal regulations.; Within this context, BIPV stakeholders currently dealing with design, manufacturing and installation, invest significant amount of resources and time (with an impact on the final cost) to translate potential clients’ requests and wishes into a BIPV project proposal with a technical layout, economic offer and feasibility analysis for energy production and installation (efficiency-performance, cost, building skin integration, compliance with regulations, etc.). An integrated and collaborative digital process where information is defined, stored and shared between stakeholders through a digital model and an integrated platform, would reduce efforts, time, repetitive work, risk of mistakes, information losses, etc., transforming an almost “manual” and fragmented work into an interoperable workflow along the value chain. Overcoming these challenges to support cost reduction of BIPV can be achieved by the implementation of BIM (Building information modelling/management) from the construction sector into the BIPV value-chain, in order to introduce a digital and integrated process, supported by methodologies and platforms, ensuring clear structures, efficient processes, less time, lower costs and higher quality across the entire lifecycle.; In this purpose, the European H2020 project BIPVBOOST (www.bipvboost.eu), identified the need for a transfer of a BIM-based digital approach from the construction sector to the whole BIPV process, thus achieving a substantial reduction of the cost along the value chain (from design to installation).; The overall ambition of this study is to highlight BIM activities developed within BIPVBOOST, providing clear definition of the reference BIPV process, including its information categories and KPIs for cost-reduction and developing, from the early design phase, the use of BIM-based software tools for the simulation of PV together with the building energy performance.",Value chain; Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Risk analysis (engineering); Performance indicator; Workflow; Cost reduction; Flexibility (engineering); Computer science; Building information modeling,https://www.eupvsec-proceedings.com/proceedings?paper=49508,journal article,,no

In this context, Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems can potentially provide a crucial response for achieving long-term carbon targets. Functioning both as envelope material and on-site electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Focusing on the architectural design, this paper presents the results of a multi-criteria evaluation in terms of Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Cost (LCC) of different renovation and energy-use scenarios. The goal is to identify which strategies can allow to achieve the ambitious targets for the 2050 horizon by integrating into the design process: 1) Passive strategies, to improve the envelope through low-embodied energy materials and construction systems; 2) BIPV strategies, using innovative photovoltaic products as a new material for facades and roofs; and 3) Active strategies, adapting HVAC systems to improve the efficiency of the BIPV installation and reducing the dependence on the feed-in-tariffs to ensure the profitability of investments.

This is due to the 8th Malaysia Plan (2001-2005) when Government introduced Malaysia Building Integrated Photovoltaic Technology Application (MBIPV) plan to encourage the application of renewable energy source in Malaysia. One of the alternatives that have been done by the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water (KeTTHA) was installing PV panels in government buildings in Putrajaya. Mostly, the installed PV panels only cover up to 30% of the energy demand in one level of a building. However, after operating for some years, the performance of the PV panels was degrading. Since the maintenance cost for PV system is quite high, and due to the factor of lack of knowledge on how to maintain the system, the installed PV systems are mostly abandoned now. The project was discontinued after the warranty period and the contract with the contractor end. Therefore, the aim of this study is to re-improvise the abandoned PV system in one of them which is Building of Section of Legal Affairs (BHEUU). Through this study, three new models of the BIPV system were proposed, namely Model 1 (4IWOB), Model 2 (4IWB), Model 3 (1IWOB), and Model 4 (1IWB). In this study, the technical and economic assessment has been performed. From the findings, results show that Model 3 (1IWOB) provides the best choice to replace the existing BIPV system where this model only use 1 unit of inverter and no battery storage is used.

The methodology was applied to Canadian data on ground floor surface areas to evaluate the electricity that can be produced by grid-connected photovoltaic systems integrated into the rooftops and facades of buildings. The electricity production estimates obtained are compared to the corresponding electricity consumption figures, for each building stock/geographical region under consideration. We also evaluate the associated greenhouse gas emissions that would be avoided if photovoltaic systems were used instead of each province’s mix of electricity generation sources (thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, etc.). Our results illustrate a large, untapped potential for BIPV in Canada. For instance, about 46% of Canada’s residential electricity needs could be supplied by BIPV systems. For the combined residential and commercial/institutional Canadian building stock, about 29% of the 246 TWh consumed annually could be supplied by PV, and an associated 23 Megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions could be avoided.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Electricity; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Greenhouse gas; Photovoltaics; Electricity retailing; Environmental planning; Hydroelectricity,https://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/canmetenergy/files/pubs/2006-047_OP-J_411-SOLRES_BIPV_new.pdf,conference article,,no

Although the BIPV technology has been in the public domain for the last three decades, its adoption has been hindered. Existing literature asserts that proper information and education at the proposal or early design stage is an important way of addressing adoption barriers. However, there is a lack of BIPV communication approaches for research, and market proposals that focus on clear information about its benefits. This has limited the adoption of BIPV.. Based on this, the present study aims to develop a conceptual framework for an educative-communication approach for presenting BIPV proposals to encourage its adoption. This is aimed at developing holistic research and market proposals which justify scholarly investigation and financial investment. Using a multiple case study investigation and Design Research Methodology (DRM) principles, the study developed an approach which combines core communication requirements, the pillars of sustainability and a hierarchical description of BIPV alongside its unique advantages. A two-step evaluation strategy involving an online pilot survey and a literature-based checklist, was used to validate the effectiveness of the developed approach. Our results show that understanding environmental and economic benefits was found to be significantly important to people who are likely adopters of BIPV ( p < 0.05), making these benefits crucial drivers of adoption. Statistical significance was also found between those who do not know the benefits of using solar energy for electricity, and interest in knowing these benefits ( p < 0.05). We thus conclude that proper communication of these benefits can safely be advanced as important facilitators of BIPV adoption. In general, this study elaborates the need and strategies for appropriate dissemination of innovative ideas to encourage and promote adoption of technological advancement for a sustainable global future.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Evaluation strategy; Conceptual framework; Business; Process management; Electricity; Investment (macroeconomics); Public domain; Sustainability; Compound annual growth rate,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10103781,journal article,,no

This may be attributed to several factors such as lack of awareness and knowledge among architects, lack of tools supporting the design process, and lack of solar products designed for building integration. In order to address these issues, the IEA SHC Task 41 ""Solar Energy and Architecture"" was carried out during 2009 to 2012. The main aim was to promote the use of solar energy systems within high quality architecture. The main expected outcome is an increased use of solar energy in buildings, reducing the non-renewable energy use and GHG emissions. Fourteen countries participated. The work was organized in three subtasks: A) integration criteria and guidelines, B) tools and methods for architects, and C) case studies and communication guidelines. This article presents an overview of the Task's activities and results. The results include an inventory of computer tools, a literature review, a survey on solar systems perception and use by architects, a survey on needs regarding tools for solar design, recommendations for computer tool developers and different guidelines for solar product developers and architects. Finally an extensive collection of more than 250 case studies with integration of solar systems was evaluated and resulting in the online publication of around 65 selected cases demonstrating inspiring solar architecture. The results of Task 41 are also currently being disseminated through seminars and workshops for building professionals. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With a net floor area (NFA) of 22.650 m 2, it is to date one of the largest designed and built plus-energy building in Europe. The boundaries considered in the annual energy balance are limited to the loads of the heating, ventilation and cooling systems (HVAC), of the domestic hot water (DHW) and of the lighting; user-dependent energy demands are not considered. To achieve a positive primary energy balance, the building envelope is highly insulated, the energy supply is based on a low-exergy concept and onsite energy is generated by a large Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) plant combined with photovoltaic-thermal combined collectors (PVT). The central component of the heat generation is a ground-water coupled heat pump system supplying thermal activated concrete slabs, heating ceilings and air handling units (AHUs). Cooling is ensured over the geothermal well. To the date of this publication, the building has been intensively monitored for one-and-a-half year. Here, we present the energy concept as well as the results of the first monitoring period and provide an assessment of the energy balance in comparison to the plus-energy objective as well as an initial analysis of the load curves and of the heating and cooling systems.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Primary energy; HVAC; Civil engineering; Building envelope; Energy supply; Heat pump; Energy balance; Heat generation; Environmental science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/352/1/012003,journal article,,no

Into the design process of Advanced Active Facades (AAF),2017,"Building Integrated Photovoltaics’ (BIPV) performance is improving rapidly. However, their potential is diminished because of several barriers. Due to its limited expressive quality, architects tend to avoid integrating BIPV in building design, more particularly, in facades. In order to bridge the gap between technology and design, this research aims at developing design strategies to integrate BIPV’s expressive issues into today’s facade construction, focusing on new collective residential dwellings. In this context, the poster presents the Advanced Active Facade (AAF) concept, which results from the analysis of facade’s evolution, in terms of requirements and constructive solutions. The AAF benefits from passive low carbon design strategies and active BIPV technology. This system permits to meet low energy consumption targets and, by integrating BIPV expressive issues, it enables architects to play with a range of expressive parameters such as transparency, color and modulation.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Bridge (nautical); Building design; Quality (business); Context (language use); Facade; Engineering design process; Transparency (graphic),https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/227957,conference article,,no

AlN and TiN are among suitable and cost-effective optical materials to be used as thin multilayer films, owing to the significant difference in their refractive index. To fabricate the structure, we used radio frequency magnetron deposition method to achieve the target thickness uniformly. A simple, fast, and cheap fabrication method is achieved by depositing the multilayer films in a single sputtering chamber. It is demonstrated that a multilayer stack that allows light to be transmitted from a low refractive index layer to a high refractive index layer or vice-versa can effectively create various distinct color reflections for different film thicknesses and multilayer structures. It is investigated from simulation based on wave optics that TiN/AlN multilayer offers better color design freedom and a cheaper fabrication process as compared to AlN/TiN multilayer films. Blue, green, and yellow color glasses with optical transmittance of more than 80% was achieved by indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass/TiN/AlN multilayer films.

An interesting BIPV application is in high-rise office buildings as facade elements, enabling the exploitation of large surface areas for energy generation in the built environment. This paper investigates the behavior of BIPV modules when integrated in high-rise buildings. The focus is on thermal aspects, including the annual temperature distribution and the equivalent temperature, the latter representing the cumulative effects of thermal degradation. The openIDEAS environment and a validated BIPV model are used to simulate the building thermal conditions and to obtain the BIPV (cell) temperature and power output. Five different locations with diverse climatic conditions are considered: Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), Seville (Spain), Naples (FL, USA), Cape Town (South Africa), and Munich (Germany). The results have shown that both temperature distribution and equivalent temperature vary significantly among the locations, with Riyadh and Seville having the highest temperature while Munich and Cape Town the lowest. Furthermore, little difference was observed between equator-oriented and west/east orientations of the BIPV modules for all locations. Finally, wind effects seem to have an important impact on both equivalent temperature as well as energy yield.

As such, the design of a novel building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) solar collector is theoretically analysed through the use of a modified Hottel-Whillier model.

However, the output power of every photovoltaic DC building module in the DC-module-based BIPV system is random and varies with illumination, temperature, et al. Furthermore, the parallel of many photovoltaic DC building modules ulteriorly increase the complexity of energy flow in the system. Consequently the coordinate control between the photovoltaic DC building modules and the centralized inverter is necessary to achieve energy balance and stability. Firstly the coordinate control hypostasis of the DC-module-based BIPV system was analyzed, and a coordinate control strategy based on constant of the DC bus voltage was proposed. Then the accurate dynamic model was built to analyze and design the coordinate controller, and a design method was presented.

To reduce the energy consumed by indoor lighting, we propose a sensor-less light-emitting diode (LED) dimming system using daylight harvesting. In this study, we used light simulation software to quantify and visualize daylight, and analyzed the correlation between photovoltaic (PV) power generation and indoor illumination in an office with an integrated PV system. In addition, we calculated the distribution of daylight illumination into the office and dimming ratios for the individual control of LED lights. Also, we were able directly to use the electric power generated by PV system. As a result, power consumption for electric lighting was reduced by 40 - 70% depending on the season and the weather conditions. Thus, the dimming system proposed in this study can be used to control electric lighting to reduce energy use cost-effectively and simply.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24921990,journal article,,no

Business tycoons are introducing electric vehicles which fascinates people. However, there is yet a stabilized solution to be found for charging electric vehicles with green energy on the basis of large scale implementations. In the Netherlands, there are more bikes than the total population and with the number of e-bikes increasing every year it would be brilliant to charge the e-bikes with decentralized renewable energy than with the conventional way of purchasing energy from the grid. In this thesis such a charging facility called the Solar Mobility Hub is studied thoroughly and validated for performance. By validation, it means the system was tested for the number of e-bikes it can charge throughout the year as an autonomous system without loss of load. Instead of going into complete modelling a different approach was pursued. E-bike ride programs were conducted for a few months with the help of volunteers from which technical data necessary to develop exclusive full year load profiles were obtained. Thereby, generating two kind of load profiles - work to home (commute mode) and bike sharing (sharing mode). It was found that the solar mobility hub was capable of charging 19 e-bikes as a 100 % reliable autonomous charging infrastructure for commute mode and 15 e-bikes for sharing mode. Furthermore, advanced simulations were performed with system modifications like change of PV array tilt and increased battery bank. Finally, a performance analysis on the system was conducted and the reasons for the variation in performance were analysed.

1575,117-287-744-360-45X,"Accelerated climate ageing of building materials, components and structures in the laboratory",2012,"Building materials, components and structures have to fulfil many functional demands during the lifetime of a building. Therefore, it is important to require satisfactory durability of these materials, components and structures. In fact, one single material failure may jeopardize whole components as well as structures. Unfortunately, experience shows that building products too often do not satisfy the various requirements after a relatively short period of use, i.e. the expected service life is considerably shorter than foreseen. This results in increased and large costs due to increased maintenance, extensive replacements of the specific building products and any possible consequential building damages. In addition, health hazards with respect to both risk and consequence may also become an issue. To avoid this, the solution is to apply building products which have properly documented adequate and satisfactory long-term durability. That is, building products which have been subjected to long-term natural outdoor climate exposure or appropriate accelerated climate ageing in the laboratory. This study examines the main climate exposures and how these may be reproduced in the laboratory in various ways. Thus, crucial properties of building products and their durability towards climate strains may be investigated within a relatively short time frame compared with natural outdoor climate ageing. Examples of miscellaneous climate ageing laboratory apparatuses, ageing methods and building product properties to be tested before, during and after ageing are given. A calculation method for estimating acceleration factors is also discussed. Various ageing examples are shown and discussed. A special note is made towards accelerated climate ageing of new and advanced materials being developed. Hence, this study addresses durability and the versatile and powerful application of accelerated climate ageing which is an all too overlooked field within materials science and engineering.",Durability; Risk analysis (engineering); Materials science; Building product; Time frame; Advanced materials; Acceleration factor; Ageing; Forensic engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-012-6349-7,journal article,SINTEF,no

The roof being a climate screen, shields inner structures from various precipitations preventing most of the water from intruding. Although WDR exposure tests are quite common, there is a lack of studies that explore a quantification of water intrusion during such an experiment. Novel technologies such as e.g. building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems have been steadily more used as the building envelope components, and majority of BIPV systems are designed for roof integration. Such systems are mainly viewed as electricity generators, consequently, the power output and parameters that affect them are usually in focus when these systems are evaluated, whereas little information is available on the weather protection performance of BIPV systems. To address this gap, a series of experiments were conducted to improve the testing methodology of WDR exposure for BIPV systems where quantification of water intrusion was implemented. As a result, a novel framework is presented, which includes a step-by-step test methodology and a detailed description of the construction of a water collection system. Selected BIPV system for roof integration was tested according to the methodology and collected water amounts were provided.

This renew has an ecological, social and economic importance. These three aspects reflect my sustainable approach. On the other hand, the establishment of a new use strategy for the Q-Port building in form of a Hotel and Congress Centre plays a key role. The Q-Port building is a bad example of urban planning when an important aspect of life – work – leads to mono-functional urban sectors. Instead of thinking in certain functional categories, I want to create spaces in the urban context in which we simply enjoy living – spaces with leeway for individuality – regardless of how large the building is. KEY Feature - “Grune Lunge” Key feature of my design is the “Grune Lunge”, an open public way and an energy generating technology as design element of the facade to unite the urban concept and the energy concept within the facade design. The redesign of the Q-Port building is linked to the historic urban planning strategy to be a green recreational area. Urban porosity is the key intention of the new hybrid Q-Port building with the aim of pedestrian oriented urban places. The transformed Q-Port building becomes localized a `social condenser´ for new communities: The “Grune Lunge”, an open public space spirals upwards from the street and guides the people through the building. ReDesign The redesign is not only use related but also energy efficient with the design of an energy generating facade, which makes the building to an energy production. In the focus there is an active intelligent facade, the “Grune Lunge”, in relation to the climate of a building and the possibility for the urban context: The facade is my fascination because it shows most dominant the architectural value of a building. It is the visible statement to the world and it gives a face to the building. Facades connect the inside space and the outside city rooms and have a high potential as multifunctional construction elements. The new task of the facade in my design is, that the “Grune Lunge”, which is an open public way, is linked to the energy concept of the whole building and is main part of the ventilation concept. The “Grune Lunge” is an open public way, which spirals upwards, and guaranties natural ventilation in the rooms. In the summer time it transports cold air from the north side of the building into the south part. The night cooling out of the building in the summer is done by the “Grune Lunge”. In the winter time the air is transported from the south side of the building and is preheated in the buffer zone of the “Grune Lunge” and flows over an air guide system in the suspended floors into the rooms. Moreover, the “Grune Lunge” acts as an interspace and a connection point for the public and private activities within the building. Benchmark The perforated glass in the building envelope is only broken by the transparent envelope of the “Grune Lunge”. The “Grune Lunge” in the building`s envelope can be seen from the highway or the streets and by this people get interested in the new use strategy of the Q Port building. The new Q Port building should become a highlight building in the Brettenzone like a Benchmark for the city part Brettenzone. Therefore the installation of a media facade which offers surface for commercial activities is done in addition to the BIPV modules at the closed facade parts. This is the next step into a more sustainable future: The energy concept for the Q-Port building is able to generate energy within the facade and so unifies the energy demands of the future.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Building envelope; Natural ventilation; Facade; Redevelopment; Public space; Urban planning; Facade engineering,http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:a18e0e0d-3a7e-44dd-8723-5c16a2ecffa2,journal article,,no
1586,124-097-166-564-608,EnergyPlus Analysis Capabilities for Use in California Building Energy Efficiency Standards Development and Compliance Calculations,2008,"California has been using DOE-2 as the main building energy analysis tool in the development of building energy efficiency standards (Title 24) and the code compliance calculations. However, DOE-2.1E is a mature program that is no longer supported by LBNL on contract to the USDOE, or by any other public or private entity. With no more significant updates in the modeling capabilities of DOE-2.1E during recent years, DOE-2.1E lacks the ability to model, with the necessary accuracy, a number of building technologies that have the potential to reduce significantly the energy consumption of buildings in California. DOE-2's legacy software code makes it difficult and time consuming to add new or enhance existing modeling features in DOE-2. Therefore the USDOE proposed to develop a new tool, EnergyPlus, which is intended to replace DOE-2 as the next generation building simulation tool. EnergyPlus inherited most of the useful features from DOE-2 and BLAST, and more significantly added new modeling capabilities far beyond DOE-2, BLAST, and other simulations tools currently available. With California's net zero energy goals for new residential buildings in 2020 and for new commercial buildings in 2030, California needs to evaluate and promote currently available best practice and emerging technologies to significantly reduce energy use of buildings for space cooling and heating, ventilating, refrigerating, lighting, and water heating. The California Energy Commission (CEC) needs to adopt a new building energy simulation program for developing and maintaining future versions of Title 24. Therefore, EnergyPlus became a good candidate to CEC for its use in developing and complying with future Title 24 upgrades. In 2004, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company contracted with Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC), Taylor Engineering, and GARD Analytics to evaluate EnergyPlus in its ability to model those energy efficiency measures specified in both the residential and nonresidential Alternative Calculation Method (ACM) of the Title-24 Standards. The AEC team identified gaps between EnergyPlus modeling capabilities and the requirements of Title 24 and ACMs. AEC's evaluation was based on the 2005 version of Title 24 and ACMs and the version 1.2.1 of EnergyPlus released on October 1, 2004. AEC's evaluation is useful for understanding the functionality and technical merits of EnergyPlus for implementing the performance-based compliance methods described in the ACMs. However, it did not study the performance of EnergyPlus in actually making building energy simulations for both the standard and proposed building designs, as is required for any software program to be certified by the CEC for use in doing Title-24 compliance calculations. In 2005, CEC funded LBNL to evaluate the use of EnergyPlus for compliance calculations by comparing the ACM accuracy test runs between DOE-2.1E and EnergyPlus. LBNL team identified key technical issues that must be addressed before EnergyPlus can be considered by the CEC for use in developing future Nonresidential Title-24 Standards or as an ACM tool. With Title 24 being updated to the 2008 version (which adds new requirements to the standards and ACMs), and EnergyPlus having been through several update cycles from version 1.2.1 to 2.1, it becomes crucial to review and update the previously identified gaps of EnergyPlus for use in Title 24, and more importantly to close the gaps which would help pave the way for EnergyPlus to be adopted as a Title 24 compliance ACM. With this as the key driving force, CEC funded LBNL in 2008 through this PIER (Public Interest Energy Research) project with the overall technical goal to expand development of EnergyPlus to provide for its use in Title-24 standard compliance and by CEC staff.",Legacy system; Zero-energy building; Building design; Systems engineering; Emerging technologies; Efficient energy use; Building energy simulation; Energy consumption; Computer science; Certification,http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/944980,journal article,,no

Main energy demands originate from domestic electricity consumption of appliances and an electricity driven heat pump for space heating and domestic hot water production, whereas local energy supply is provided by building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. Large simultaneity of net power supply at building level within a residential district results in strong underestimation of grid over-voltages for hourly irradiance data. The use of minutely meteorological data is critical for assessment of power losses due to inverter switch-offs caused by grid voltage increases. On the demand side, the main deviation is found in a possible correlation of heat pump power demands for SH or DHW but not in the stochastic nature of domestic electricity consumption.

Functioning both as envelope material and electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions while providing savings in materials and electricity costs. These are precisely the objectives of most European energy directives, from zero- to positive-energy buildings. In Switzerland for instance, one way to achieve the objectives of the “Energy strategy 2050” is to install PV systems to cover 1/3 of the annual electricity demand. However, despite continuous technological and economic progress, the significant assets of BIPV remain broadly undervalued in the current practice. Various obstacles (technology choice, small volumes, lack of information and good examples, etc.) tend to increase the costs and reduce the acceptance of BIPV solutions. The present paper is an integral part of an interdisciplinary research project. Focusing on the architectural design issues, it presents the first results of a representative case study carried out in the city of Neuchâtel (Switzerland). The approach involves four main phases (Fig.1): (i) archetypes identification, (ii) building detailed analysis, (iii) development of architectural renewal design scenarios, and (iv) multi-criteria assessment of each scenario (energy consumption, electricity production, cost-effectiveness, and Life-Cycle Analysis).

Moreover, the solar energy as the most abundant energy resource among renewable energies plays a crucial role to provide the energy demand. The BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics) systems can be considered to supply the required energy demand from renewable sources. The essential advantage of BIPV systems is that they can be utilized as building component such as roof, window, shading systems and building facade and they can generate electricity simultaneously. Even though the photovoltaic technologies have been improved within past few years, however the utilization of the BIPV systems will be considered expensive. For this reason, the payback period calculation is considered a vital parameter in evaluating the BIPV systems. In this study, the overall energy consumption for producing one m2 of a mono-crystalline photovoltaic module is calculated 1334 kWh. Additionally, the photovoltaic module data for three companies were investigated and the annual energy productions for one m2 of each company’s product were obtained. The results showed that the average energy payback time for 270 and 280 watt modules are 5.565 and 5.254 respectively. Moreover, the energy payback time for 290, 325 and 340 watt modules were calculated 4.903, 5.437 and 4.965 respectively.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Payback period; Renewable energy; Process engineering; Facade; Energy consumption; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://www.jree.ir/article_100263.html,journal article,,no

A simulation model is developed to quantify the benefits and drawbacks of different PV system architectures. The model includes a shading evaluation of the installation with means of 3D modeling, irradiance calculations, PV cell modelling and finally an empirical power conversion model. The energy yield of three leading architectures is confirmed (string inverter, power optimizer, micro inverter) for clear and partial shading conditions by means of an outdoor field test.

In particular, owing to the rapid growth of information and communication technology, the requirement for appropriate operation and control of energy systems has become an important issue. To meet these requirements, a computational model is essential; however, some unmeasurable parameters can result in inaccurate results. This work proposes a calibration method for unknown parameters of a well-known BIPV model based on in situ test data measured over eight days; this parameter calibration was conducted via an optimization algorithm. The unknown parameters were set such that the results obtained from the BIPV simulation model are similar to the in situ measurement data. Results of the calibrated model indicated a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.39 °C and 0.26 kW in the BIPV cell temperature and total power production, respectively, whereas the noncalibrated model, which used typical default values for unknown parameters, showed an RMSE of 6.92 °C and 0.44 kW for the same outputs.

The avoided use of comparably priced alternatives such as polished stone in commercial facades enables PV to be applied often at no additional cost. The use of semi-transparent PV modules within commercial atria represents an interesting application in this respect. However, compared to standard double glazing an element incorporating mono-crystalline PV cells in a glass-glass construction comes at a cost premium. To justify such an application there must be significant added value in the PV solution. This paper critically appraises a semi-transparent PV atrium which has been used to link two buildings at Southampton University. The PV atrium encloses the main campus reception desk and performs multiple functions, which have direct and indirect benefits for the building users and the wider University: electricity generation, solar protection, environmental and technology statements for the building and the University, enhanced comfort and prestige of the office workspace. A comparison of alternative shading solutions for the atrium combined with evaluation of user’s perception of the building / atrium and its impact on their personal workspace has been undertaken.

This paper hopes to enable PV deployments in most airports by providing an approach to overcome the three primary challenges identified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): (1) reflectivity and glare; (2) radar interference; and (3) physical penetration of airspace. First, these challenges and precautions that must be adhered to for safe PV projects deployment at airports are reviewed and summarized. Since one of the core concerns for PV and airport symbiosis is solar panel reflectivity, and because this data is largely estimated, a controlled experiment is conducted to determine worst-case values of front panel surface reflectivity and compare them to theoretical calculations. Then a general approach to implement solar PV systems in an airport is outlined and this approach is applied to a case study airport. The available land was found to be over 570 acres, which would generate more than 39,000% of the actual annual power demand of the existing airport.

The differences in the performance loss rates (PLRs) between module types and mounting configurations were determined by using the year-overyear methodology. The glass/backsheet module was markedly affected by the higher operating temperature: PLR changed from 0.01%/yr for ventilated to -0.42%/yr for insulated. However, the glass/glass module showed an opposite and unexpected trend: PLR changed from -0.10%/yr for ventilated to 0.26%/yr for insulated. Analysis of the IV curve parameters revealed that the decreased performance of the insulated glass/backsheet module was chiefly due to the loss in the fill factor with increased resistance; however, the gain in the short-circuit current (I sc ) was the main driver for the increased performance of the insulated glass/glass module. Real-world temperature coefficients were further examined and they were mostly found to be in line with the values measured indoors. Lower power-temperature and higher current-temperature dependence of the insulated glass/glass module, compared to the ventilated construction, supported the observed performance and current behavior of this module.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Operating temperature; Composite material; Materials science; Thermal; Crystalline silicon; Fill factor; Photovoltaic system; Current–voltage characteristic,http://repository.supsi.ch/12157/,journal article,,no
1620,145-657-570-022-899,Developing a BIPVT: Building Integrated PV-Thermal System,2018,"Photovoltaic Technologies in recent years have gained immense attention owing to reduced costs and increasing efficiencies. While decades of research in Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) technologies, producing thermal and electrical energy simultaneously have brought these costs further down, improving a system’s overall performance. PVT collectors consist of PV modules with a thermal absorber bonded/attached underneath them. Excessive solar radiation that is not converted into electricity by the panels is released as heat, causing their temperatures to rise. Rising PV panel temperatures have an adverse effect on their efficiency, particularly for building integrated photovoltaics, that generally lack sufficient ventilation for this heat release. Thermal absorbers for PVT systems, are designed specifically for absorbing the excess heat generated by PV modules. In practise, helping the panels perform better by effectively removing the heat present behind them, with the help of a heat transfer fluid. This project has been a collaborative effort between the TU Delft, and Exasun BV, a solar panel manufacturer located in the Netherlands. At Exasun, the project has also benefited by being a part of a larger consortium project, the PVT inSHaPe, currently underway at the Solar Energy Application Centre (SEAC), in Eindhoven. PVT inSHaPe aims to realise zero energy buildings by integrating PVT systems with heat pumps alongside effective thermal storage. As a manufacturer, Exasun BV specialises in state of the art building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV). BIPV systems aim to integrate photovoltaic technologies seamlessly into building facades. In doing so, they forego essential thermal ventilation required for maintaining lower panel temperatures. Thus, a novel BIPVT design was developed in-house at Exasun, for extracting the excess heat of panels, and utilising it to match the domestic hot water and space heating demand for Dutch households. A simple thermal model for concentrating PV-Thermal collectors, currently under development at the TU Delft was validated alongside widely used steady-state and quasi-dynamic thermal models. Individually calculated thermal efficiencies from the models were juxtaposed, with the simple thermal model recording an error of 1.65% against the steady-state model, and an error of 9.21 % against the quasi-dynamic model. Once validated, the model was used further for system characterisation and performance evaluations of the design. Various technology concepts have been tested extensively. However, further feasibility, reliability and optimisation studies need to be performed, in order to test the novel, cost-effective, and relatively maintenance free design in mind. The performance of PVT systems rely on high irradiance levels from the sun, and module temperatures. As space heating demands are higher during winter months, even after heat pump integration, the system is not effective enough to match the entirety of the load demand, and must be coupled with an auxiliary (electrical) heater, that can be powered by the PV system. Presumptive performance analysis carried out for a simulated household, revealed an average thermal efficiency of 10 % for the design, while recording a combined efficiency of 36 %. The stand-alone system was able to match over 55 % of the domestic hot water demand. When combined with a heat pump, the system is able to meet roughly 80 % of the hot water demand, while it is able to match almost 40 % of the complete thermal demand for a household.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal energy storage; Zero-energy building; Electricity; Process engineering; Heat pump; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Thermal efficiency; Solar energy,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A18e9d987-9343-458c-a007-36b587ae3d42,journal article,,no
1621,145-839-959-509-440,BIPV with On-Grid Tariff Policy in China,2014,"Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is an important direction of the green building. BIPV has developed rapidly in many developed countries and effectively saved resources. It owes to the government's effective promotion policy. The implementation of the on-grid tariff policy is a new stage of BIPV development. BIPV on-grid tariff pricing is a key point of BIPV promotion. Whether on-grid tariff is reasonable and applicable or not will directly affect the implementation effect of BIPV on-grid tariff policy. The current international common standard cost method is used to calculate on-grid tariff. Many countries implement unified on-grid tariff standard in their country, and often ignores the differences between different projects and areas. Based on the average on-grid tariff with standard cost method ,combined with the influence factors of BIPV on-grid tariff this paper build a corresponding on-grid tariff adjustment coefficient system with the current study method.

1622,146-740-542-865-200,A Comparative Study for a Building Integrated Semitransparent PhotovoltaicThermal (BISPVT) System Integrated to Roof with and without Duct,2020,"In this paper, a study has been carried out to evaluate annual energy and exergy of a building integrated semitransparent photovoltaic thermal (BISPVT) system integrated to the roof of a building with and without duct. Comparisons of annual energy and exergy have been done by considering six different photovoltaic (PV) modules installed on the roof for cold climatic city of Srinagar, India. It is observed that the annual overall thermal energy is maximum for heterojunction with thin layer (HIT) and minimum for amorphous silicon (a-Si) for both with and without duct cases. It is also found that the annual overall exergy in HIT is 643 kWh and 610 kWh for both with and without duct cases, respectively. A lot of experimental and theoretical studies have been done on building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) system and it is found that integration of PV modules on the roof of a building produces a large amount of electrical energy as compared to integration of PV module on the facade. Thus BIPVT systems on roof save annual building electrical energy. Li et al. found the annual building electricity saving of 1203 MWh by using semitransparent PV module. Sadineni et al. saved 3.19 kWp of annual electrical energy by installing a system on the south facing roof of home in Las Vegas. System performance and system efficiency for a PV module installed on the roof and facade for a Samsung Institute of Engineering and Construction Technology (SIECT), Gihung, were evaluated by Yoo et al. They observed that the BIPV system on the building provides about 10% of the required electricity for a typical day. Song et al suggested that the PV modules installed at 30 °C performed better than vertical PV module in terms of annual power output. Agrawal and Tiwari developed analytical expression for room air temperature for an opaque-type BIPVT system mounted on the rooftop of a building. They concluded that for a constant mass flow rate of air, room temperature is higher in series combination than any other type of combination of BIPVT system. In all researches, mono crystalline, poly crystalline silicon (mor p-Si), and amorphous silicon (a-Si) modules have been considered. But in this paper alternative PV technologies like cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and a heterojunction comprised of a thin a-Si PV cell on top of a c-Si cell (HIT-hetrojunction with intrinsic thin layer) have also been considered for the analysis. In this paper, a comparative study has been carried out to evaluate annual energy and exergy of a building integrated semitransparent photovoltaic thermal (BISPVT) system integrated to the roof of a building with and without duct, for different types of PV modules.

1623,147-006-445-562-558,Performance assessment and optimization of a HVAC system integrating a BIPV/T system: Model development and application to the Deep Performance Dwelling of TeamMTL for the Solar Decathlon China 2018,2018,"European policy makers have established a set of 20-20-20 targets for the year 2020 in the energy sector, goals based on security of supply, competitive markets and sustainability. The 3 key objectives include a 20% reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and CO2 compared to 1990 levels (and up to 80% by 2050), a 20% improvement in energy efficiency and a 20% share of basis energy consumption from renewable sources. On its own, the building sector is responsible for 1/3 of the world’s energy consumption, of which 60% is due to heating and cooling. In the European Union, this proportion achieves 40% of the total energy consumption, of which heating, cooling and domestic hot water account for around 70%. Fossil fuels represent 75% of the primary energy supply for heating and cooling needs whereas renewable energies account for only 18% followed by nuclear energy with 7%. A brief energy context being stated, this work focused on the assessment and the optimization of a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, coupled with a building integrated photovoltaic and thermal (BIPV/T) system and a simple BIPV system. The objective was to reduce the overall energy consumption of a very well insulated dwelling aiming to make it a net zero energy building (NZEB). This HVAC system incorporated a dual-tank water-to-water heat pump (WWHP), used for space heating and cooling, using the BIPV/T system as a heat source thanks to preheated air. The dwelling is a so-called Deep Performance Dwelling (DPD) developed by the Solar Decathlon team from Canada: TeamMTL. This DPD was used as case study all along this Master thesis. On the one hand, this study aimed at the modelling of both integrated PV systems which were developed firstly with the MATLAB software and then with the TRNSYS software. One of the objectives was to highlight the impact of the thermal recovery from the BIPV/T system on its PV modules efficiency compared to the BIPV system. Furthermore, the same initial and boundary conditions were used to ensure a truthfulness on-site energy production from both BIPV/T and BIPV systems as well as for the validation of these systems, later integrated to the complete DPD modelling. On the other hand, sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of various parameters on the NZEB objective and the on-site energy fraction (OEF) covered by the energy produced by the DPD. These parameters included the efficiency of the PV modules, their tilt angle, the materials used for both floors and walls as well as the size and the control strategy used of both electrical and thermal storage. First, even if the comparison of both MATLAB and TRNSYS modellings led to a similar net increase in the BIPV/T average electrical efficiency of + 0.0014 [-] compare to the BIPV one, the TRNSYS one achieved an 11.0% lower yearly electrical generation due to an intrinsic factor used in TRNSYS called Incidence Angle Modifier (IAM). The impact of this factor affected all the more the thermal yield, namely a reduction by 28.6% for the annual thermal production along with a 32.0% lower thermal efficiency of the BIPV/T system compared to the one modelled in MATLAB. However, given that TRNSYS was required to model the transient behaviours of the DPD, not conceivable with MATLAB due to the time constraint of this Master thesis, it was logically concluded to use the TRNSYS modelling of the integrated PV systems. Then, to have a good representativeness of the performances of the DPD, 4 cities with very different climates were chosen. For each location, the DPD was categorized as a nearly zero energy building (nZEB). Then, the simulation results emphasized that an optimal tilt angle adapted to every location, concrete-based floors as well as high efficiency PV modules allowed for reaching the NZEB objective in 3 cities, the 4th one facing low annual irradiation. Moreover, sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to improve the energy performance of the DPD. Based on the interpretation of the results concerning both on-site energy indices and energy outputs, a better configuration than the one of the as-built DPD was suggested for each city. Indeed, the sensitivity analyses indicated that the bigger the electrical storage, the better the electrical OEF index. Then, a 300-litre hot water tank as well as a 150-litre cold water tank led to a better overall OEF index and a lower energy consumption compared to the initial configuration. These results were obtained by applying the initial control strategy relying on price benefits of the grid based on bidirectional power flows between the batteries and the grid. However, a grid-tied configuration with no more batteries-grid connection and not taking anymore advantage of incentive prices of the grid stood out an even better overall electrical OEF index, making a higher use of the on-site power generation. Finally, the proportion between the on-site PV production and the amount of energy supplied by the grid to meet the demand of the DPD were calculated. Besides, the impact of the solar house in terms of CO2 emissions as well as its advantages for the grid were alluded.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Primary energy; Automotive engineering; Zero-energy building; Renewable energy; Efficient energy use; TRNSYS; Energy consumption; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ab1eea519-9aee-40a5-ba1a-e9a5f3367a89,journal article,,no
1624,147-580-375-896-523,Coloured Building Integrated Photovoltaics: Influence on Energy Efficiency,2020,"Abstract Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) has attracted increased commercial interest in recent years due to a growing focus on efficient utilization of land area and local renewable energy generation. Aesthetic aspects must be considered when photovoltaic panels are applied as building elements. Colours can be added by reflecting some of the sunlight that otherwise could have been utilized for electricity generation. Reflectance spectra of commercial solar cell modules have been measured and analysed. Relative efficiency loss caused by the reflected solar radiation energy has been calculated. The calculated losses in efficiency based on measured spectra have been compared to model spectra with colour coordinates corresponding to RAL colours as well as more idealized monochromatic spectra. The analysis shows that the most important colour parameter affecting loss is the lightness. The second most important parameter is the hue of the colour, with green-yellow colours having the lowest loss, and pink colours resulting in the highest loss, when colours with the same lightness are compared. A Colour Performance Index (CPI) given by luminous reflectance divided by relative loss has been proposed as a figure of merit, thus allowing for a useful comparison of colours with different lightness.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optics; Hue; Renewable energy; Lightness; Solar cell; Mathematics; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Radiant energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109623,journal article,SINTEF,no
1625,147-793-296-415-33X,Thermal Response of Building Integrated Photovoltaic Systems: Analysis of Monitoring Data from Installations at Three Sites in Europe,2014,"Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems comprise any system where photovoltaic (PV) components are incorporated into the building envelope, thereby replacing traditional construction elements of roofs or facades for example, and hence ensuring their functions (water tightness, esthetics, mechanical strength etc.). A significant advantage of BIPV compared to non-integrated systems is the lack of the need to allocate neither land nor additional mounting structures and to favor local use of energy (self-consumption solutions at building or district level). As a drawback, the operating temperature of BIPV systems are usually higher compared to free standing PV systems because of limited cooling (1,2). Maintaining or reducing the operating temperature of PV elements is important during the photovoltaic energy conversion process since it influences the efficiency, the decline in performance over time and the lifetime of the PV system. In this paper, we present and analyze experimental results of the monitoring of ten BIPV systems realized within the “Performance BIPV” project (partners CSTB, CEA, CNRS, Transenergie and Cythelia) and by EURAC in three European locations. The aim of our study is to investigate and compare the operative temperature issue in different BIPV applications. Each BIPV system is instrumented to record component temperatures (at the backside of PV modules), electrical production and environmental conditions. The monitored BIPV systems dataset is compared with two ground mounted PV plants located in Bolzano, which are monitored by EURAC since 2010 (3–5). The variation of PV module temperatures rise above ambient temperature is studied as a function of the global irradiation. Based on measured data, an empirical equivalent thermal resistance between PV modules and ambient temperature is considered for various time scales based on a static model. An overview on empirical equivalent thermal resistance values for each analyzed system is provided, resulting in a range from 0.0297 to 0.0397 for most of the BIPV systems and from 0.0249 to 0.0291 for the not-integrated PV systems. As further studies, collaborative projects will be launched between some partners in order to propose solutions to improve the thermal operating conditions of BIPV systems.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Operating temperature; Thermal resistance; Automotive engineering; Building envelope; Range (aeronautics); Solar architecture; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Operative temperature,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01272785,conference article,,no

Even the most ancient settlements, to avoid the definitive neglect, will have to be opened towards a “contemporary” logic of refurbishment including a “right” technological contribution as well as an environmentally aware reflection, aimed to establish a deeper dialog with material, water and energetic-climatic resources. In Italian territories hit by earthquake, this challenge is already today a potential for the life return: BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic), or in general PV integration, is one of the possible ways that needs to be faced without ideological preclusions within an eco-sustainable refurbishment approach. The research path is aimed to research possible criteria, compatible tools and examples for the technological transfer of solar systems in the refurbishment processes of minor historical centres. The photovoltaic ""integration project"" in sensitive areas, differently from ordinary contexts, needs a specific methodological approach linked to the topics of ""controlled transformation"" and ""compatibility of integration"". The typical design complexity in these contexts has so far paid a widespread prohibition with few realized examples, although the research has already showed a possible ""acceptance"" even in areas with high values. The study presented deepens the topic of '""photovoltaic integrability"", as an opportunity for a ""possible"" and ""duty"" innovative refurbishment of the historical minor built. The research specifically identifies, for different scales of intervention, possible integration ways of solar systems in the process of reconstruction in L’Aquila, starting from some methodological criteria previously defined for the architectural language control and for the technological requirements of PV components. The outcome of this research could be the introduction of criteria for PV integration in the reconstruction process. This research, once completed and shared (e.g. through guide-lines, tools, quantitative evaluations…), could be a basic instrument for local authorities and operators, to guide the reconstruction policy of the next years on a path of energetic innovation, at the same time eco-friendly, technologically advanced and in full respect of historical, environmental and landscape values of these places.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Ideology; Human settlement; Architectural engineering; Dialog box; Operations management; Duty; Photovoltaic system; Sustainability,http://repository.supsi.ch/4785/,conference article,,no

The main aim of the green generators or converters of energy is to replace the conventional (fossil) energy sources, hence reducing further accumulation of the green house gasses GHGs. Conventional silicon and III-V semiconductor solar cell based on crystalline bulk, quantum well and quantum dots structure or amorphous and thin film structures provided a feasible solution. However, natural dye sensitized solar cells NDSSC are a promising class of photovoltaic cells with the capability of generating green energy at low production cost since no vacuum systems or expensive equipment are required in their fabrication. Also, natural dyes are abundant, easily extracted and safe materials. In NDSSC, once dye molecules exposed to light they become oxidized and transfer electrons to a nanostructured layer of wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2. The generated electrons are drawn outside the cell through ohmic contact to a load. In this paper we review the structure and operation principles of the dye sensitized solar cell DSSC. We discuss preparation procedures, optical and electrical characterization of the NDSSC using local dyes extracted from Henna (Lawsonia inermis L.), pomegranate, cherries and Bahraini raspberries (Rubus spp.). These natural organic dyes are potential candidates to replace some of the man-made dyes used as sensitizer in many commercialized photoelectrochemical cells. Factors limiting the operation of the DSSC are discussed. NDSSCs are expected to be a favored choice in the building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) due to their robustness, therefore, requiring no special shielding from natural events such as tree strikes or hails.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Quantum dot; Nanotechnology; Materials science; Photoelectrochemical cell; Solar cell; Energy source; Photovoltaic system; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Optoelectronics; Photovoltaics,http://journalarticle.ukm.my/5423/,journal article,,no

This project aims to evaluate the electrical energy produced from the sustainable building ADREAM, located in LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse. Initially, the Energy Simulation Software Pleiades+Comfie (P+C) was employed for the global Dynamic Thermal Modeling of the building. Thus, the P+C software served as a reliable tool for the modeling of the electrical production from the installed PV panels. In order to estimate the performance of this model, its accuracy was compared to that of an optimized solar irradiation model (Matlab), built from literature references. A description of the ADREAM building is provided, along with the methodology of the two simulations. The simulated results of PV energy production were compared to measured data.

1631,153-584-765-832-408,A method for generating hourly solar radiation profiles on building rooftops accounting for cloud cover variability,2015,"Building Integrated Photovoltaic systems (BIPV) are gaining popularity as urban energy systems move towards decentralization. The calculation of the incoming solar radiation for building rooftops at a high temporal resolution is a key input to perform an energy balance of buildings within the larger context of an urban energy planning exercise and to control the supply and demand of energy. Solar radiation on building rooftop surfaces is highly stochastic due to highly variable cloud cover. Hence, for improving the accuracy in calculating the energy potential of BIPV, it is important to incorporate varying cloud cover in the simulation approach. This study presents a GIS based methodology for calculating hourly solar radiation on building rooftop surfaces taking into account the variability in cloud cover. The location of the study is the Fluntern weather station in Zurich, Switzerland. The r.sun module of the open source GIS software suit GRASS is used to calculate the clear sky irradiation (CSR). To account for the cloud cover, a reduction factor called the clear sky index (KC) which is dependent on the cloud cover is applied to the calculated CSR to obtain the real sky radiation. KC is calibrated for different values of cloud cover and time of day using measured meteorological data spanning a time period from 1981 to 2014 from the weather station. The hourly cloud cover is predicted through a discrete state Markov process. KC, the measured cloud cover, the simulated clear sky radiation are then used to obtain the real sky radiation and is validated against the measured values of solar radiation. Results show that the taking into account the cloud cover for calculating radiation reduces the root mean square error and the mean bias deviation by 37% and 86% respectively.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Meteorology; Diffuse sky radiation; Geography; Cloud cover; Weather station; Context (language use); Photovoltaic system; Remote sensing; Sky; Cloud computing,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213400,conference article,,no

When installed in facades, laminated BIPV glass can be installed with different mounting structures and fixing configurations that should ensure mechanical safety and adequate operational conditions (e.g. adequate resistance preventing excessive deflec-tions) along with the safety of users indoor or outside the building. However, so far, the BIPV glass elements are mainly tested as conventional PV products in accordance with the IEC 61215:2005. In detail, in order to assess the mechanical ability to withstand wind and/or snow loads, a standard load test is performed with a pass/fail criteria based on the absence of electrical damages rather than on the assessment of the static behaviour and the limit states for safety and/or operation. For example, the deflections are not evaluated in this approach even though they are an important parameter to check, especially where glass is used as primary building skin such as in case of curtain walls. This paper includes the evaluation of the deflections of laminated BIPV glass ele-ments resulting from the IEC mechanical testing, including the comparison with the limit states prescribed in the Eurocode and other recommendations for laminated glass to be used in buildings.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Eurocode; Mechanical ability; Laminated glass; Load testing; Limit (music); Structural engineering; Construction site safety,https://repository.supsi.ch/7821/,conference article,,no

In a traditional PV panel, current mismatch between the series-connected cells (due to irradiation differences of differential aging) limits the generated power output by either reducing the overall current or by bypassing the substring containing the limiting cells. A reconfigurable panel can respond to such a situation by changing the connections to a more favorable configuration, allowing the majority of the cells to operate at their MPP. This paper elaborates on such a topology and its components (high current switches, wiring). To get a clearer picture of the added value of such a reconfigurable panel, a detailed energy yield analysis was performed which includes the performance of those added components. The simulation model used for this analysis is calibrated with extensive measurement results. A comparison of that model and corresponding measurements will be discussed. The analysis shows that a reconfigurable PV panel can outperform the traditional panels when suboptimal conditions are predominant, as encountered for instance in BIPV.

How to predict the visual impact which solar installations on the aesthetic cultural value of these buildings has been a heated debate in Switzerland (and throughout the world). The usual evaluation method to describe the visual impact of BIPV is based on semantic and qualitative descriptors, and strongly dependent on personal preferences. The evaluation scale is therefore relative, flexible and imprecise. This paper proposes a new method to accurately measure the visual impact which BIPV installations have on a historical building by using the saliency map method. By imitating working principles of the human eye, it is measured how much the BIPV design proposals differ from the original building facade in the aspect of attracting human visual attention. The result is directly presented in a quantitative manner, and can be used to compare the fitness of different BIPV design proposals.

Additionally, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the BIPVT system was performed using ANSYS Fluent. The findings of this work demonstrate that the BIPVT has a good potential to improve the sustainability of the building by reducing the nominal energy needs to achieve thermal comfort, reducing up to 48% the total energy needs for heating and cooling compared to the base case.

One of the key points of sustainable urban environments is the need for an increase in the densification of the population. A by-product of increased densification however, is a reduction in the area per person that can be used for on-site renewable energy generation from the solar resource. Where previously it would have been possible to have a photovoltaic array and solar water heater side-by-side for a free-standing household, this may not be achievable in a high-density living situation. As a counterpoint to this issue, the design of a novel combined photovoltaic/thermal for building integration (BIPVT) solar collector is analysed and discussed. The panel has a higher efficiency per unit area, than an array of photovoltaic panels in combination with solar thermal panels. In addition, by integrating electricity generation, water heating and facade elements it is possible to reduce the complexity associated with traditional solar installations while also achieving an architecturally sensitive appearance. As such the BIPVT is ideally suited to environments where facade space with suitable solar access is limited, or where large numbers of people share a single building. In this study, the influence of key design parameters on the performance of a BIPVT collector are presented and discussed.

Its unique features of transparency, light weight and flexibility allow the OPV application where conventional photovoltaics reach their limits, such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Many projects are emerging for this type of application, such as facade integration, and it is important to guarantee that the lifetime of the OPV devices is similar to what it is being integrated to. As a relatively recent technology, there are not many studies focusing on the stability and lifetime of OPV and even though standard tests have been defined for means of comparison of technology development, there are no appropriate qualification tests to assure the durability of the modules. As accelerated tests are not yet correlated to real operational conditions either, outdoor tests are a must to study degradation behaviors and pathways to improve the lifetime. In this paper, outdoor tests have been conducted for a period over a year to compare different photoactive materials and assess their stability under operational conditions.

Measured DC electrical power from photovoltaic panels in the city of Kirkuk, Iraq, is analyzed for different orientations, cleaning schedules, and tracking procedures, and relevant conclusions are drawn. The results obtained so far for Jan-Jul 2013 indicate that a horizontal panel raised 2m above the roof (H2) produces about 14% more output than those mounted directly above the floor. In January, the output from a two-axis tracked panel (2T) was about 20% higher than that of a one-axis tracked panel (1T) whilst the latter has an output higher by about 10% than a panel tilted at ~35°,TL. A south-facing vertical (VS) panel produces about 70% more power than a horizontal (HA) ones, but in June the effect is reversed with HA producing 200% more power than VS. However, a TL panel outperforms both. Simple empirical equations are suggested to model the outputs of VS, HA, and TL panels. The equations simplify design procedures for predicting the power output of PV systems.

1651,173-668-980-691-138,ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF THE USE OF SOLAR ENERGY IN KUWAIT,2013,"ABSTRACTIn Kuwait, the current method of generating electricity using conventional power plants cannot provide beneficiaries with adequate service unless more plants are constructed. In addition to their high cost, these plants cause environmental damage, creating the need to investigate sources of clean energy. This study assesses the technical and economic feasibility of implementing Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy in residential houses in Kuwait. Data and information were collected and the appropriate PV system was selected according to cost and PV specifications. Next, the equivalent annual costs of the PV system with various discount rates were estimated together with the cost per kWh both for new and existing houses. Third, the annual reduction of CO2 emissions resulting from implementing grid-tied PV systems was calculated. Taking into consideration the financial savings from CO2 reduction, the cost per kWh was estimated and compared with the current cost. The purported discount rate adopted by the Kuwaiti government's long term plan is 6.7%. However, a range of discount rates from 0% to 20% was applied and results obtained. The results showed that with a 6.7% discount rate the annual savings on energy costs for a new house and a previously constructed hose were KD 745 and ICD 653 respectively. The results also revealed the payback periods for the PV system for these houses are 7 and 7.4 years respectively. We concluded that integrated PV (BIPV) solar energy is economical and technically feasible in Kuwait when the discount rate is equal to, or less than, the break-even point of 10.36%.JEL: N7KEYWORDS: BIPV, Equivalent Annual Cost, Payback Period, Renewable Energy, and Solar Energy.(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)INTRODUCTIONEnergy consumption in Kuwait is increasing at an 8% yearly rate (Alotaibi, 2011). Population growth has resulted in the need for new infrastructure, especially in forms of electricity and water. This has doubled the loads of electrical power plants, and creates challenges to find alternative sources of electrical power. Residential buildings consume a high percentage of electricity and can reach 70% of total production during the summer (MEW, 2010). The current method used to produce electricity cannot effectively provide beneficiaries with acceptable service throughout the year, unless more new conventional power plants are constructed (Al-Faris, 2002). Conventional power plants are major oil consumers. The consumption in these plants alone would reach 26.5% of total Kuwaiti oil production by 2020. With the oil production rate of 2008, all the produced oil would consumed locally by 2027 (Alotaibi, 2011).Kuwait is considered one of the highest carbon dioxide emitters for each person in the world (30.2 ton a person). This occurs mostly because of gases emitted from conventional electricity plants (UN data, 2010). Emissions of toxic gas from traditional power generators, which run on fossil fuels, are harmful to the environment and humans alike. Because of these circumstances, there is a growing interest in renewable and eco-friendly energy sources such as solar. Solar energy is a renewable energy sources that can be a partial substitute for fossil fuel thereby avoiding most of the negative impact of fossil fuels (Kumar and Tiwari, 2009). Photovoltaic (PV) technology is proven and easy to use and the global PV market is predicted to increase substantially in the future (Hoffmann, 2006).LITERATURE REVIEW:There are several reasons to strengthen the research results and to decrease future risks when utilizing PV technology. Efficient and accurate data from recent studies will help overcome any unexpected entries to the PV in the future. Efficiency of the solar modules is increasing while manufacturing and selling prices are decreasing (Al-Salaymeh, et al., 2010). The average estimated payback time (EPBT) is from 3.25 to 4.5 years for most silicone types of solar (Seng, et al. …",Payback period; Renewable energy; Energy source; Environmental science; Electric power; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Agricultural economics; Solar energy; Fossil fuel,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ibf/gjbres/v7y2013i2p73-82.html,journal article,,no

The priority is the retrofitting of existing buildings as zero-emission to improve their energy efficiency with renewable energy technologies pulling the market with cost-effective strategies. From the first age of photovoltaics (PV) mainly integrated in solar roofs, we rapidly moved towards complete active building skins where all the architectural surfaces are photoactive (Building Integrated Photovoltaics - BIPV). This change of paradigm, where PV replaces a conventional building material, shifted the attention to relate construction choices with energy and cost effectiveness. However, systematic investigations which put into action a cross-disciplinary approach between construction, economic and energy related domains is still missing. This paper provides the detailed assessment of a real multifamily building, taking into account retrofit scenarios for making active the building skin, with the goal to identify the sensitive aspects of the energetic and economic effectiveness of BIPV design options. By assuming a real case study with monitored data, the analysis will consider a breakdown of the main individual parts composing the building envelope, by then combining alternative re-configurations in merged clusters with different energy and construction goals. Results will highlight the correlation between building skin construction strategies and the energy and cost parameters by identifying the cornerstones for enhancing efficiency. The outcomes, related to the total life cost, self-consumption/sufficiency, in combination with different building design options (facade, roof, balconies, surface orientations, etc.), provide a practical insight for researchers and professionals to identify renovation strategies by synergistically exploiting the solar active parts towards lower global costs and higher energy efficiency of the whole building system.",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Built environment; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Building design; Building envelope; Efficient energy use; Roof; Retrofitting; Building material; Cost effectiveness; Computer science; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13153827,journal article,,no

To address this need, we developed an algorithm for the geometric sampling of the parts of the building envelope achieving a minimum irradiation threshold, with the aim of defining uniformly-covered active solar surfaces. The proposed methodology is implemented in a flexible parametric design platform and tested in a case study in Neuchâtel (Switzerland).

One of the strategies to realize a significant CO2 reduction is by integrating photovoltaic modules in the building envelope (BIPV). Disadvantages of BIPV include a possibly lower energy output and a possibly decreased life span due to the lack of optimal cooling of the PV modules. Currently, cooling of PV modules is usually realized by passive back-string ventilation, which is under strain when integration PV modules in the building envelope. In this study, a comparative field study of BIPV is conducted in the field lab 'The District of Tomorrow'to generate insight into BIPV efficiency as a function of back-string ventilation. This paper presents a selection of the monitoring results of the realized system, consisting of 24 PY modules in 4 segments with a total of 6000 Wp output with different amounts of back-string ventilation. The measurements indicate that in a moderate climate BIPV solutions without back-string ventilation result in increased operating temperatures, lower electricity output and condensation between PV modules and rooftop surface.

1659,180-797-054-542-242,Integrated Renewable Energy Infrastructure - Challenges And Opportunities,2011,"Traditional approach to the sustainable built environment focuses on the passive design and energy efficient heating and cooling technologies. Most of the green building rating systems reward buildings with integrated renewable energy power generation, such as building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) or wind power. Experience indicates that while such initiatives can be justified by achieving the desired rating outcome or a demonstration of the owner's commitment to sustainability, rarely they can be justified from the commercial point of view. In many cases such initiatives begin to be seen as a cynical attempt at scoring points rather than demonstrating efficient design or environmental sustainability. While renewable energy generation is undoubtedly the right way for the future, the commercially viable strategies for integrating them with the built environment receive much less attention. It seems that the renewable energy sector and the built environment sector have not yet developed a framework for the integration of the two, both on the technical, commercial and legal levels. Smart grids can provide partial solution to such integration.

This exploratory research identifies issues which arise following the specification of BIPV in non-residential construction projects. Rather than treating the inclusion of a new technology as a technical problem, the research explores the issue from a sociotechnical perspective to understand the accommodations which the project team makes and their effect on the building and the technology. The paper is part of a larger research project which uses a Social Construction of Technology Approach (SCOT) to explore the accommodations made to working practices and design when Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) technology is introduced. The approach explores how the requirements of the technology from different groups of actors (Relevant Social Groups or RSG's) give rise to problems and create solutions. As such it rejects the notion of a rational linear view of innovation diffusion; instead it suggests that the variety and composition of the Relevant Social Groups set the agenda for problem solving and solutions as the project progresses. The research explores the experiences of three people who have extensive histories of involvement with BIPV in construction, looks at how SCOT can inform our understanding of the issues involved and identifies themes and issues in the specification of BIPV on construction projects. A key finding concerns the alignment of inflection points at which interviewees have found themselves changing from one RSG to another as new problems and solutions are identified..

1662,185-504-483-388-247,The impact of domestic load profiles on the grid-interaction of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems in extremely low-energy dwellings,2010,"A BIPV system may produce the same amount of electricity as consumed in the building on a yearly base, however the simultaneity of production and consumption needs to be evaluated. The present paper aims at quantifying the impact of domestic load profiles on the integration of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) electricity generation in a Belgian climate. In this work, a multi-zone TRNSYS model for a dwelling with compression heat pump for both space heating and domestic hot water (DHW), domestic consumers and on-site photovoltaic generation is set-up. As a consequence of the dynamics of the electricity demand and supply, it is necessary to use small time-steps. The model is used to assess the influence of the user behaviour, the influence of the dimensioning of the heating installation and gridinteractions on the auto-consumption of BIPV systems. Furthermore, bottle-necks for possible large-scale implementation of on-site photovoltaic generation are illustrated. The electricity consumption of a dwelling typically peaks when the habitants wake up and arrive back home, whereas the BIPV system shows a profile depending on the local weather and system characteristics. By putting the results of the requested and delivered power within the same model, it is shown that the domestic load profiles due to human behaviour do not coincide with the output of photovoltaic systems. A dwelling with a classic gas-fired heating system is compared by a dwelling equipped with a electricity-driven heat pump for space heating and DHW. Herefore, the cover factor is defined, i.e. the ratio of domestic demand that is covered by the BIPV, for a BIPV installation with a yearly electricity production that equals the yearly domestic demand. If no attempt is made to bring the electricity demand and supply into balance on instant basis, a cover factor of 0.42 is found if a classic heating system is installed, denoting that more than half of the produced electricity will be passed on to the grid and withdrawn on another moment. If a heat pump is used for space heating and DHW, the cover factor decreases to 0.29. If one aims to drastically decrease the domestic electricity demands from the main distribution grid, the installation of a BIPV might not be sufficient due to the imbalance of domestic electricity demand on the production by the BIPV system. An integrated approach including the current practice, the domestic installation, the mixture of loads and the grid is necessary.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Automotive engineering; Electricity; Heat pump; Heating system; TRNSYS; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Structural engineering; Dimensioning,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/267004/2/2010+RERC+Baetens+DeConinck+Helsen+Saelens+_+The+impact+of+domestic+load+profiles+on+the+grid-interaction+of+BIPV+systems+in+extremely+low-energy+dwellings.pdf,journal article,,no

Many studies have been performed outlining the life cycle energy benefits of PV technology. However, there has been limited number of studies dedicated to the life cycle cost impacts. The aim of this paper is to identify whether life cycle cost analysis is the best approach to determining the cost contributors or savings associated with this technology. This paper has been structured similarly to previous life cycle energy studies to consider the cost implications involved within each area of the products lifecycle. Amongst many new developments, traditional silicon based units have been challenged by the introduction of new organic systems; and recent studies highlight that these systems offer major cost reductions. Based on an analysis of current literature, this paper identifies that the recent growth and development of both organic and silicon based systems have had a considerable effect on the cost of PV cells.

On a cold day in Europe the cell temperature will be at 30C and compared to a summer temperature of up to 80C. As each ten temperature increases the efficiency of the crystal silicon photovoltaic will reduce 10%. So considering the whole year, running at 25C for Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) will be an ideal temperature target to achieve in order to keep PV cells at their peak efficiency in Europe. Passive heat removal technique was applied for thermal regulation of PV using Phase Change Material (PCM) integrated on the back of the PV. The temperature in PV can be effective regulated, but the low thermal conductivity of the PCMs is one of the main problems for this application. This paper details the results of a theoretical investigation and analysis of PV temperature control and solar thermal energy storage achieved using phase change materials with different types of fins, structure and PCMs. The predicted performance provides an insight into the effects of using various quantities of different PCM materials with different types of fins and thermal storage for selected ambient conditions of temperature and insolation.

The focus of the evaluation is the electricity exchange with the grid. The temporal mismatch between local electricity production and electricity consumption is evaluated using established indicators such as the autonomy and self-consumption. Moreover, it is analyzed during which times electricity is consumed from the grid, and how high the fraction of Wind and PV in the energy mix is during the time of consumption. The latter is quantitatively expressed using the Grid Support Coefficients GSCabs and GSCrel proposed by the authors. HVAC operation accounts for roughly 43% of the total electricity consumption of the considered building. With a conventional HVAC control concept based on heating and cooling curves, an annual autonomy rate of 42% and a self-consumption rate of 43% are achieved. In an alternative control scheme, the trajectory of heat and cold delivery to the zones is altered such that the self-consumption of the locally produced electricity is maximized. The remaining electricity demand for HVAC operation, which has to be covered from the public grid, is shifted to times of a high availability of Wind and PV power in the energy system. With this energy management scheme, the autonomy and the selfconsumption rate are increased to 50% and 53%, respectively. The fraction of Renewables in the electricity consumed from the public grid is increased by 15% (relative). Thermal comfort in the offices is only moderately affected by the shifting of the heating and cooling loads.

In Cameroon, the electricity access is less than 5 % in rural areas against 50 % in urban areas. All sectors combined the Cameroonian final energy consumption amounts to approximately 5235 kilo-tonnes of oil equivalent (Ktoe) and 73 % of this energy are assigned for residential use. This energy can be considerably reduced with the development of low energy buildings using Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV), since it has been proven an effective solution to achieve significant energy savings and conservation. However, photovoltaic (PV) panels produce a substantial amount of heat, while generating power. Consequently, BIPV’s concept, where the photovoltaic (PV) panel is integrated on the building envelops has significant influence on the amount of heat transfer through the building fabrics, and could affect the indoor air temperatures and the comfort of the occupants, since, it changes the thermal resistance of the building envelops. In this paper, the effect of the BIPV on the indoor air temperatures and humidity (IATH) of a multiple storey buildings under the tropical climatic conditions of Yaounde, Cameroon has been modelled and analysed. Two cases of BIPV made of 290 m2 area of PV have been considered, i) roof integrated and ii) facade integrated. In addition, building orientation, roof pitch and the building materials are also been explored and optimised to provide the best combination.

However, development pattern that excessively relies on the natural source is impossible to provide a sustainable development way for us. As a result, we should combine renewable energy with new energy technology as the aim of economy. It means that it is urgent to exploit new energy.

As available area is maximised in Building Integrated PV (BIPV) systems, shading is an inevitable consequence. The presence of partial shading in a PV array leads to multiple power peaks in the power-voltage curve, due to bypass diode sections being triggered, and an increase in module mismatch losses in the array. A building energy design software, Integrated Environmental Solutions, is used to determine the shadowed area on PV modules throughout the year, incorporating the PV system location and geometrical models of obstacles around the array. Photovoltaic system topologies incorporate the following device options: central inverters, a power converter for each series string of PV modules, and a Module Integrated Converter (MIC). A model has been developed to compare a DC-AC parallel MIC configuration with a series string DC to AC power inverter configuration, for a commonly occurring shading pattern, and a simulation is used to compare the power delivered by the topologies. The model is broken up into the following stages: i) geometric modelling of array and surrounding obstacles, ii) solar PV power characteristic model as a function of temperature and irradiance, and iii) inverter efficiency model for each topology.

The adoption of new technologies, such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), but also new and innovative business models such as community solar, have both been identified as relevant drivers. However, the adoption of BIPV is still encountering numerous barriers that hinder its more widespread deployment within the solar PV market. The goal of this research effort was to assess whether community solar as a successful business model for the adoption of conventional solar PV could be equally promising in relation to the further adoption of BIPV. For this purpose, we conducted an experimental survey (n=413) to compare customers’ willingness to buy a community solar offer exclusively associated with BIPV to a community solar offer solely designed with conventional rooftop solar PV. Our results revealed no significant difference between willingness to buy based on our experimental treatment (BIPV vs. conventional PV), indicating that community solar can be a successful distribution channel for the further adoption of BIPV.

Smart windows are the next generation of windows, which can change their thermal and optical properties to control indoor environmental conditions. Electrochromic (EC) windows can control solar energy and provide visual comfort. These windows can be used with other tools such as various glazing types, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and building energy management system (BEMS). This paper aims to evaluate the effect of EC windows, various glazing types, BIPVs and BEMS on energy consumption of high-rise office buildings. A model was created and several inputs were entered into the model. Then, annual simulations evaluated the effect of EC windows and other parameters on energy consumption of the building in four climate conditions of Iran. First, the effect of EC windows and various glazing types on energy consumption of the building were identified separately. Afterward, 12 different scenarios were defined to evaluate the effect of using both EC windows and optimal glazing type on energy consumption of the building. Then, BIPVs were combined with EC windows and photovoltachromic (PVC) windows were modeled using inputs of EC windows and BIPVs. In the end, BEMS was combined with PVC windows and had a positive effect on energy consumption of the building in all climate conditions. Finally, simulation results indicated that energy consumption of the building reduced up to 35.57% using EC windows and other tools.

This article presents a dataset for the solar incident radiation and electricity production of PV systems in the north and south orientations in a dense urban area (in the northern hemisphere). The solar incident radiation and the electricity production of two back-to-back PV panels with a ten-centimetre gap for one year are monitored and logged as primary data sources. Using Microsoft Excel, both panels’ efficiency is also presented as a secondary source of data. The implemented PV panels are composed of polycrystalline silicon cells with an efficiency of 16.9%. The results depicted that the actual efficiency of the south-facing panel (13%–15%) is always closer to the standard efficiency of the panel compared to the actual efficiency of the north-facing panel (8%–12%). Moreover, although the efficiency of the south-facing panel on sunny days of the year is almost constant, the efficiency of the north-facing panel decreases significantly in winter. This phenomenon might be linked to the spectral response of the polycrystalline silicon cells and different incident solar radiation spectrum on the panels. While the monitored data cover the radiation and system electricity production in various air conditions, the analysis is mainly conducted for sunny days, and more investigation is needed to analyse the system performance in other weather conditions (like cloudy and overcast skies).

One aspect of research in this parlance engages the technological and the social dimensions of building innovation, which promote the use of renewable technology as a mitigation strategy. The challenge, however, is that the end-users or building clients do not always have sufficient awareness and information regarding these technologies to guide their decision to accept it. Consequently, the diffusion of said innovations is slow, and the environmental or building problems they were invented to solve persist at the expense of both humanity and the environment. This study, therefore, focuses on a quantitative investigation to ascertain the level of awareness and interest of residents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) as an example of renewable energy-based building technology. In this study, 289 residents participated, following the distribution of a questionnaire to demographically distinct individuals. This distinction was used in the analysis to highlight different groups such as, gender, generations, and occupational background of the respondents. The findings of the study show, firstly, that there is a high level of awareness of BIPV in the sample. The study also shows that comparing awareness with each of these demographic variables produced a second layer of findings. For example, the statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference between the level of awareness and any of the demographic characteristics of the study participants. However, there is a significant statistical difference (p = 0.000) between awareness and interest in BIPV. In concluding this study, recommendations for further research that elaborates other statistical variables and tests, as well as a follow-up qualitative investigation are planned and outlined for future studies. The findings of this investigation may be of benefit to researchers, policy makers, as well as energy companies and marketing agencies within and outside the region.</jats:p>",,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13126665,journal article,,no

However, in order to precisely predict the overall performance of building integrated facade collectors it is crucial to have a validated model that represents such systems. In this study, a combined optical and thermal model was developed to describe the performance of a facade integrated BIPVT solar concentrator system and subsequently was validated with a physical prototype. Using the validated model, it was shown that key parameters such as tube spacing, and thermal conductivity between the solar cell and the absorber have a significant effect on the overall efficiency.

1695,012-198-288-860-757,Performance of photovoltaics in non-optimal orientations: An experimental study,2015,"Abstract Buildings are one of the biggest energy consumers in our world. The concept of zero energy building (ZEB) is an attractive approach in order to reduce the energy requirement of buildings leading to more sustainable cities. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is one suitable technology for providing electricity to the buildings with a minimum impact. Traditionally, photovoltaics (PV) have been installed looking for maximum yearly energy production. In this work the feasibility of PV working in non-optimal orientations will be explored by using two experimental setups: a photovoltaic facade with a southwest orientation and an architectural model of a building with the facades in the cardinal points, covered with PV. The results show interesting features, considering yearly and hourly generation profiles. Although the annual energy production for the facades and the roof is between 50% and 76% of an optimum angle installation, the facades have a more stable production along the year: monthly production can vary by a factor 2 vs a variation of factor 4 for irradiance. Moreover, the hourly production profiles are displaced from noon so they can match the demand. With some current net metering proposals, non-optimal orientations could even be more economical than the maximum producing orientation.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Civil engineering; Architectural engineering; Zero-energy building; Electricity; Roof; Net metering; Facade; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.11.035,journal article,University of Salamanca,nz

1697,051-866-052-616-788,Effect of flow distribution on the photovoltaic performance of a building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) collector,2012,"Abstract The phenomenon of non-uniform flow distribution and its influence on thermal performance within a traditional solar thermal collector is well known. Its effect on the photovoltaic conversion of a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector however has received little attention. In this study an investigation has been carried out to determine what effect flow distribution will have on the photovoltaic yield of a BIPV/T collector of various size. A three step numerical analysis was conducted to model flow distribution, temperature variation, and photovoltaic yield for a PV/T collector of various design (manifold sizes), geometric shape (aspect ratio), and operating characteristics (mass flow rate and flow direction in manifolds) in order to vary flow uniformity within the collector. The results revealed that flow distribution within the collector will have a significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of a hybrid PV/T collector. For the scenario where flow distribution was most uniform, photovoltaic performance was improved by over 9% in comparison to a traditional photovoltaic (PV) collector operating under the same conditions. For poor flow however, performance was only improved by approximately 2%. Parameters found to influence flow distribution include the manifold to riser pipe ratio where a ratio of 4:1 was found to be ideal and that increasing to a 6:1 ratio offered negligible improvement. Additionally it was found that array geometry (characterised by its aspect ratio in this study) plays an important role on both flow distribution and photovoltaic yield. This study has identified that the optimal mass flow rate is dependent on the shape or aspect ratio of the array.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Aspect ratio; Materials science; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Thermal; Solar thermal collector; Photovoltaic system; Mechanics; Flow (psychology); Mass flow rate,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2012.02.013,journal article,University of Waikato,nz
1698,062-782-304-359-433,Estimation of photovoltaic conversion efficiency of a building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) collector array using an artificial neural network,2012,"Abstract Earlier studies have shown that the thermal efficiency of a solar thermal collector is influenced by the quality of coolant flow distribution within the array. The quality of flow distribution within a header/riser type fluid network is influenced by a number of parameters including the coolant mass flow rate, the direction of flow in the manifolds, and most importantly the geometry of the array. As a building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) collector will be a made to measure product, meaning its dimensions will be dictated by the specific roofing and energy requirements of the customer, the issue of flow distribution and its effect on both thermal and photovoltaic performance raises some concern. In order to quantify the detrimental effect flow distribution may have on the photovoltaic output of a BIPVT array, a numerical approach was presented by authors in earlier work where factors known to influence flow distribution were varied. The authors demonstrated that photovoltaic output may be severely hindered if the issue of flow distribution is not adequately addressed. In this new study we use this numerical method to additionally show that photovoltaic output is not always improved by reducing the fin width W (by increasing the number of risers for each module) despite the theoretical rise in fin efficiency F as a consequence of flow distribution. Under certain scenarios it was shown that a single riser will in fact improve PV output and also reduce system installation cost and complexity. The combination of these new finding and results previously obtained by the authors highlights the need in selecting the optimal design parameters to meet the specific requirements of each installation. The numerical approach carried out to calculate PV output however was time consuming and computationally intensive and therefore not feasible to perform for each and every customer. To address this issue, the authors have proposed in this paper to train an artificial neural network which can be used to approximate the photovoltaic yield of an array of specified shape operating under parallel ⧹ reverse flow in the manifolds and also with one or two fluid channels cooling each string of cells. By approximating the yield for each scenario, the optimal configuration can then be chosen. It was found that the neural network can be successfully trained for this specific application offering a fast alternative to the original numerical approach.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optimal design; Electronic engineering; Solar thermal collector; Flow (mathematics); Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Header; Thermal efficiency; Mass flow rate,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2012.09.001,journal article,University of Waikato,nz

In this study, the design of a novel building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) solar collector was theoretically analysed through the use of a modified Hottel–Whillier model and was validated with experimental data from testing on a prototype BIPVT collector.; ; The results showed that key design parameters such as the fin efficiency, the thermal conductivity between the PV cells and their supporting structure, and the lamination method had a significant influence on both the electrical and thermal efficiency of the BIPVT. Furthermore, it was shown that the BIPVT could be made of lower cost materials, such as pre-coated colour steel, without significant decreases in efficiency.; ; Finally, it was shown that by integrating the BIPVT into the building rather than onto the building could result in a lower cost system.

Most commercial devices are not designed for this purpose. Here, we present a specific design for a system based on a single multi-lobe shadow-ring that allows us to measure diffuse irradiance with several tilted pyranometers – from 60 to 90 degrees from the horizontal plane – and on different azimuth angles. This first prototype allows us to measure in the four cardinal directions. The ring is designed to minimize the covered celestial dome observed by each sensor. Moreover, the complete device needs a very small installation area and its simplicity means it is inexpensive and easy to operate. The measurements have subsequently to be corrected with a geometrical correction factor that takes into account the portion of the sky vault blocked by the shadow-ring.

The spatial distribution of solar diffuse energy outstands as one of the most critical factors in order to improve performance simulations.

Thus, in this paper, 30 transposition solar diffuse irradiance models, from the semiphysical classical ones to the newest non-parametric models, are reviewed, classified according to their characteristics and evaluated against empirical 10-min averaged diffuse irradiance values gathered from high precision pyranometers placed on vertical positions facing the four cardinal directions. Models’ performance is evaluated by several statistical estimators and a benchmark has been carried out by a non-parametrical aggregating procedure. Results show that the most accurate models appear to be the non-parametric ones. From these, The Multi-Layer Perceptron obtains the best results.

The energy demand of the individual apartments and the common area services inside the building is calculated by means of daily energy usage of the residents for a typical day. The aggregate demand of the residential building, comprising of 100 residential units and common area services, is calculated. The estimation of power profiles of the PV generation system is carried out with the help of PVGIS. At the end, the economic analysis of the proposed net metering scheme is presented. The net metering policy is found to be feasible up-to 50 kWp PV capacity when it is applied on the common area services only and the billing is carried out individually. When it is implemented on the aggregate energy demand of the entire residential building, the annual savings are observed for installed PV capacity above 80 kWp.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Environmental economics; Business; Civil engineering; Aggregate demand; Economic evaluation; Common area; Net metering; Incentive; Metering mode; Distributed generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/eeeic.2017.7977733,conference article,University of Engineering and Technology,pk

These BIPV projects have been modelled and evaluated for different geographic locations because the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2018/844/EU) has resulted in country‐specific regulations and situations aimed towards the reduction in energy consumption, and hence the CO2 emissions of built environments. Moreover, the geographical variation of irradiation affects the performance of different BIPV projects on different locations. The results of our study show that the return of investment of BIPV projects across 12 countries took (on average) 13.3 years. Furthermore, the residential projects —as compared to non‐residential buildings— were mostly energy plus buildings with an average self‐sufficiency of 110% due to their low energy consumption. In conclusion, most BIPV projects resulted in realistic energy performances (on average: 761 kWh/kWp.year), low payback times (10 years for residential and office buildings), and modelled unique design features.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Architecture; Consumption (economics); Return on investment; Architectural engineering; Energy balance; Energy consumption; Architectural design; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10248860,journal article,Design Engineering,pl

Investors typically rely on national standards and guidance when developing specifications that define PV system components. However, PV technology performance is promoted and reported solely in terms of cost and energy efficiency goals, without holistic consideration of other contributing factors such occupants’ ability to effectively manage PV systems to reduce the peak demand issue linked with PV systems in the UK. This paper examines policy, design, installation, handover and use of domestic PV systems. An in-depth case study of 20 households in a new-build UK development demonstrates the challenges related to introducing PV systems in housing. Key findings identify the need for complete rather than partial design team involvement and capacity building for inexperienced residents as well as building industry actors. PV systems are perceived by policy makers and industry as requiring very limited occupant interaction with limited potential to impact on energy use practices—thus an integrated PV system learning process incorporating occupant feedback is disregarded. Poor individual occupant learning support and PV system feedback onsite makes this learning difficult.",Handover; Risk analysis (engineering); Engineering; Peak demand; Key (cryptography); Operations management; Relation (database); Efficient energy use; Capacity building; Photovoltaic system; Process (engineering),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2015.12.002,journal article,Wrocław University of Technology,pl

The operational efficiency of a PV roof tile, together with the construction optimising the air cooling efficiency, were the main points of plans realized at this research stage. The article describes the experimental research consisting of the assessment of electrical, thermal, and total efficiency, as well as exergy efficiency and parameters of a commercial photovoltaic (PV) roof tile, which back wall was cooled by flowing air. An influence of various cooling duct depths and various volumetric flow rates on the system operation was analysed. During the tests, a solar light simulator and a radial fan, providing the assumed volumetric flow rate of cooling air were used. It has been proven that the depth of the cooling duct and the air volumetric flow rate have a crucial impact on the obtained results. Air cooling the back wall of the PV roof tile, lowered the average surface temperature by a maximum of 6.3 K, while the temperature difference, between the surface next to the cooling air inlet and the surface next to its outlet, was a maximum of 23.4 K. Both values were obtained for air cooling with a volumetric flow rate equal to 4 m3/h and a channel depth of 25 mm, with a solar irradiance of 900 W/m2. The overall efficiency was calculated as a sum of the electrical an thermal efficiencies. Its maximal obtained value was about 32%, wherein the highest thermal efficiency was at the level of 27%. An exergy analysis was performed and the exergy efficiency between 5.08% and 9.94% was determined. These results are promising for future utilization of the system consisted of the PV roof tiles together with the cooling ducts.",Air cooling; Exergy; Nuclear engineering; Heat recovery ventilation; Volumetric flow rate; Duct (flow); Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Thermal efficiency; Exergy efficiency,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.117255,journal article,Gdańsk University of Technology,pl

Therefore, technicians involved in building design, management and approval should be able to understand and apply nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) concepts in both new buildings and renovation of existing ones. At European Union (EU) level there are large differences in commitment to the EU targets and the construction of nZEB between countries. It is thus urgent to develop studies to demonstrate the advantages of the nZEB and ZEB design process, increasing the awareness of both building clients and other stakeholders regarding this issue. In this context, the aim of this paper is to assess the energy and environmental life cycle performance of different renovation scenarios (Basic Renovation, nZEB and ZEB) for multifamily buildings in Portugal. This will be focused on the goals of the nZEB and ZEB design process and on the contribution of solar systems (solar thermal collectors, STCs, and photovoltaic panels, PVs) in the achievement of those goals. The results presented in this paper show that, in the Portuguese climate and for a typical multifamily building, it is possible to overcome 100% of the energy needs for acclimatization and domestic hot water (DHW) preparation with the integration of solar systems. From our results, it is also possible to conclude that a significant amount of energy and carbon emissions are avoided for every renovation scenario during the considered lifetime (30 years) and that the nZEB and ZEB scenarios are cost-effective with attractive payback times.",Energy economics; Business; Architectural engineering; Zero-energy building; Building design; Context (language use); European union; Photovoltaic system; Greenhouse gas; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2016.04.053,journal article,University of Minho,pt

DSSC can be transparent with various degrees of transparency, which makes it suitable for window application in buildings. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the transparency, the efficiency of DSSC and the overall energy efficiency of a building when DSSC is applied as window system. It is shown that while the efficiency of less transparent DSSC is generally higher due to higher short circuit current density (Jsc) from the thick electrode, it does not necessarily maximize the overall energy efficiency of a building. This is because lighting conditions of the building varies with the transparency of the window. The optimum condition should be carefully considered with the transparency of window as computationally simulated in terms of energy generation and consumption. We also find that different orientations of window in the building affect the optimum conditions of DSSC.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optics; Engineering; Energy conversion efficiency; Efficient energy use; Solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Dye-sensitized solar cell; Engineering physics; Short circuit; Transparency (human–computer interaction),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.03.010,journal article,KAIST,ru

In Egypt, enjoying more than 250 uninterrupted sunshine days, the development potentials of Solar Energy appears very obvious, despite the relatively higher cost of this energy (in kW/h) compared to other RES technologies such as wind energy. Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) are one of the best ways to harness solar power, which is the most abundant, inexhaustible and clean of all the available energy resources. Considering the above, the aim of this paper is to present in a coherent and integrated way the major potentials and constraints affecting the development of applying solar energy to existing buildings in Egypt. The scope of the paper is to provide insight to the possible opportunities of applying solar energy in existing buildings, based on a current analysis of case studies from Egypt which introduced photovoltaic in roofs, facades, skylights and solar shades. The paper is structured along three sections. In Section 1, emphasis is given to describe an overview of the significance of applying solar energy in the Egyptian real estate market. The available methods and various issues are included along with the presentation of a list of (BIPV) applications. In Section 2, the supporting opportunities for (BIPV) applications in Egypt are analyzed through some case studies such as (Egas Building) in Cairo which has integrated 389 panel of monocrystalline on the top of the building to produce approximately 40% of the building needs with benefit of grid connection.

The paper focuses on the domestic sector and aims to: (a) establish levels of energy reduction, informed by leading standards (such as Passivhaus in Germany), that can be achieved taking into account the complex local socio-cultural context and environmental factors, and (b) propose a low energy reference definition with a view of encouraging energy retrofitting programs and enforcing domestic low carbon interventions. An energy simulation environment is employed to simulate and analyze energy consumption patterns of three proposed low carbon prototype houses that reflect current house typology and space layout in the country. The three proposed homes offer a reduction in energy consumption of up to 71.6%, compared with similar houses. Based on these findings, a domestic energy performance reference is proposed with energy consumption ranging between 77 kWh/m2 and 98 kWh/m2.

Measures in the existing housing stock, such as installing photovoltaics (PV), provide a means of contributing to the goals above. The purpose of this paper is to study how the organization of property management and the decision-making structure in tenant-owner cooperatives (TOCs) in Sweden facilitates or hampers the adoption of large-scale residential building applied photovoltaics (BAPV) in this housing sector. Data collected through seven semi-structured interviews of executive board members in seven housing cooperatives were descriptively analyzed and the results indicate that the decision to adopt BAPV in TOCs does not follow the common frameworks of adoption of innovations. The choice by TOCs to adopt BAPV depends more on the wish to lower operating costs than on efforts to promote a sustainable environment and various principal-agency problems during the decision-making process, as well as during the implementation phase create challenges to the adoption of BAPV.

To reach a point where PV is considered in all building projects it has to be cost effective, aesthetically appealing, and reliable. Issues that are all connected to how a system is mounted. This paper aims to describe the current situation regarding the mounting of PV systems on Swedish buildings and for this, two separate studies have been conducted. The first study comprises well over 400 existing PV systems with a minimum peak power of 10 kW, and the second includes interviews and a questionnaire survey with system suppliers and owners. The results show that the most common mounting position is steep-slope roofs, mostly pantile or metal, followed by low-slope roofs. A majority of the installations on steep-slope roofs are applied on top of the roof, parallel to the slope. The most common mounting types for low-slope roofs are tilted and parallel systems secured to the roof. The share of ballast-only systems is however increasing. The most common building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications are modules used in shading devices and modules integrated in steep-slope roofs.

Our studies show that the yield of both the panels are comparable, with a difference of only 0.7% with the MC-Si a bit higher. However that is within the limits of power tolerance for the panels and is not conclusive. A sunny day output power profile shows the CIGS panels have a significant advantage during the noon hours with a lower voltage drop and higher hourly specific yield. Our cost analysis of CIGS solar panels show that they are potentially cheaper than aluminum composite panel cladding (including system) and only slightly more expensive than ceramic tiles (panels only). Our analysis of the solar insolation (PSH) on east and west facing sidewalls shows they are about half the insolation on the roof. Although this increases the payback period, one would need to subtract the original potential cost of the facade that it has replaced. The use of PV panels also effectively creates a double skin facade structure and provides additional insulation to the building. This suggests that one could install BIPV solar as an alternative to the traditional building materials such as ceramics and aluminum composite panels at comparable costs.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Payback period; Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells; Roof; Double-skin facade; Facade; Environmental science; Photovoltaics; Noon; Engineering physics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.12.754,journal article,Temasek Polytechnic,sg

Recognising the unique resource constraints of Singapore, HDB has looked towards solar PV. The Solar Capability Building Programme for public housing involves a wide-scale solar PV test-bedding in both new and existing towns. This paper documents the unique challenges that HDB faced (and still faces) in its drive towards sustainability, a key feature of which is the introduction of solar PV to public housing. The main sections covered are: • HDB's main objectives of starting the Solar Capability Building Programme, • The journey since 2008 till now, • HDB's vision of turning Punggol into a zero-energy (for common services) town, • Various challenges faced and how they were overcome, • Findings from the systems installed so far, and • The future direction HDB is headed in. The focus of the paper is on how HDB is working towards achieving its aims for the Solar Capability Building Programme despite the high solar PV system cost, small number of industry players and lack of grid parity or tariffs.

1745,043-649-735-017-53X,Photovoltaic integrated shading devices (PVSDs): A review,2018,"Abstract Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) have come to be regarded as a promising technology that reduces the life-cycle costs of building construction and generates energy simultaneously. In this regard, photovoltaic integrated shading devices (PVSDs) constitute an important part of BIPVs and play a role in generating power by transforming the unwanted radiation and in reducing cooling energy consumption. Despite the expansion of the literature in recent years (2016–2017), a comprehensive review exploring the studies on PVSD is still lacking. To fill this research gap, a systematic review of the literature on PVSD was conducted. The current body of knowledge on PVSD is summarized, including aspects such as PVSD types, PV material, orientations, tilt angles, and research approaches. Several noteworthy conclusions are drawn based on the quantitative analysis of 43 journal papers on PVSD. The majority of the studies are South Korea-based (35.9%), followed by China, Greece, and Switzerland. In addition, the focus of the literature has been on the technical approach (76.5%), office building (73.3%), and equator-facing orientation (57.1%). Only 15 types of PVSD have hitherto been studied, with the emphasis on two types: the inclined single panel and horizontal louvres between double layers. Moreover, 21 architectural cases of PVSD in practice are presented and two obstacles to PVSD development are discussed. Suggestions for future study are made, including intensifying the focus on PVSD in countries with the significant solar source, such as Singapore and Australia; diversifying the exploration of multiple PVSD types (instead of only two types); and emphasizing multi-objective optimization studies on PVSD. The review can serve as a quick reference for future research and may find utility in providing an overview of PVSD to both industry practitioners and academicians.",Architectural engineering; Body of knowledge; Cooling energy; Solar source; Building construction; Future study; Computer science; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2018.05.067,journal article,National University of Singapore,sg
1746,044-749-735-320-955,Lifetime performance of semi-transparent building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) glazing systems in the tropics,2014,"Abstract The use of semi-transparent BIPV as a form of on-site renewable energy generation in energy efficient sustainable buildings is increasing. Its popularity is due to its contribution towards zero-(or even plus) energy buildings. In urban cities where the buildings have limited rooftop area but large facade areas, adopting semi-transparent BIPV windows is an alternative for conventional windows. The semi-transparent BIPV windows not only solely generate electricity but also affect the buildings' electricity usage through daylighting and heat gain/loss. In tropical climates where it is hot and humid all year round, the importance of window facade elements is even more pertinent due to high cooling load from the solar heat gains. This paper examines the life cycle environmental and economic performance of commercially available semi-transparent BIPV modules for window application under the tropical conditions of Singapore. Energy simulations, previously performed, were adopted to conduct a life cycle assessment to determine the long term performance in terms of energy and carbon emissions, as well as cost considerations. The EPBT and EROEI for the modules ranged from 0.68 to 1.98 and 11.72 to 34.49 respectively. After considering government subsidies, some modules cost lower than conventional windows, while half of the remaining modules, achieved payback periods of 1.1–13.1 years. These performance indicators were used to form a decision-making tool to assist architects and building designers in the selection of BIPV modules for windows during the early design stages.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Daylighting; Civil engineering; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Efficient energy use; Life-cycle assessment; Facade; Cooling load; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.12.044,journal article,National University of Singapore,sg

The main electricity generator is the 142.5 kWp grid-connected BIPV system on the roof of the building. This paper presents the first performance assessment of the BIPV system over 18 months of operation following the guidelines of the IEC standard 61724 for measurement, data exchange and analysis. The performance analysis shows a good overall performance ratio of 0.81. The average array yield is 3.86 h/d and – after subtracting the capture and system losses of 0.58 h/d and 0.16 h/d, respectively – the resulting final yield is 3.12 h/d averaged over all arrays. The system and array efficiencies are 11.2% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to the nameplate PV module efficiency of 13.7%. The overall inverter efficiency is 94.8%. All the results are based on irradiance measurements with calibrated pyranometers. In addition, a classification of daily irradiance is presented, dividing the days into overcast, intermediate and clear days with each high, medium and low temporal change of irradiance levels. Results show that the performance ratio is lowest for clear days with high irradiance fluctuations, due to higher capture and system losses. Despite relatively higher losses, the absolute final yields are higher for clear days.

A three-dimensional model is developed based on the typical BIPV facade. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with the shear stress transport (SST) κ-omega turbulent model is used in the study. The effects of geometric configurations on the BIPV cell temperature in steady state are evaluated including the sizes of the bottom and top openings and the depth of the back air cavity (or so-called cavity depth). When the sizes of the inlet and outlet openings are the same, the effects on the decrease of cell temperature are limited. By enlarging the bottom (inlet) opening, the impact of ventilation in the cavity behind is more significant and the cell temperature decreases. Cavity depth is also a vital factor affecting BIPV cell temperature. The paper identifies the optimal cavity depth of approximately 100–125 mm. Flow disturbance and a vortex may be observed at the bottom and top of the air cavity, respectively, as the cavity depth increases which negatively affects the ventilation causing these flow disturbances to increase the cell temperature. Thermal effects of environmental conditions are compared with regard to two selected BIPV configurations. The wind velocity and the attack angle also have an obvious impact on cell temperature.

To accomplish this objective, three BIPV systems located in Singapore with photovoltaic (PV) systems playing an aesthetically appealing role in their architecture were analysed in detail for a one-year period. The systems were analysed regarding the available solar irradiation, the shading profiles and the resulting yield and performance ratio (PR) in order to compare the performance of different subsystems with variable architectural characteristics and string configurations. All systems are partially shaded in the early morning or late afternoon, a common situation inherent to BIPV systems. Results show that even with a theoretical non-optimal combination of azimuthal deviations and tilt angles, some PV systems show better performances in terms of yield and performance ratio than those which are installed at more ideal conditions. The high ratio of diffuse irradiation in Singapore; the distance of shading obstacles and times when shading occurs; and the subsystem and string configurations strongly influence the systems performance results. With the declining costs of PV systems, BIPV can offer attractive solutions with high integration appeal, architectural sophistication and the promotion of sustainable energy supply.

1753,074-068-680-857-118,Optimization and evaluation of naturally ventilated BIPV facade design,2018,"Abstract To improve the photovoltaic (PV) power generation, the temperature control measures and optimization of BIPV systems are critical, particularly in tropical weather. There are two categories of cooling mechanisms, i.e. passive and active cooling. In the present study, a simplified numerical model is set up to evaluate the effect of passive cooling of BIPV facades with various configurations, including the PV periphery openings (i.e. area ratio), behind air cavity depth, wind velocity and attack angle (0 to 90 degrees) on the cell temperature of BIPV module. A parametric study is performed. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is applied to predict the cell temperatures under various BIPV facade configurations and environmental conditions. The results of the CFD model show that in the case where the areas of the top and bottom openings are equal, there is limited air ventilation at the behind air cavity. However, the BIPV surface temperature has a significant drop when the inlet opening at the bottom is enlarged, compared with that of the same area of inlet and outlet. Changing the wind attack angle from 0o to 60o has limited effect on the BIPV cell temperature, which results in a variation of less than 5 oC. However, a dramatic temperature drop of around 15oC is observed when the attack angle is larger than 60o. The influence of air cavity depth is studied with the fixed top and bottom opening size ratio. By varying the air cavity depth from 30 to 200 mm, a lower PV cell temperature can be achieved.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Drop (liquid); Active cooling; Wind speed; Computational fluid dynamics; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Temperature control; Mechanics; Passive cooling,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2018.09.003,journal article,National University of Singapore,sg
1754,084-421-278-830-192,Singapore Modules - Optimised PV Modules for the Tropics,2012,"Abstract The sunbelt regions of the globe on either side of the equator represent a vast potential for the generation of photovoltaic (PV) electricity. However, PV modules deployed in tropical regions face a different set of environmental conditions than PV modules deployed in temperate regions where the majority of today's PV markets exist. The tropical climate poses several unique challenges for PV modules. High year-round humidity is the greatest threat to PV module durability, while high ambient temperatures and highly diffuse light conditions can negatively affect PV module output power. Given this situation, SERIS is undertaking a research project to develop “Singapore modules” which are specifically tailored to perform better and last longer in tropical climates. This paper presents an overview of the scope of the project, as well as first key findings and results. The first phase of the project involved a detailed study of the state of the art in today's PV module technologies. Ten different module technologies were chosen for evaluation, representing today's most commonly used PV technologies. These commercial modules were subjected to standard accelerated aging tests, as well as tightened accelerated aging tests to identify strengths and weaknesses of the various technologies. Outdoor performance monitoring of each module type is also on-going. The results obtained during the first phase of the project are being used to guide the development of Singapore modules. First prototype Singapore modules have been fabricated, and a 10 kWp testbedding system has been installed in Singapore.",Engineering; Architectural engineering; Electricity; Scope (project management); Performance monitoring; Photovoltaic system; Tropics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2012.02.047,journal article,National University of Singapore,sg
1755,085-031-123-506-69X,Temperature Dependent Photovoltaic (PV) Efficiency and Its Effect on PV Production in the World – A Review☆,2013,"Solar cell performance decreases with increasing temperature, fundamentally owing to increased internal carrier recombination rates, caused by increased carrier concentrations. The operating temperature plays a key role in the photovoltaic conversion process. Both the electrical efficiency and the power output of a photovoltaic (PV) module depend linearly on the operating temperature. The various correlations proposed in the literature represent simplified working equations which can be apply to PV modules or PV arrays mounted on free-standing frames, PV-Thermal collectors, and building integrated photovoltaic arrays, respectively. The electrical performance is primarily influenced by the material of PV used. Numerous correlations for cell temperature which have appeared in the literature involve basic environmental variables and numerical parameters which are material or system dependent. In this paper, a brief discussion is presented regarding the operating temperature of one-sun commercial grade siliconbased solar cells/modules and its effect upon the electrical performance of photovoltaic installations. Generally, the performance ratio decreases with latitude because of temperature. However, regions with high altitude have higher performance ratios due to low temperature, like, southern Andes, Himalaya region, and Antarctica. PV modules with less sensitivity to temperature are preferable for the high temperature regions and more responsive to temperature will be more effective in the low temperature regions. The geographical distribution of photovoltaic energy potential considering the effect of irradiation and ambient temperature on PV system performance is considered.",Electrical efficiency; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Operating temperature; Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Production (economics); Sensitivity (electronics); Solar cell; Performance ratio; Photovoltaic system; Engineering physics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2013.05.072,journal article,Nanyang Technological University,sg

In the second stage of research, the whole PV systems in the case study are simulated in EnergyPlus energy simulation software with several PV performance models including Simple, Equivalent one-diode and Sandia. The predicted results by different models are compared with measured data and the validated model is used to provide simulation-based energy yield predictions for wide ranges of scenarios.

The airports that host commercial flights are often national landmarks and architectural showcases. They are typically large, horizontal and free of shading, and are also ideally suited for the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems for onsite generation of clean and renewable electricity. While ground-mounted PV generators should be designed for optimum performance, PV systems integrated on buildings should also consider aesthetics. We have analysed building-applied and building-integrated PV systems (BAPV and BIPV). In BAPV, optimised PV module orientation and tilt angles were proposed for maximum annual output, while in BIPV, modules were accommodated respecting the existing architecture of airport buildings. Two Brazilian airports were analysed, comparing the performance of BAPV and BIPV using two “off-the-shelf” PV technologies. On average, both the installed peak power and the energy generation density were found to be higher for BIPV (100% and 87%, respectively), while the final annual energy yield was 7% higher for BAPV.

The last stage will also require a transition from the grid to onsite storage of each energy carrier needed for the operation of building technical systems (BTS). In the article, the method of optimization of energy storage is presented and demonstrated on the example of all-glass NZEB office buildings in different climates. The impact of energy storage was estimated by production matching fraction fpr,match and by the building autonomy factor (AUT). The metrics were determined by dynamic modelling of buildings with south-facing glazed BIPV facades. It was found that optimum energy storage capacities are in the range between 0.01 and 0.06 kWh/m2 for heat storage, 0.03 to 0.08 kWh/m2 for cold storage and 0.03 to 0.04 kWh/m2 for batteries per 1 m2 of useful area of the building.

The installation of a (BIPV) systems have certain advantages compared to a traditional PV or thermal system mounted in a separate structure on the roofs. The main purpose of this project to evaluate the feasibility of using combined PV/T collectors in typical Syrian building installations, and to test this system as a optional solution for a public, governmental or service sector buildings, there are two main advantages for such systems, large area of the roofs are suitable for mounting such systems, and specially for periodic uses or where short term thermal and electrical energy outputs are needed. PV/T collectors being considered in this paper are collectors which can provide both electrical and thermal energy. An experimental model of PV/T air collector was designed and constructed on the roof of Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in University of Aleppo, then it was inspected. This model consisted of a conventional air solar thermal collector with PV cells. One of the main conclusions of this study is that the thermal linking between PV cells and absorber plate is very important for the thermal efficiency. The electrical efficiency is depend on the flow rate of the air which passes through the collector, because the PV cells are on the inlet, then the cool air will pick the heat generated from the PV cells, so it will become relatively warm after passing under the PV cells, and thus PV cells will have a higher electrical output.

Basically wafer-based crystalline-Si PV technologies have the advantage of higher module efficiency as compared to thin-film PV, but thin-film PV has the advantage of lower production cost. The silicon-based solar PV needs light-induced charge separation at the p-n junction between two slices (wafers) of doped silicon in either single-crystal silicon (sc-Si) or polycrystalline (poly-Si). However until recently thin-film PV modules both amorphous silicon (a-Si) and non-silicon thin film technology have been advantageous developed. Metallic based modules such as cadmium telluride, CdTe and copper indium gallium diselenide, CIGS thin-film PV technologies have currently efficiencies of 16.1% and 15.7%, respectively. A high efficiency makes thin-film PV technologies more competitive with wafer-based crystalline-Si PV. This study investigates the electricity generation of both silicon based and non-silicon based solar PV modules. The implementation uses solar irradiation with average of higher than 18 MJ/m2.day in high solar radiation provinces in Thailand. A High solar radiation is observed in mostly in central and the east regions of the country.

The present work is situated within these latter perspectives. This paper presents a numerical study concerning a double skin laminar flow in a vertical DSF-channel asymmetrically heated under realistic environmental conditions. Finite volume based commercial software Ansys Fluent is used to solve the governing equations. Our interest for this work is to study: (i) the influence of the vertical spacing (0 < S < A) between two identical heat sources (PV panels) on a facade, (ii) the influence of the alternation of numerous heat sources on the two channel facades, on the flow dynamics and heat transfer. The current numerical results were compared to those that were found experimentally with a very good agreement between them. They showed that the flow characteristics inside the DSF-channel strongly depend on the spacing between the two heat sources. In addition, the alternation of heat sources with adiabatic zones allows a significant modification of the flow structure.

1774,043-426-318-193-710,Sizing methodology based on design of experiments for freshwater and electricity production from multi-source renewable energy systems,2018,"Abstract In remote areas, the vital need is production of drinking water and the provision of electrical energy for housing. Often the only sources of energy are based on renewable energies with storage to create a local micro-network. This paper investigates the optimal design of embodied energy for water treatment by reverse osmosis, coming from brackish water (6 g/l) and with a double storage that is done in a drinking water tank and in batteries for electricity. Taking account wind and photovoltaic potentials in such system for assessing its performance implies its simulation over long periods of time. This can drastically increase the CPU time cost related to the design step, especially if the system energy management and sizing are sequentially optimized into a two-level optimization process. In order to solve this problem and accelerate the system simulation, meta-models are used for representing the system constraints and objectives. These meta-models are built by the design of experiments method. From realistic data, the results of this paper show that the contribution of the meta-models divides by two or three the design time by obtaining values of the sizing parameters close to the dynamic simulator depicting the real operation of the whole system.",Renewable energy; Embodied energy; Electricity; Process engineering; Sizing; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Energy management; Electric potential energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2018.08.008,journal article,Tunis University,tn

1776,112-662-894-539-439,Smart power management of a hybrid photovoltaic/wind stand-alone system coupling battery storage and hydraulic network,2018,"Abstract An off-grid energy system based on renewable photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT) generators is coupled via converters to electric and hydraulic networks. The electric network is composed of consumers and of a battery bank for electrical storage, while the hydraulic part is made of motor-pumps and hydraulic tanks for water production and desalination. Both battery and water tanks are used to optimize the power management of both electric and hydraulic subsystems by ensuring electric load demand and by reducing at the same time water deficit following the operation of the renewable intermittent source. Thus, both electric and hydraulic subsystems are strongly coupled in terms of energy making necessary to manage the power flows provided by renewable sources to optimize the overall system performance. In this paper, two kinds of management strategies are then compared in the way they share the hybrid power sources between the storage devices (battery and tanks) and the electrical/hydraulic loads. The first approach deals with an “uncoupled power management” in which the operation of electrical and hydraulic loads does not depend on the state of the intermittent renewable sources: in particular, hydraulic pumps are operated only taking account of water demand and tank filling but without considering power sources. On the contrary, given the available power produced by the sources, the second class of strategy (i.e. the “coupled management strategy”) consists of a “smart” power sharing between the electrical and hydraulic networks with regard to the battery SOC and the tank L 1 and L 2 . A dynamic simulator of the hybrid energy system has been developed and tested using a MATLAB environment. The system performance is shown under the two investigated approaches (uncoupled vs coupled). Several tests are carried out using real meteorological data of a remote area and a practical load demand profile. The simulation results show that the “coupled strategy” clearly outperforms the classical “uncoupled” management strategies.",Automotive engineering; Renewable energy; Power management; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Battery (electricity); Hydraulic pump; Electrical load; Wind power; Hybrid power,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2016.08.009,journal article,Tunis University,tn

It has been observed that most of the studies that are mounted on the building and include a tracking system are small-scale experimental studies. The aim of this article is to present a systematic analysis with a low investment cost, a low operating cost, and high reliability, in a real application especially for roof applications in buildings. Three buildings in the same location and with the same roof area were selected.

The energy generation system is connected to the network with a double-sided meter, and there is a double-sided energy flow. The energy produced is used to meet the energy needs of the vehicle charging station and common areas of the buildings. Although the single-axis tracking system is 27.85% more efficient than other energy generation methods, the manually adjusted method has proven to have the shortest amortization time.

Although conventional TN-LC cells are widely used to adjust the brightness in many display applications, the sheet polarizers used in such cells decay when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays and have a low light efficiency. Accordingly, in this study, a sub-wavelength metal grating PBS is used to replace not only the sheet polarizers in the conventional TN-LC cell but also the upper and lower alignment layers and transparent electrodes. Therefore, a translucent a-Si:H solar cell integrating with the novel TN-LC cell with the sub-wavelength metal grating PBS could improve power efficiency and durability in UV ray environment. The experimental results show that the transmittance gap between the “on” and “off” states of the enhanced translucent a-Si:H solar cell/novel TN-LC cell is of the order of 26.6% (i.e. 4.3–30.9%) for incident light with a wavelength of 800 nm, 6.3% (i.e. 10.8–17.1%) for an incident wavelength of 400 nm and 2.7% (i.e. 0–2.7%) for an incident wavelength of 510 nm. Moreover, it is shown that the novel TN-LC cell increases the maximum electrical power developed by the translucent a-Si:H solar cell and improves its power conversion efficiency by 0.209% in the “off” state and 0.417% in the “on” state.

One of these BIPV elements is the luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). The LSC consists of a transparent plate embedded with luminescent dyes or inorganic particles, and the solar cells are attached on one or more sides. The incoming sunlight absorbed by the luminescent dyes or inorganic particles re-emits at a longer wavelength, and part of the re-emitting light trapped in the transparent plate reaches the PV cell attached on the LSC and convert it to electricity. However, the efficiency of the LSCs is still low at this stage. The surface loss on the top surface of the transparent plate is one of the main losses in LSCs. The prism film in liquid-crystal display (LCD) module is used to collimate the light in the module and enhance the overall brightness, and would be used in the LSCs to enhance the incoming sunlight to the solar cells attached on the end of the transparent plate. Then the design of the prism film is important. In this study, the ray-tracing simulation is used to investigate the optical characteristics of the LSC with the prism film covered on the top surface of the transparent plate.

To overcome the problems, this paper performs several tasks as follows. (1) A hybrid photovoltaic-water/air solar wall (HPSW) system is presented, which combines the air cooling channel and water cooling channel together in one single BIPVT system. (2) The HPSW system can run three modes according to different seasonal needs of the building: ① PV/Air mode in winter, ② PV/Water mode in summer, ③ PV-water/air mixing mode in transition season, which means that the new system is able to satisfy annual demands of the buildings. (3) The HPSW system were experimentally tested in different seasons under different modes during a whole year.

The method of PECVD (Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition) was applied to produce satisfactory high color rendering index (HCRI) BIPV module of good quality with visible light transmittance as high as 26.9%, solar radiation absorptance below 60% and shading coefficient equal to 54%. The thermal and optical properties of HCRI BIPV module are studied in some detail and the results reported. The thermal conductivity and diffusivity of HCRI BIPV module are less than that of Si-based BIPV. The HCRI-BIPV module appeared to be effective in improving the visible transmittance and reducing the absorptance, but the value of SC of HCRI-BIPV module was higher than that of Si-based BIPV. This indicates that there is still a trade-off between day lighting and thermal insulation for designing an optimal BIPV module. Further thermal performance work conducted by a small-sized hot-box with a solar simulator lamp revealed that heat is mostly absorbed by the HCRI-BIPV and a small amount of heat is conducted into building. The surface temperature on both sides of Si-based BIPV reached a steady state is faster than that of HCRI-BIPV due to the higher thermal diffusivity.

Millions of dollars are spent in order to gain a small percentage in energy conversion efficiency. The power generation of solar PV can be increased using sun tracking technology. However, the design of the sun tracker is usually very complicated and expensive. Units are heavy and prone to breakdown and installation is difficult. In the present study, one-axis three-position (1A-3P) low- cost sun tracking PV as a BIPV was developed and tested. The comparative test of a 1A-3P tracking PV system started from 2010/3/01 was carried out. The single-day increase of energy generation is 39% in clear days. The overall increase of total energy generation from March 1, 2010 to May 31, 2012, is 24.2% in Taipei. The expected overall increase of total energy generation with respect to fixed PV is 37.5% in high solar radiation areas. The installation cost of 1A-3P sun tracking PV is about the same as the regular mounting cost of a conventional rooftop PV system, but providing 25-37% higher PV energy generation efficiency. For cost reduction in structural design, the wall mounting of 1A-3P tracker may cause PV not facing south exactly. A long-term comparative field test was carried out to study the effect of misalignment using three identical 1A-3P tracking PV module facing south, southeast 45°, and southwest 45°. The measured energy loss is 4.42∼6.82% for southeast orientation and 4.31∼6.79% for southwest orientation. The test result shows that the energy loss of 1A-3P PV due to misalignment of south is negligible. Many samples of 1A-3P trackers were manufactured and installed for field test.

1841,002-371-876-303-256,Study on the overall energy performance of a novel c-Si based semitransparent solar photovoltaic window,2019,"Abstract This paper introduces a novel c-Si based building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) laminate. It was produced by cutting standard crystalline silicon solar cells into narrow strips and then automatically welding and connecting the strips into continuous strings for laminating between two layers of glass. The overall energy performance of the BIPV insulated glass unit (IGU) including power, thermal and daylighting performance was investigated experimentally. The daily energy conversion efficiency of the active solar cell area was about 15% on sunny days, but it was less than 12% on cloudy days and overcast days. Due to the combined effect of both the semi-transparent PV laminate and the insulated glass unit, the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the BIPV IGU was as low as 0.25, which was much lower than commonly used glazing windows. Daylight analysis by means of high dynamic range (HDR) cameras and daylight glare probability (DGP) indicated that the BIPV IGU could reduce discomfort glare to some extent compared to clear glass windows. The net energy production of the BIPV IGU was estimated without considering the differences in HVAC energy use in this study. The artificial lighting energy consumption was about 431 W h/day while the average BIPV electricity production for the same period was 1940 W h/day. The net power generation was therefore 1509 W h/day for this BIPV IGU in Berkeley, California. Shading tests for the BIPV IGU were also conducted and the results revealed that the vertical configuration of solar cell wiring in the BIPV laminates was much more sensitive to horizontal shading patterns than vertical shading models. Thus, if shading was unavoidable in some cases, a reasonable arrangement of PV strings should be considered to bring down the energy loss as much as possible. Also, the impacts of environmental factors on the energy conversion efficiency of BIPV IGU were analyzed. Specifically, the power output declined by 0.42% of the peak power for each Celsius degree temperature rise. Thus, if more attention was paid to the heat dissipation issue of BIPV IGU, the overall energy conversion efficiency would be improved.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Daylighting; Zero-energy building; Active solar; Solar cell; Environmental science; Solar gain; Photovoltaic system; Glazing; Engineering physics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.107,journal article,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,us
1842,002-540-361-239-747,Performance and characterization of building integrated photovoltaic panels,2002,"Buildings consume more than two-thirds of the electricity in the United States. The incorporation of photovoltaics into buildings, referred to as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), offers an aesthetically pleasing means of displacing centrally located utility generated power with distributed renewable energy. Building integrated photovoltaics replace conventional building elements such as roof tiles, asphalt shingles, facade elements, and shading devices with photovoltaic modules that perform the same functions but also provide electrical power. A barrier to BIPV implementation is the lack of validated predictive tools to quantify the achievable energy savings. Building owners, architects, and designers need these predictive tools in order to make informed decisions about the economic viability of a proposed BIPV project. The Building and Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is providing high quality experimental data for the development, validation, and improvement of computer simulation tools. Among the computer simulation tools available for predicting the performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems are IV Curve Tracer, developed by Sandia National Laboratories, and PHANTASM, authored by the University of Wisconsin. This paper describes NIST's BIPV ""test bed"" a facility that is used to measure the annual performance of different types of BIPV panels.

This prediction should be attainable based on the commonly available parameters such as system size, orientation and tilt angle. Seve ral commercially available as well as free downloadable software tools exist to predict energy production. Six software models have been evaluated in this study and they are: PV Watts, PVsyst, MAUI, Clean Power Estimator, Solar Advisor Model (SAM) and RETScreen. This evaluation has been done by comparing the monthly, seasonaly and annually predicted data with the actual, field data obtained over a year period on a large number of residential PV systems ranging between 2 and 3 kW dc .

Keywords: BIPV, models, energy, systems, prediction 1. INTRODUCTION From consumer and system integrator perspectives, it is vital to be able to reasonably predict the energy production of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. This prediction should be attainable based on available or desired system sizing parameters such as model of the modules, performance rating, orientation, and derate factor (AC-DC loss). Seve ral-commercially available as well as free downloadable prediction software tools exist. These software tools can be used to calculate the energy production of a desired system by simply computing the system sizing parameters. A few of the most commonly used system sizing tools are cons idered in this study. This study analyzes six of the most commonly used models for predicting the performance of grid-connected, residential PV systems. The actual performance data collected, by Salt River Project (SRP), from 23 residential PV systems in Arizona were compared with projected estimates from six software models. An annual as well as monthly and season al energy analyses have been carried out. 2. METHODOLOGY Six software models are evaluated in this study, namely; PVWATTS, PVsyst, MAUI, California Energy Commissions (CEC) Clean Power Estimator, National Renewable Energy Laboratorys (NREL) SAM, and Natural Resources Canadas (NRCan) RETScreen. A quick overview of these models is presented below. PVwatts is a web based software model that calculates electrical energy produced by a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system. The PVwatts model was developed by the Renewable Resource Data Center (RReDC), which is supported by the National Center for Photovoltaics (RReDC). This model uses a 30 year average daily weather data to determine the daily amount of solar energy (insolation), and uses it to calculate the amount of energy a system will produce based on the systems configuration [1]. PVsyst software is a European based PV system predictor developed by the University of Geneva for the European Center of Energy. This PC software package is suitable for studying simulating and analyzing PV systems. The software is suitabl e for both stand-alone and grid-conn ected PV systems. This software is also useful for analyzing solar-thermal systems and applications [2].",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Data center; Renewable energy; Reliability engineering; Electrical grid; Software; Photovoltaic system; Simulation; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.794245,conference article,Arizona State University,us

Is it a missed opportunity? In the early days of photovoltaic (PV) research, a mainstream opinion envisioned the future of PV as building-integrated and that utility-scale installations would be anomalies. As an example, in 1994, PowerLight introduced a solar roofing tile system, touting it as saving money (avoiding the cost of installing a conventional roof) while integrating PV into an attractive roof. However, today, utility-scale PV accounts for more than half of the world’s PV installations, and building-integrated PV (BIPV) is a niche market (with most rooftop systems being “buildingapplied” rather than “building-integrated”). This motivates the question: “Was integrating PV into the desired product a bad idea or is it an idea whose time has not yet come?” Many things have changed since the 1990s including microinverters and other power electronics, PV with lower temperature coefficients, and demonstration of PV as an accepted technology so that it is not such a risk to builders, potentially giving a fresh opportunity.

Despite the extra cost of the additional circuitry, hardware techniques have recently gained popularity because of their long-term financial benefits. Notwithstanding the growing interest in this topic, review papers that provide updates on the technological developments of the three main hardware solutions, namely micro inverter, DC power optimizer, and energy recovery circuits, are lacking.

For both configurations, air in the cavity between the two building skins (photovoltaic facade and the primary building wall) is heated by transmission through transparent glazed sections, and by convective and radiative exchange. First we describe the model for the naturally ventilated envelope. Validation of the model and the subsequent simulation of a building-coupled system are then presented, which were undertaken using experimental data from the RESSOURCES project (ANR-PREBAT 2007). The dataset comprise measurements from a full scale prototype system installed on a real office building in Toulouse, France. Finally the heating and cooling needs of a simulated building were calculated and the impact of climatic variations on the system performance was investigated.

For that purpose, this paper proposes a methodology that helps BIPV designers to achieve these targets. Its application to a real case shows that the different facades of the building envelope may play a role in the local PV production if their orientations receive sufficient insolation during the hours of electrical consumption. In particular, in the North Hemisphere the possibilities that offer all the external surfaces of the building that are not oriented to the North should be taken into consideration in a first approach, and then those which achieve the best production-consumption match should be analyzed and compared to select the optimum solution.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Grid; Building envelope; Electricity; Load profile; Production (economics); Load management; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.05.073,journal article,United States Department of Energy,us

To increase potential for energy capture in PV systems, particularly those with series string configurations, an improved module integrated dc-dc converter (MIC) with maximum power point tracking has been proposed. This paper investigates the potential power gain provided by these MICs in situations where the architecture or surroundings of a building necessitate that a PV array include panels with differing orientations, which can significantly reduce system efficiency. A flexible, comprehensive simulation model for BIPV systems is developed, which allows for variations in insolation and temperature at the PV cell level, while accurately modeling MICs and their effect on array performance. This model is used to simulate various directional array combinations in series string and parallel configurations for a representative set of climates around the US. Results of these simulations show power gains attributed to both the photovoltaic generator/converter portion of the system and to increased inverter efficiency arising from a constant, controlled string voltage. When differing panel orientations within an array are considered, there is potential for annual power output gains of over 10% for a system with MICs when compared to conventional approaches. Further opportunities for increased energy capture in a BIPV system with MICs are identified and discussed.</jats:p>",Simulation modeling; Engineering; Energy transformation; String (computer science); Electronic engineering; Roof; Engineering simulation; Distributed power; Electric potential; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/es2009-90377,conference article,University of Colorado Boulder,us

A 2D dynamic thermal and electrical mathematical model of the solar BIPV/T component is described and validated first in steady state under a solar simulator and later in dynamic conditions with three tests models and a 35 m2 solar PV/T drying installation test bench mounted in situ. Finally, numerical parametric studies were performed using the validated model by varying the emissivity of some constitutive layers and the air gap thickness. These analyses have demonstrated, as expected, that, in order to cool PV modules and to increase their electrical performance, a relevant choice of their emissivity or of the metal absorber emissivity is important. Also, there is an optimal air gap thickness, of nearly 8 cm in the configuration studied, for which increasing the level of ventilation is less significant and thus permitting the reduction of extractors' electrical consumption.

An auto-connected flyback converter topology processing less than full power is used to provide high gain and perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT). These dc-dc converters interface with cascaded H-bridge inverter modules operating on feed forward control for dc-link voltage ripple rejection. By means of feed forward control, a significant reduction in dc link capacitance is achieved by enduring higher dc link ripple voltages. The dc link electrolytic capacitors are replaced with film capacitors thus offering an improvement in the reliability of the smart PV module. The proposed configuration is capable of producing 120V/ 240V AC voltage. The PV module now becomes a smart AC module by virtue of embedded intelligence to selectively actuate the individual dc-dc converters and control the output AC voltages directly, thus becoming a true plug and power energy system. Such a concept is ideal for curved surfaces such as building integrated PV (BIPV) system applications where gradients of insolation and temperature cause not only variations from PV module-to-PV module but from group-to-group of cells within the module itself.

The solar absorptance of the roof decreased to 0.38 from 0.75 after installation of the BIPV, lowering summertime daily mean roof upper surface temperatures by about 5 °C. Summertime daily heat influx through the roof deck fell to ±0.1 kWh/m 2 from 0.3–1.0 kWh/m 2 . However, summertime daily heat flux from the ventilated attic into the conditioned space was minimally affected by the BIPV, suggesting that the roof was decoupled from the conditioned space. Daily PV energy production was about 25% of building electrical energy use in the summer. For this building the primary benefit of the BIPV appeared to be its capacity to generate electricity and not its ability to reduce heat flows into the building. Building energy simulations were used to estimate the cooling energy savings and heating energy penalties for more typical buildings.",Air conditioning; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Civil engineering; Zero-energy building; Attic; Photovoltaic mounting system; Roof; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.06.032,journal article,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,us

As an alternative, the large-scale application of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, might be a long-term solution in an urban context. This study assessed the overall utilization potential of a building-integrated photovoltaic and wind turbine (BIPvWt) system, which can be applied to a building skin in global urban areas. The first step of this study was to reorganize the large volume of global annual climate data. The data were analyzed by computational fluid dynamic analysis and an energy simulation applicable to the BIPvWt system, which can generate a Pmax 300 Wp/module with a 15% conversion efficiency from a photovoltaic (PV) system and a 0.149 power coefficient/module from wind turbines in categorized urban contexts and office buildings in specific cities; it was constructed to evaluate and optimize the ratio that can cover the current energy consumption.

In fact, more emphasis has been put on the possibility of producing photovoltaic modules able to be integrated, or even to be directly assembled to form the so-called ventilated walls for buildings. This integration can be improved by using, alternatively to glass, other materials for the substrate or for the final “box”, in which the solar cells are encapsulated. A good candidate as a substrate material that substitutes the glass is ceramic. This kind of non-transparent substrates is useful in the substrate configuration solar cell technology. An example of this technology is represented by the Cu(In,Ga)Se2-based solar cells. The challenge in this field corresponds to directly use, as a substrate large dimension ceramic tiles, which are commercially available on the market. For this reason, the process technology developed at ThiFiLab for glass substrates has been transferred on this kind of new substrates and some solar cells have been produced showing efficiencies in the range of 12–14%.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Ceramic; Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells; Materials science; Substrate (printing); Solar cell; Photovoltaic system; Plasmonic solar cell; Quantum dot solar cell; Engineering physics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/crat.201300408,journal article,University of Parma,us

However, the true potential of BPS remains unrealized if trial and error simulation methods are practiced to identify combinations of parameters to reduce energy use of design alternatives. Optimization algorithms coupled with BPS is a process-orientated tool which identifies optimal building configurations using conflicting performance indicators. However, the application of optimization approaches to building design is not common practice due to time and computation requirements. This paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary algorithm which uses information gained during previous simulations to expedite and improve algorithm convergence using targeted deterministic searches.

The various attachment methods within these categories each have pros and cons that affect the labor and cost associated with the install and the system performance.

However, the physical constraints of the building architecture often prevent photovoltaic systems from being installed at their optimal orientation. Recently, it was shown that thin film photovoltaics can be designed for improved angle-dependent responsivity at specific angles. In this study, the complex impact of angular dependency on overall power output is explored based on detailed hourly solar position, location, and flux data. These results demonstrate that reducing the angular roll-off dependence can enhance overall power outputs by 30% or more in fixed orientation configurations depending on the geographical location, orientation, and angle-dependent roll-off characteristics.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Optics; Position (vector); Orientation (geometry); Power (physics); Automotive engineering; Responsivity; Dependency (UML); Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2014.09.031,journal article,Michigan State University,us

While recent efforts have focused greatly on improving the maximum charge mobility that can be achieved in such devices, studies about the stability and reliability of such high performance devices are relatively scarce. In this talk, we will discuss the results of recent studies aimed at improving the stability of OFETs under operation and their shelf lifetime. In particular, we will focus on device architectures where the gate dielectric is engineered to act simultaneously as an environmental barrier layer.; In the past, our group had demonstrated solution-processed top-gate OFETs using TIPS-pentacene and PTAA blends as a semiconductor layer with a bilayer gate dielectric layer of CYTOP/Al2O3, where the oxide layer was fabricated by atomic layer deposition, ALD. Such devices displayed high operational stability with little degradation after 20,000 on/off scan cycles or continuous operation (24 h), and high environmental stability when kept in air for more than 2 years, with unchanged carrier mobility. Using this stable device geometry, simple circuits and sensors operating in aqueous conditions were demonstrated. However, the Al2O3 layer was found to degrade due to corrosion under prolonged exposure in aqueous solutions. In this talk, we will report on the use of a nanolaminate (NL) composed of Al2O3 and HfO2 by ALD to replace the Al2O3 single layer in the bilayer gate dielectric use in top-gate OFETs. Such OFETs were found to operate under harsh condition such as immersion in water at 95 °C. ; This work was funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) through the Bay Area Photovoltaics Consortium (BAPVC) under Award Number DE-EE0004946.",Electron mobility; Field-effect transistor; Flexible display; Gate dielectric; Nanotechnology; Materials science; Printed electronics; Barrier layer; Optoelectronics; Atomic layer deposition; Organic semiconductor,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2238237,conference article,Georgia Institute of Technology,us

Micro-facets are used to induce total internal reflection allowing window glass to function as a wave guide, thus redirecting light onto the back side of bifacial photovoltaic (BFPV) cells. Seasonal variations in the incident angle at solar noon were considered for Chicago, IL. Three optical models were developed using commercial optical software, validating that the optical elements have a significant impact on the amount of light energy allowed to reach the back side of the bifacial cell. Further, an experimental validation was conducted using two commercially available films. Using a 1:1 film to PV-cell ratio, the first film demonstrated a maximum of 26.3% increase in power on the back side of the bifacial cell. The second film type allowed a maximum of 30.2% increase. Both films allowed solar energy to reach the back side of the cell over the range of incident angles that were evaluated, making it useful as a passive solar concentrator. Finally, both 2:1 and 3:1 film to PV-cell ratios were evaluated for each of the two film types. A maximum power increase of 35.1% was observed.

In BIPV, system integration on a glass substrate like windows is essential to cover a large area of a building with low cost. However, the conventional high voltage devices in inverters have to be built on the specially selected single crystal substrates, limiting its application for large area electronic systems, such as the BIPV. We demonstrate a Magnesium Zinc Oxide (MZO) based high voltage thin film transistor (HVTFT) built on a transparent glass substrate. The devices are designed with unique ring-type structures and use modulated Mg doping in the channel - gate dielectric interface, resulting in a blocking voltage of over 600 V.

These advances may resolve significant capability gaps for low-cost, portable, and durable dual-particle imaging (DPI) systems for nuclear safety, security, and safeguard purposes. One such material, a 21% bismuth-loaded polyvinyl toluene (BiPVT), is computationally evaluated as a small, pixelated radiographic array using Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) and Zemax OpticStudio, and it is compared to identical evaluations of EJ-200 and EJ-256 arrays. MCNP software enables estimates of particle interaction and energy deposition, while OpticStudio computes optical light transport within each material. Computational estimates of spatial resolution and relative light collection at 370 kVp are found to agree with experimental results for both EJ-200 and EJ-256 arrays, thereby validating predictions of the same for the BiPVT array. As such, for equivalent exposures at 370 kVp, a BiPVT array may provide $\sim 20\times $ the light collection expected from EJ-200 and $\sim 10\times $ that expected from EJ-256.

Newer forms of green infrastructure, including alternative roofing (green roofs, solar BIPV systems, etc.), have emerged as potential solutions to these urban environmental problems. However, a number of practical and socioeconomic factors are currently limiting their market penetration to a marginal share. This study employs a System Dynamics modeling approach to analyze these hindrances in Orlando’s alternative roofing market, as well as the potential of societal, economic, and developmental investments in different alternative roofing markets to address these issues. Conventional roofs have been found to remain predominant in Orlando’s roofing market under all policy scenarios, with solar roof system being the most mature out of the three alternative roofing markets considered, and consequently has the most potential for future market penetration. It has been found that the studied alternative roof systems (ARSs) reach only a marginal market share in the year 2040, and for this reason, could not result in significant improvements in the studied impact categories at the city level. However, the studied ARSs yield important reductions in all of the impact categories when analyzed at the building level. The results of this study indicate that the alternative roofing market has significant growth potential, but further research, development, and improvement will be essential to achieve more effective, long-term benefits in Orlando.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Urban runoff; Business; Market share; Natural resource economics; Roof; Market penetration; Green infrastructure; Greenhouse gas; Urban heat island,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104556,journal article,University of Central Florida,us

The objective is to (a) develop models that capture the relevant system dynamics and are computationally efficient for subsequent use within model-predictive control (MPC) algorithms; (b) evaluate the energy saving potential of the integrated system and the predictive controller in comparison with baseline operation strategies. An open plan office space at Purdue’s Living Laboratory is used as test-bed, in which the BIPV/T system preheats ventilation air, while also, it is coupled with the building through an air-to-water heat pump and a thermal energy storage (TES) tank that serves as the heat source for the radiant floor heating (RFH). A detailed energy prediction model developed in TRNSYS is considered as a true representation of the building and it is used to identify the parameters of low-order linear time-invariant state-space models. Both gray-box and subspace state-space system identification (4SID) methods are investigated. A simulation study is performed using TMY3 data for West Lafayette, IN during the heating period. The results show that implementation of a deterministic MPC algorithm for the optimal set-point trajectory of the TES tank can reduce the electrical energy consumption of the heat pump by 34.5%. For the BIPV/T configurations tested, the energy saving of the integrated solar system can be up to 45% compared to the baseline operation of the radiant floor heating. The study also investigates the impact of forecast uncertainty for the horizontal solar irradiance on the performance of the predictive controller, with the results showing considerable impact on thermal comfort conditions when the prediction error is higher than 38%.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; HVAC; Solar air conditioning; Automotive engineering; Thermal energy storage; Heat pump; TRNSYS; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2014.11.024,journal article,Purdue University,us

While conventional Si photovoltaics (PVs) are dominant in the current market, second and third generation thin film solar cells based on amorphous Si, CdTe, CIGS, perovskites or organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are often considered as an alternative for BIPV applications since they may offer reduced costs compared to Si PVs. Indeed, recent advances in performance suggest that lightweight, flexible and visibly transparent OPVs can potentially be integrated into windows or other applications to which Si PVs are less well suited. Here, we estimate the cost of high efficiency, semitransparent OPVs (ST-OPVs) based on solution processing in a roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing line. Assuming modules with 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE), a 70% geometric fill factor (GFF), and 95% inverter efficiency, we anticipate a %1.6 per Wp module manufacturing cost that includes the cost of the microinverter to condition the OPV dc output to be compatible with the ac line voltage of the building. The materials and inverter cost comprise ∼90% of the total module cost. Hence, with simplified material synthesis and a lower inverter cost, including marginally improved PCE and GFF, we expect the cost can be as low as $0.47 per Wp. While the module costs ∼60% of the average (uninstalled) double-pane window, we expect the payback period can be as short as 2 to 6 years, suggesting that OPVs can be an economic and attractive candidate for BIPV applications.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells; Manufacturing cost; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Solar micro-inverter; Photovoltaics; Engineering physics; Organic solar cell; Cost estimate,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0se00910e,journal article,University of Michigan,us

Although the energy saving potential of this technology is significant, no systematic thermal analysis model has been developed for optimal system design and integration with building operation. This paper is the first of two companion papers focused on modeling and performance analysis of BIPV/T systems with UTC. In Part 1, energy models are presented for two configurations: UTC only and UTC with PV panels, to predict the cavity exit air temperature and plate surface temperature with weather (incident solar radiation, ambient air temperature, dew point temperature and wind speed) and design (airflow rate or suction velocity and geometry) parameters used as inputs. Nusselt number and effectiveness correlations, representing both the exterior and interior convective heat transfer processes, have been obtained from experimentally validated, three-dimensional, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, using high resolution grids and the ReNormalization Group Methods k–e (RNG k–e) turbulence closure model. The energy models were validated with measurements in an outdoor test-facility. Good agreement was observed between the model prediction and the experimental data, with the root mean square error (RMSE) being within 1 °C for the UTC-only model and within 2 °C for the model of UTC with PV modules.

1883,033-381-361-840-371,Analysis of Potential for Mitigation of Building-Integrated PV Array Shading Losses Through Use of Distributed Power Converters,2010,"Partial shading of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) arrays is very common, as they are limited by building geometry and most often installed in crowded urban or suburban environments. Power losses in shaded BIPV systems tend to be disproportionately large, due in large part to mismatches in operating conditions between panels. Maximum power point tracking at a modular level, which can be achieved through the use of module integrated dc-dc converters (MICs), may be used to mitigate some of these losses. This paper investigates the potential power gain provided by MICs for several representative partially shaded BIPV array scenarios. A flexible, comprehensive simulation model for BIPV systems is developed, which allows for variations in insolation and temperature at the PV cell level, while accurately modeling MICs and their effect on array performance. Shadows from nearby objects are mapped onto the modeled BIPV arrays and simulated on an annual, hourly basis, with varying array configuration as well as object size and placement. Results of these simulations show that the impact of MICs on system power output varies depending on factors such as radiation availability, time shaded throughout the year, shadow size and distribution on the array, and inverter design. Annual power gains of 3–30% are realized for a moderately shaded system with MICs when compared to conventional approaches. Further opportunities for increased energy capture in a BIPV system with MICs are identified and discussed.Copyright © 2010 by ASME",Modular design; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Power (physics); Electronic engineering; Converters; Maximum power point tracking; Distributed power; Photovoltaic system; Power gain,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/es2010-90261,conference article,University of Colorado Boulder,us

Envelope features of large commercial buildings can be properly designed to both enhance PV integration and reduce building energy use. Many studies have been focused on predicting PV performance of designed systems or optimizing building envelope properties to reduce energy consumption.

We present a technoeconomic model that evaluates the sustainable growth rate of perovskite manufacturing companies, focusing on the dual impacts of economies of scale and average selling price on profitability. A cost model for a roll-to-roll perovskite PV manufacturing facility versus scale is presented and used to establish minimum sustainable prices from $3.3/W – $0.53/W for flexible modules manufactured in factory sizes ranging from 0.3 MW/year to 1 GW/year respectively. We use these numbers to calculate the economically sustainable annual growth rates for a company selling photovoltaic modules in different markets, obtaining a wide range of possible values, depending on operating margin and scale of manufacturing. Selling into the mainstream utility market for $0.4/W requires a prohibitively large upfront investment of over $1 billion to establish a profitable manufacturing facility. We show that the required investment, and thus the barrier to market entry for flexible perovskites, can be reduced in two ways: (i) lowering the cost of materials to 70% of current values reduces the initial investment required to <$100 million, highlighting the role of disruptive innovations in related industries, or (ii) selling into niche markets for $1/W or greater, representative of IoT, BIPV, and vehicle-integrated markets, reducing the required initial capital investment to <$10 million.

The module performance decreases as the operating temperature increases. The lifetime of PV modules is compromised by higher operating temperatures as well. A higher operating temperature increases the rate of reaction for several degradation mechanisms of photovoltaic modules. The air gaps between module and rooftop of Building Applied Photovoltaic (BAPV) modules can have a direct impact on cell operating temperature. This paper presents and analyzes the effect of air gap and corresponding temperature on the relative energy yield and lifetime of crystalline silicon BAPV modules based on 1 year of field data collected between March 2009 and March 2010 at the Arizona State University Photovoltaic Reliability Laboratory (ASU-PRL).

However, due to the low heat exchange efficiency of air, overheating issues may occur that can reduce the electrical production of the system, as well as its durability. With the introduction of multiple intakes of air along the PV string, the goal is to improve the heat extraction from all PV panels, while achieving lower and more uniform PV temperatures. This study presents the results of a numerical investigation on the comparison of the performance of single and multiple-inlet BIPV/T systems for a possible retrofit or new buildings, with an example of a potential large scale installation on an office building. The comparison was carried out considering a cold winter and a hot summer day, under varying wind conditions, in terms of electrical and thermal performance, and PV temperature distributions. For the modelling of a multiple-inlet BIPV/T system, a flow distribution model was developed utilizing pressure drop and flow correlations, as well as wind tunnel pressure measurements representing the wind effects on the flow distributions, and a modified energy balance model for the multiple-inlet system. It was found that a multiple-inlet BIPV/T system may have up to 1% higher electrical efficiency corresponding to 7% additional power to the total output of a 120 kW system and up to 24% higher thermal efficiency, while resulting in the lowest and most uniform PV temperatures.",Wind tunnel; Heat exchanger; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Nuclear engineering; Electrical efficiency; Meteorology; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Thermal efficiency; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2016.09.023,journal article,Concordia University Wisconsin,us

With the computer program, the performance of an air-based BIPV/T system with multiple inlets for a cold climate for a solar house is evaluated.

It was produced by cutting standard mono-crystalline silicon solar cells into small strips and then making electrical connections between each strip before laminating the cells between two layers of glass. The overall energy performance and energy saving potential of the BIPV insulated glass unit (IGU) under real world conditions were identified through a side by side comparative study. Compared to the reference IGU, the BIPV IGU had lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) but much higher U-factor. The average HVAC electricity saving of the BIPV IGU was about 10% relative to the reference IGU. Daylighting measurement and analysis were carried out to evaluate the trade-offs associated with the BIPV IGU between daylight, glare, and lighting energy use. The results indicated that the BIPV IGU is better than the reference IGU in reducing discomfort glare. However, if the most conservative viewpoint near the window is used for the assessment, a lower transmittance BIPV IGU is required to bring the overall discomfort levels below the perceptible level. Lastly, the net energy saving potential associated with the novel BIPV IGU was identified based on the power, thermal and daylighting performance. On average, the BIPV IGU saved 16.8% of the total electricity use of the room. Further studies and improvement on the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells, the optimal transmittance as well as the thermal properties would make this technology more energy-efficient and affordable.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; HVAC; Daylighting; Daylight; Automotive engineering; Electricity; Energy conversion efficiency; Environmental science; Solar gain; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2020.12.006,journal article,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,us

The performance modeling of these collectors is examined both individually and in series. For each collector type, a dynamic, finite difference, first-law model has been created using literature correlations for friction. The models were compared to performance data, calibrating the models by scaling of friction terms for best fit. The calibrated models generally agree well with the experimental data; even during sudden changes to ambient conditions. The root mean square error between the unglazed PV/T model and experiment results for the useful thermal energy gain and the outlet air temperature are 7.12 W/m2 and 1.07°C, respectively. The annual source energy performance of the building-integrated PV/T (BIPV/T) array is then simulated for residential applications in seven climate zones of the United States of America. The performance of the BIPV/T array is characterized by the amount of net electrical energy and useful thermal energy produced. The useful thermal energy is defined as the amount of energy offset by the BIPV/T system for water heating and space conditioning. A BIPV/T system composed 87.5% of PV modules, and 12.5% of glazed air heating modules, offsets the same amount of source energy as a roof-mounted PV system of the same area. This array composition increases the thermal energy gain by 47% over a BIPV/T array composed solely of PV modules.Copyright © 2010 by ASME",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Nuclear engineering; Electrical engineering; Engineering; Offset (computer science); Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector; Thermal; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Electric potential energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/es2010-90474,conference article,University of Colorado Boulder,us

In this work, it is considered that the electricity requirement of the building for household users is provided by a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system and the gap between the energy demand and BIPV supply is fulfilled by the FC. The FC is powered by the electrolytic H2 produced when PV power was in surplus. Based on the study of applying the proposed system in seven cities, which clarifies the effectiveness of the integrated BIPV, electrolytic H2 and FC power generation system, a universal system model has been developed in this paper. It has been observed that the monthly power production from BIPV as well as FC system are higher in spring and summer, while they are both lower in autumn and winter at all considered locations. The self-sufficiency rate of the FC system is higher with decreasing households’ number and it has been observed that 16 is the most appropriate number of households in a building, whose electricity demand could be fully covered by the integrated PV and FC system.

1898,048-526-817-892-073,Prediction of Building Integrated Photovoltaic Cell Temperatures,2001,"A barrier to the widespread application of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is the lack of validated predictive performance tools. Architects and building owners need these tools in order to determine if the potential energy savings realized from building integrated photovoltaics justifies the additional capital expenditure. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks to provide high quality experimental data that can be used to develop and validate these predictive performance tools. The temperature of a photovoltaic module affects its electrical output characteristics and efficiency. Traditionally, the temperature of solar cells has been characterized using the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT), which can be used in conjunction with a calculation procedure to predict the module's temperature for various environmental conditions. The NOCT procedure provides a representative prediction of the cell temperature, specifically for the ubiquitous rack-mounted installation. The procedure estimates the cell temperature based on the ambient temperature and the solar irradiance. It makes the approximation that the overall heat loss coefficient is constant. In other words, the temperature difference between the panel and the environment is linearly related to the heat flux on the panels (solar irradiance). The heat transfer characteristics of a rack-mounted PV module and a BIPV module can be quite different. The manner in which the module is installed within the building envelope influences the cell's operating temperature. Unlike rack-mounted modules, the two sides of the modules may be subjected to significantly different environmental conditions. This paper presents a new technique to compute the operating temperature of cells within building integrated photovoltaic modules using a one-dimensional transient heat transfer model. The resulting predictions are compared to measured BIPV cell temperatures for two single crystalline BIPV panels (one insulated panel and one uninsulated panel).

The TEC modules are supplied by the PV panels, reducing the ceiling temperature and therefore maintaining a comfortable temperature for the occupants. A mathematical model is developed in MATLAB to simulate the performance of the hybrid PV-TEC system.

A well known highly efficient collector is the open-loop unglazed transpired collector (UTC) which consists of dark porous cladding through which outdoor air is drawn and heated by absorbed solar radiation. Commercially available photovoltaic systems typically produce electricity with efficiencies up to about 18%. Thus, it is beneficial to obtain much of the normally wasted heat from the systems, possibly by combining UTC with photovoltaics. Combination of BIPV/T and UTC systems for building facades is considered in this paper – specifically, the design of a prototype facade-integrated photovoltaic/thermal system with transpired collector (BIPV/T). A full scale prototype is constructed with 70% of UTC area covered with PV modules specially designed to enhance heat recovery and compared to a UTC of the same area under outdoor sunny conditions with low wind. The orientation of the corrugations in the UTC is horizontal and the black-framed modules are attached so as to facilitate flow into the UTC plenum. While the overall combined thermal efficiency of the UTC is higher than that of the BIPV/T system, the value of the generated energy – assuming that electricity is at least four times more valuable than heat – is between 7% and 17% higher. Also, the electricity is always useful while the heat is usually utilized only in the heating season. The BIPV/T concept is applied to a full scale office building demonstration project in Montreal, Canada. The ratio of photovoltaic area coverage of the UTC may be selected based on the fresh air heating needs of the building, the value of the electricity generated and the available building surfaces.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Heat recovery ventilation; Building envelope; Process engineering; Solar architecture; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Solar energy; Photovoltaics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2010.10.008,journal article,Concordia University Wisconsin,us

Using the results of field measurements, essential parameters pertaining to the power generation, thermal and optical characteristics of semi-transparent PV panels are understood. Calculation models presenting the above characteristics are developed and validated. The validated models are incorporated into Energy Plus to carry out overall energy consumption analyses in five climate regions in Japan to assess the energy saving potential of the semi-transparent PV panels. With appropriate optimization measures, the semi-transparent PV top light with 50% radiation transmission rate contributes to a maximum of 5.3% reduction in heating and cooling energy consumption compared with a standard BiPV roof. The effect of daylighting in lighting energy saving is subtle as most of the residential lighting demand occur during night-time. In the aspect of total energy consumption, net energy savings in the range of 3.0–8.7% are achieved for the 50% radiation transmission semi-transparent PV top light case relative to the base case of BiPV roof, where reduction in heating and cooling energy demand contributes most to the total energy saving.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Daylighting; Daylight; Automotive engineering; Energy (signal processing); Range (aeronautics); Roof; Energy consumption; Electricity generation; Telecommunications,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2007.06.016,journal article,Osaka University,us

The VCS concept is based on an integrated thermal–structural design with active storage of solar thermal energy while serving as a structural component – the basement floor slab (∼33 m2). This paper describes the numerical modeling, design, and thermal performance assessment of the VCS. The thermal performance of the VCS during the commissioning of the unoccupied house is presented. Analysis of the monitored data shows that the VCS can store 9–12 kWh of heat from the total thermal energy collected by the BIPV/T system, on a typical clear sunny day with an outdoor temperature of about 0 °C. It can also accumulate thermal energy during a series of clear sunny days without overheating the slab surface or the living space. This research shows that coupling the VCS with the BIPV/T system is a viable method to enhance the utilization of collected solar thermal energy. A method is presented for creating a simplified three-dimensional, control volume finite difference, explicit thermal model of the VCS. The model is created and validated using monitored data.

For solar cells, broadband ARCs are desirable for efficient application over the entire solar spectrum. As previously demonstrated, such broadband ARCs can be made by electrochemical etching of Porous Silicon (PS) with graded refractive index. However, for efficient production there are a number of processing considerations which needs to be addressed. In this work the effects of electrolyte aging and sample inhomogeneities are investigated and quantified, using spectroscopic ellipsometry. A range of PS properties are extracted from the ellipsometric data by use of a graded Bruggeman Effective Medium model. Significant changes in porosity and thickness are detected and attributed to electrolyte aging. A positive correlation between thickness and porosity indicates that inhomogeneities across the sample are due to local variations in current density or HF concentration. Multilayered PS samples show smaller horizontal variations in porosity and thickness than single PS layers in our setup (© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A full scale-test collector is monitored over several weeks in the summer of 2008 and measured data is used to calibrate a heat transfer model implemented in a common scientific computing software package. Following calibration, error between experimental measurements and the calibrated model outputs is within the limits of measurement uncertainty. Collector simulations are constructed to examine thermal efficiency, the effectiveness of the collector as a night-sky radiator, the effect of heat collection on electrical efficiency, the effect of two common exterior convection coefficients on collector performance, and the effect of eliminating the air gap between the PV and absorber surfaces. Overall collector thermal efficiency is relatively low compared to existing collectors. However, the potential low cost of the system could allow larger collector areas to compensate for low efficiency, especially in warm climates. Combined thermal and electrical efficiency can be as high as 34%.

Facade surfaces are assumed to be in the form of curtain walls, allowing for freedom in the design of surface geometry. The design parameters that are investigated include geometrical aspects, solar technologies integrated in the facades and the surface ratio and positioning of windows. The study is carried out for Montreal area (45 N). Preliminary results indicate that some designs are significantly more advantageous than a flat south facing facade. Electricity generation of PV system integrated in 50% of the surface of a facade shaped as folded platecan be increased by up to 56% as compared to theflat south facing facade, which serves as reference. When PV coverage is increased to 2/3 of the facade surface area, electricity generation can reach a factor of 2.8 of the reference. Heating and cooling loads are affected as well by the design. The increase of heating load can be mitigated by increasing the transparency of PV panels. The design of folded plates can affect daylighting level and distribution. While the total useful daylighting hours are not significantly compromised, for some configurations, the number of hours with large illuminanceis significantly reduced, as compared to the reference case.",Engineering; Daylighting; Daylight; Curtain wall; Facade; Energy performance; Solar potential; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Structural engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.10.045,journal article,Concordia University Wisconsin,us
1911,063-479-694-706-094,Evaluation of energy supply and demand in solar neighborhood,2012,"Abstract The paper presents a study of solar electricity generation and energy demand for heating and cooling of housing units’ assemblages. Two-story single family housing units, located in northern mid-latitude climate are considered in the study. Parameters studied include geometric shapes of individual units, their density in a neighborhood, and the site layout. The plan shapes of the housing units included in this study are rectangles and several variants of L shape. Site layouts studied are characterized by a straight road, a south-facing or a north-facing semi-circular road. Rectangular units and a site layout with straight road serve as reference for evaluating the effect of shape and site parameters. Results indicate that a significant increase in total electricity generation (up to 33%) can be achieved by the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems of housing units of certain shape-site configurations, as compared to the reference. The energy load of a building is affected by its orientation and shape. Increased heating demand by L variants (by up to 8%) is more than offset by annual electricity production of their BIPV systems (by up to 35%). Heating and cooling loads depend significantly on unit density in a site; Attached units require up to 30% less cooling and 50% less heating than detached configurations of the same site. Variation of surface orientation, particularly in curved site layouts, enables the spread of peak electricity generation over up to 6 h. This effect may be beneficial to grid supply efficiency. Energy balance assessment indicates that some unit shapes generate up to 96% of their total energy use. Neighborhood configurations studied generate between 65% and 85% of their total energy demand.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Automotive engineering; Energy balance; Energy consumption; Unit Density; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Solar energy; Structural engineering; Geometric shape,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.02.021,journal article,Concordia University Wisconsin,us

The objective of this article is to carry out a sustainability assessment of a BIPV system installed in Turkey regarding the three pillars: environmental, economic and social potential impact, in order to develop different indicators. For the socioeconomic analysis, a Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) method was used to estimate production of goods and services, value added creation and employment opportunities. For the environmental evaluation, an Environmental Footprint (EF) analysis was performed. The levelized electricity costs and the greenhouse gas emissions abatement costs were also calculated. Results showed that the socioeconomic effects are relevant, although only a 23% of these effects remain in Turkey. The environmental profile is also good in terms of climate change impacts, showing substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel alternatives for electricity generation. Regarding the life cycle stages of the technology, the highest environmental impacts are produced in the PV manufacturing processes.

However, there are numerous materials and energy inputs that go into the fabrication of the components of PV systems that may carry significant environmental burdens. A life-cycle perspective helps to compare the net environmental benefits of a particular generation. In this effort, we systematically examine design options from feedstock to integration in order to identify current and future opportunities for minimizing the environmental impact of PV systems. We use a combination of process-based and economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIOLCA) to capture both a breadth and depth of information. We decompose a PV system into a set of design and manufacturing choices at each step of the process: 1) feedstock – electronic and solar grade silicon, 2) diffusion – conventional furnace (CFP) and rapid thermal processing (RTP), 3) silicon growth – multicrystaline silicon using electromagnetic casting (EMC) or directional solidification, single crystalline silicon using Czochralski or float zone crystal growth, and amorphous silicon, 4) cell encapsulation and covering – standard ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) versus mixtures containing additives for adhesion strength and standard low-iron glass versus cerium-doped glass 5) module construction – traditional framed module and building integrated frameless glass laminates, 6) integration – sloped roof, flat roof, Building Integrated PV (BIPV), ground mounted, 7) construction – new or retrofit, 8) heat recovery, 9) insolation maximization – tracking or flat plate, and 10) energy storage – grid connected, electrochemical battery, or micro-hydro using a pre-existing agricultural infrastructure. We find that 1) carbon intensities for best case systems are an order of magnitude lower than coal; 2) carbon intensities for best case and conventionally designed systems are still higher than wind or hydro; 3) significant opportunities exist in further development of solar-grade silicon feedstock, float zone crystal growth rapid thermal processing, and high durability encapsulants; 4) there are significant drawbacks in employing ground-based installations, including 30-50% increases in air pollutant emissions; 5) in many cases, the efficiency gains realized by using tracking devices do not translate into financial or environmental benefits; 6) the emissions from the manufacturing of batteries for stand alone systems are significant, increasing toxic material releases by 100 fold.

In particular polycrystalline Si PV roofing tiles were integrated with concrete roofing tiles in two mounting configurations being used by roofing contractors. In the first configuration the tiles were directly mounted to the roof sheeting allowing little to no airflow under the PV modules. In the second configuration furring strips were attached to the roof deck to create a counter-batten system to which the roofing and PV tiles mount. This counter-batten system provides an air gap between the roof deck and the PV/concrete tiles which allows for convective cooling. A complete data acquisition system was applied to both mounting configurations and they were monitored for a summer period in Golden, Colorado. A performance comparison is presented for the systems while both are gauged against free-standing ack-mounted polycrystalline Si PV modules. As expected, modules mounted directly to the deck operated at higher temperatures and produced less power than those on a counter-batten system while both systems operated at higher temperatures than rack-mounted modules.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Attic; Roof; Deck; Tile; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Furring; Structural engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.2009.5411159,conference article,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,us

In this study, a “double density” simulation scenario is considered where each existing detached house in a community is replaced with two houses of equal living area on the same land lot. The new houses were assumed to be equipped with several energy efficiency measures (envelope, HVAC and domestic hot water) and a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roof. The TRNSYS software was used to simulate the annual energy performance of the buildings in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (45.5°N). It was found that the two new houses, which can accommodate twice the number of people on the same land lot, consumed 35% less energy than the existing house. Individually, each of the new houses required 67% less electricity than the existing house (reduced from 22,560 to 7,350 kWh yr-1). In addition, the BIPV roof installed on the two new houses could generate nearly three times more electricity (43,320 kWh yr-1) than they consumed (14,690 kWh yr-1). Annually, nearly half (47%) of the house’s electricity can be directly supplied by the BIPV system. A significant portion of the annual solar electricity generation (84%), which cannot be directly utilized by the houses, can be stored on-site for later use to increase self-consumption (e.g. power-to-thermal energy or charging electric vehicles) or could be exported to the grid to support decarbonization elsewhere (e.g. production of hydrogen fuel for transportation). The combined effect of energy efficient construction and on-site renewable energy production would enable occupants to shift from consuming 5,640 kWh yr-1 to producing 3,580 kWh yr-1.

1919,071-576-541-517-086,Measured and estimated performance of a fleet of shaded photovoltaic systems with string and module‐level inverters,2017,"Shade obstructions can significantly impact the performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Although there are many models for partially shaded PV arrays, there is a lack of information available regarding their accuracy and uncertainty when compared with actual field performance. This work assesses the recorded performance of 46 residential PV systems, equipped with either string-level or module-level inverters, under a variety of shading conditions. We compare their energy production data to annual PV performance predictions, with a focus on the practical models developed here for National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s SYSTEM ADVISOR MODEL software. This includes assessment of shade extent on each PV system by using traditional onsite surveys and newer 3D obstruction modelling. The electrical impact of shade is modelled by either a nonlinear performance model or assumption of linear impact with shade extent, depending on the inverter type. When applied to the fleet of residential PV systems, performance is predicted with median annual bias errors of 2.5% or less, for systems with up to 20% estimated shading loss. The partial shade models are not found to add appreciable uncertainty to annual predictions of energy production for this fleet of systems but do introduce a monthly root-mean-square error of approximately 4%–9% due to seasonal effects. Use of a detailed 3D model results in similar or improved accuracy over site survey methods, indicating that, with proper description of shade obstructions, modelling of partially shaded PV arrays can be done completely remotely, potentially saving time and cost",Electrical engineering; String (computer science); Rooftop photovoltaic power station; Photovoltaic mounting system; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Photovoltaics; Solar cable,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pip.2884,journal article,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,us
1920,071-695-066-748-548,Measured Performance of Building Integrated Photovoltaic Panels—Round 2,2004,"Architects, building designers, and building owners presently lack sufficient resources for thoroughly evaluating the economic impact of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is addressing this deficiency by evaluating computer models used to predict the electrical performance of BIPV components. To facilitate this evaluation, NIST is collecting long-term BIPV performance data that can be compared against predicted values. The long-term data, in addition, provides insight into the relative merits of different building integrated applications, helps to identify performance differences between cell technologies, and reveals seasonal variations. This paper adds to the slowly growing database of long-term performance data on BIPV components. Results from monitoring eight different building-integrated panels over a 12-month period are summarized. The panels are installed vertically, face true south, and are an integral part of the building's shell. The eight panels comprise the second set of panels evaluated at the NIST test facility. Cell technologies evaluated as part of this second round of testing include single-crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, and two thin film materials: tandem-junction amorphous silicon (2-a-Si) and copper-indium-diselenide (CIS). Two 2-a-Si panels and two CIS panels were monitored. For each pair of BIPV panels, one was insulated on its back side while the back side of the second panel was open to the indoor conditioned space. The panel with the back side thermal insulation experienced higher midday operating temperatures. The higher operating temperatures caused a greater dip in maximum power voltage. The maximum power current increased slightly for the 2-a-Si panel but remained virtually unchanged for the CIS panel. Three of the remaining four test specimens were custom-made panels having the same polycrystalline solar cells but different glazings. Two different polymer materials were tested along with 6 mm-thick, low-iron float glass. The two panels having the much thinner polymer front covers consistently outperformed the panel having the glass front. When compared on an annual basis, the energy production of each polymer-front panel was 8.5% higher than the glass-front panel. Comparison of panels of the same cell technology and comparisons between panels of different cell technologies are made on daily, monthly, and annual bases. Efficiency based on coverage area, which excludes the panel's inactive border, is used for most between panel comparisons. Annual coverage-area conversion efficiencies for the vertically-installed BIPV panels range from a low of 4.6% for the 2-a-Si panels to a high of 12.2% for the two polycrystalline panels having the polymer front covers. The insulated single crystalline panel only slightly outperformed the insulated CIS panel, 10.1% versus 9.7%.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; NIST; Solar cell; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Solar energy; Photovoltaics; Thermal insulation; Structural engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.1883237,journal article,National Institute of Standards and Technology,us
1921,071-873-850-871-856,Sensitivity Factors in Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) System Cost,2003,"Even though PV technology is new and expensive for the building industry today, and regardless of market development and technology advancement, a BIPV system cost can actually be reduced and its application can spread further into the building industry as this paper will manage to show. However, PV systems still have not been accepted by the building industry and consumers yet. According to the results of a survey by the workshop of Building Integrated Photovoltaic for Design Professionals which was sponsored by the National Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA), “a major barrier to analyzing renewable energy systems is assembling and presenting the technical and financial data to persuade a client that a BIPV would make economic sense.” [Wenger and Eiffert, 1996] This paper uses Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) for identifying BIPV system cost components and makes the connection between the findings of LCCA and the design process. It identifies specific quantifiable measures/variables that will be compared with a non-PV integrated building or different PV system applications by using the LCCA method that confirms cost related issues. Calculations of payback period as a result of LCCA gauge the sensitivity of these variables and show how some of them are significantly more important than others in reducing the pay back period. Offering an efficient approach for integration of PV into curtain wall also meets the long-term objective of the satisfaction of the building user.Copyright © 2003 by ASME",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Payback period; Architectural engineering; Renewable energy; Sensitivity (control systems); Curtain wall; Life-cycle cost analysis; Engineering design process; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/isec2003-44231,journal article,Illinois Institute of Technology,us

Any CAC (CAC >0) was present in approximately 51% of the cohort. Both high cfPWV (RR = 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 v 1) and baPVI (RR = 2.9, 3.7. and 4.0 for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 v 1) were associated with the presence of calcification (CAC >0). The association was attenuated but remained significant only for baPVI after adjusting for age, systolic blood pressure, average waist circumference, BMI, fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, hormone replacement therapy, and smoking status. High odds of severe calcification (CAC >100) was seen with the highest quartile of the cfPWV (RR = 5.3) and baPVI (RR = 7.8), and these associations remained significant in multivariable analysis. Conclusions Both cfPWV and baPVI are associated with presence and severity of coronary calcification in overweight postmenopausal women.",Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Cardiology; Arterial stiffness; Waist; Electron beam tomography; Pulse wave velocity; Body mass index; Overweight; Coronary Calcium Score; Medicine; Blood pressure,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjhyper.2006.11.006,journal article,University of Pittsburgh,us
1923,073-312-414-464-982,Smart PV modules — Design considerations,2012,"This paper explores the design of a smart photovoltaic (PV) module- a PV module in which PV cells in close proximity are electrically grouped to form a pixel and are connected to dc-dc converter blocks which reside embedded in the back pane of the module. An auto-connected flyback converter topology processing less than full power is used to provide high gain and perform maximum power point tracking (MPPT). These dc-dc converters interface with cascaded H-bridge inverter modules operating on feed forward control for dc-link voltage ripple rejection. The proposed configuration is capable of producing 120V/ 240V AC voltage. The PV module now becomes a smart AC module by virtue of embedded intelligence to selectively actuate the individual dc-dc converters and control the output AC voltages directly, thus becoming a true plug and power energy system. Such a concept is ideal for curved surfaces such as building integrated PV (BIPV) system applications where gradients of insolation and temperature cause not only variations from PV module-to-PV module but from group-to-group of cells within the module itself. A detailed analysis along with simulation and experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed concept.",Flyback converter; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Power optimizer; Grid-connected photovoltaic power system; Electronic engineering; AC module; Converters; Maximum power point tracking; Photovoltaic system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pedes.2012.6484408,conference article,Texas A&M University,us

1925,075-405-617-110-004,Confined growth with slow surface kinetics: A thin film model approach,2019,"Abstract Recent experimental and theoretical investigations of crystal growth from solution in the vicinity of an impermeable wall have shown that: (i) growth can be maintained within the contact region when a liquid film is present between the crystal and the substrate; (ii) a cavity can form in the center of the contact region due to insufficient supply of mass through the liquid film. Here, we investigate the influence of surface kinetics on these phenomena using a thin film model. First, we determine the growth rate within the confined region in the absence of a cavity. Growth within the contact induces a drift of the crystal away from the substrate. Our results suggest novel strategies to measure surface kinetic coefficients based on the observation of this drift. For the specific case where growth is controlled by surface kinetics outside the contact, we show that the total displacement of the crystal due to the growth in the contact is finite. As a consequence, the growth shape approaches asymptotically the free growth shape truncated by a plane passing through the center of the crystal. Second, we investigate the conditions under which a cavity forms. The critical supersaturation above which the cavity forms is found to be larger for slower surface kinetics. In addition, the critical supersaturation decays as a power law of the contact size. The asymptotic value of the critical supersaturation and the exponent of the decay are found to be different for attractive and repulsive disjoining pressures. Finally, our previous representation of the transition within a morphology diagram appears to be uninformative in the limit of slow surface kinetics.",Displacement (fluid); Kinetics; Chemical physics; Thin film; Materials science; Supersaturation; Crystal growth; Growth rate; Crystal; Power law,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2019.02.022,journal article,University of Lyon,us

To investigate the uniformity of heat extraction from the PV panels, the fluid mechanics of the system are studied separately from the thermal effects.

The operating temperature of BAPV modules can reach as high as 90°C in desert climatic conditions such as Phoenix, Arizona. These high operating temperatures will have a significant impact on the power generation and a dramatic impact on the lifetime of PV modules. The traditional method of minimizing the operating temperature of BAPV modules has been to include a suitable air gap for ventilation between the rooftop and the modules. The previous work at Arizona State University (ASU) was aimed at identifying the effects of various air gaps on the temperature of individual BAPV modules. The goal in this work was to develop a thermal model for a small residential BAPV array consisting of 12 closely packed identical polycrystalline silicon modules at a single air gap of 2.5 inches from the rooftop of 23° tilt with ceramic tiles. The thermal model coefficients for the array are empirically derived from a simulated field test setup at ASU and are presented in this paper. Additionally, this project investigates the effects of cooling the array with a small 40-watt exhaust fan. The fan had only a small effect on power output or efficiency for this 2.5-inch air gap array, but provided slightly lower temperatures (higher lifetime) and better temperature uniformity (higher power output) across the array.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Electrical engineering; Operating temperature; Thermal; Polycrystalline silicon; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Electricity generation; Air gap (plumbing); Temperature measurement; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.2011.6186608,conference article,Arizona State University,us

Experimental prototypes of one-inlet and two-inlet BIPV/T systems were constructed for conducting comparative experiments. Variations of BIPV/T systems are also investigated including systems employing opaque mono-crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) panels and systems employing semi-transparent mono-crystalline PV panels. Experimental results demonstrate that an equivalent two-inlet system with frameless PV panels can increase the thermal efficiency by 5% compared to a conventional one-inlet system, and that the BIPV/T system with semi-transparent PV panels achieves 7.6% higher thermal efficiency due to the absorption of some solar radiation at the bottom surface in the BIPV/T system cavity. Also, the two-inlet BIPV/T design is easily implemented and does not add significant cost. Detailed air temperature measurements reveal that the mixing of the warm outlet air from the first section and the cool ambient air drawn in from the second inlet contributes to the improved performance of the two-inlet system. Based on a thermal network model of the BIPV/T system and experimental data, correlations are developed for the convective heat transfer coefficients in the two sections.

1931,086-089-927-776-212,Identification of Barriers to PV Application Into the Building Design,2003,"Even though there are a number of examples of BIPV, the concept of integration into the building and its design process have not yet been clearly defined. Lack of integration makes this new technology application expensive and very complex to implement. The challenge is how to make this new concept easily applicable and to spread this promising technology for users. In order for PV technology to be added effectively into the design process, full integration is essential. Full integration can be achieved when close interface develops between the PV System and the elements of the building design process. The design process is the spine that links the building from its inception all through its life cycle. The architects, along with the consultants and technical experts, are directly responsible for this process. PV has to be part of the building material and its building material properties have to be equivalent to other conventional building materials. PV has to fit into the building design process from the beginning. As a building component, it has to have certain standards and codes that will fit well within general building codes. This paper starts with the definition of the architectural building design process. It then continues with identifying the barriers that have direct effect on this process. These barriers are lack of interface (integration with typical building process), lack of common language, mismatched potential, unknown performance, and lack of economic analysis. The paper concludes by giving suggestions on how these barriers can be broken.Copyright © 2003 by ASME",Architectural technology; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Building design; Engineering design process; Process (engineering); Design process; Component (UML); Building science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/isec2003-44233,journal article,Illinois Institute of Technology,us

Semi-transparent devices are of great interest due to their attractive application in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). In this study, efficient perovskite solar cells with good transparency in the visible wavelength range have been developed by a facile and low-temperature PCBM-assisted perovskite growth method. This method results in the formation of a perovskite-PCBM hybrid material at the grain boundaries which is observed by EELS mapping and confirmed by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, transient photocurrent (TP) measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PCBM-assisted perovskite growth method involves fewer steps and therefore is less expensive and time consuming than other similar methods. The semitransparent solar cells developed using this method exhibited power conversion efficiency (PCE) ranging from 12% to 4% depending on the average visible transmittance (AVT) ranging from 3% to 35%. The as-fabricated semitransparent perovskite solar cell with an active layer thickness of only about 150 nm, which is only less than half the active layer thickness of a typical perovskite solar cell, provided a PCE as high as 9.1% with an AVT of 18% and more than 12% with an AVT of 3%.",Visible spectrum; Optics; Transmittance; Perovskite (structure); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Materials science; Energy conversion efficiency; Active layer; Perovskite solar cell; Optoelectronics; Photoluminescence,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta04790d,journal article,University of Central Florida,us

This paper presents the life cycle impacts of the Solaire BIPV and extrapolates its performance to other facade systems. Engineering diagrams, detailed material inventories and 5 years of irradiation and actual performance data in 15-min intervals offer insights into current BIPV construction and performance. The Solaire BIPV employs waste-stream monocrystalline silicon wafers. Correspondingly, zero energy input was allocated to this BIPV from wafer production, resulting to a very low energy payback time (EPBT) and global warming potential burden (0.8 years and −10.2 g CO2/kWh, respectively). A negative EPBT results from subtracting the impact of the thermally and structurally equivalent concrete and brick wall that the BIPV array replaced. Data from current photovoltaic-dedicated Si wafer supply were also used; these resulted with an EPBT of 3.8 years and a global warming potential of 61 g CO2/kWh. The performance ratio and EPBT of the Solaire system were compared with those in the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Task 2 inventory database. The drawback of facade BIPV is its vertical orientation, receiving lower incident irradiation than rooftop and ground installations. Nevertheless, BIPV offers two main advantages over such installations: it does not require any ‘virgin’ land for its operation, and it replaces structural units, thus avoiding the cost, embodied energy and corresponding emissions related to those. We detail herein how the replacement of traditional cladding materials can offset the performance drawback of BIPV, in terms of environmental burden and EPBT.

A good optical and thermal characterization of these elements is necessary to assess and compare their performance. The existing testing procedures for glass in buildings are applied to both types of elements, and it is considered that while the optical procedures are suitable and allow good comparison of the two technologies, the indoor thermal testing procedures are not valid for BIPV nor ECSWs, because temperature of these absorbing elements strongly depend on the irradiance, something not considered in the current standards.

Seven plan geometries are studied: square, rectangle, trapezoid, L, U, H and T shapes. The study investigates the effect of these shapes on two major response variables – Solar radiation incident on equatorial-facing facades and transmitted by the fenestration of such facades, and electricity production potential of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) covering roof surfaces with optimal solar exposure. The parameters, whose effects on the response variables are investigated, include, in addition to the basic shapes and roof design, variations to the geometry of L and U shapes and variations to the roof design. Shape variations include varying values of the relative dimensions of shading and shaded facades and variations to the angle enclosed by the wings of these shapes. Variations of roof design consist of modifications to the tilt and side angles of hip roofs. The results indicate that the number of shading facades in-self shading geometries and their relative dimensions are the major parameters affecting solar incident and transmitted radiation. Manipulation of the orientation of wings in L shape units can result in increased peak electricity generation potential, and in shifting the timing of the peak by up to 2 h either side of solar noon. The shift of peak load may be economically beneficial, facilitating more even distribution of electricity production over an assemblage of buildings.

In this perspective, we assess the case for market deployment of BIPV windows, specifically intended for commercial U.S. high-rise buildings. Research and development on solar powered windows has been predicated on the hypothesis that sunlight-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device cost per unit area are the key figures of merit that might drive market adoption. Here we investigate the market landscape and desirability for solar powered windows by identifying and evaluating the customer needs for the commercial high-rise building window market. In the course of this assessment, we performed 150 interviews with experts across the value chain for commercial windows. We found that the market forces are complicated by a misalignment of incentives between the end users of BIPV windows and the key decision makers for building projects that could incorporate this technology. Our assessment leads us to frame new figures of merit for BIPV windows that address the underlying needs of prospective customers as well as technical metrics for energy generation.

BIPV surfaces can operate on roofs and facades and their efficiency and productivity are related to orientation, shading, reflections from surrounding surfaces. The novelty of the present investigation relies on a chained model also able to account for the Urban Heat Island conditions. The building performance are analysed as EnergyPlus simulations, considering a multi thermal zone reference building located inside a district of similar characteristics. The PV power generation, from hourly to yearly values, is calculated accounting for PV module temperature, irradiance intensity and solar incident angles, by further developing the well known Sandia model. The whole model, applied to a particular city (41.9°N, 12.5°E), shows how the progressive increase of vertical PV surfaces on both the reference and surrounding buildings yields to a reduction of the energy production per PV unit area. The yearly NZED requirements is reached, in the present case, harvesting solar energy on 60% of rooftops and on 60% of the total area of the facades, with a 11% decrease in energy production per PV unit area due to ""darkening"" effects induced by PV surrounding buildings.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Reduction (mathematics); Meteorology; Zero-energy building; Thermal; Environmental science; Irradiance; Urban heat island; Solar energy; Intensity (heat transfer),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.07.057,journal article,University of Genoa,us

The achievable consumptions and the most influential parameters such as glazing U-value, VT/SHGC and shading and their optimal values were investigated. The study has been carried out for a theoretical office building in Italy and Lithuania, representatively of a southern and northern EU climate. The building chosen is representative of all the glazed-simple shape buildings and the analysis of the entirety of the building enables a clear and im-mediate outcome of global consumptions. Number of DesignBuilder simulations were performed and the annual consumptions are summed with the primary energy criteria. Results show the critical aspects of 100% WWR buildings: in the coldest climate the main problem is the huge surface of relatively high glass U-value compared with standard walls, while in the warmer one the main efforts need to be done to avoid the summer overheating caused by incoming solar radiation. Finally, it is shown that it is difficult to lower the overall primary energy consumptions below 130 and 140 kWh/m2a for North-Italy and Lithuania locations respectively.

Thus, in the short and medium term, there is a need for a BIPV mounting system that utilizes conventional modules. Such a design is provided here with a novel modification of conventional photovoltaic (PV) modules to allow them to act as BIPV roofing slates. The open-source designs for the mechanical components necessary to provide the post-consumer conversion for a conventional PV module are provided, and prototypes are fabricated and installed on a mock roof system along with control modules mounted conventionally. The approximately U.S.$22/module BIPV roof-mounted system is direct mounted on the roof to eliminate the need for roofing shingles or other coverings, which effectively provides a 20% total cost reduction from conventional racking systems that demand a roof to mount upon without considering the savings from the rack itself.

However, a key challenge is their lack of stability over prolonged solar irradiation. Few studies have investigated the effect of light soaking on hybrid perovskites and have attributed the degradation in the optoelectronic properties to photochemical or field-assisted ion migration. Here we show that the slow photocurrent degradation in thin-film photovoltaic devices is due to the formation of light-activated meta-stable deep-level trap states. However, the devices can self-heal completely by resting them in the dark for <1 min or the degradation can be completely prevented by operating the devices at 0 °C. We investigate several physical mechanisms to explain the microscopic origin for the formation of these trap states, among which the creation of small polaronic states involving localized cooperative lattice strain and molecular orientations emerges as a credible microscopic mechanism requiring further detailed studies.",Irradiation; Degradation (geology); Perovskite (structure); Materials science; Self-healing; Photocurrent; Photovoltaic system; Optoelectronics; Hybrid solar cell; Polaron,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11574,journal article,Los Alamos National Laboratory,us

This paper extends analysis to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both man-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven PV materials covering three common PV system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications. An effective albedo is found for each surface material and PV material combination, which can be used in lieu of broadband albedo values in PV simulations. These results enable PV material selection for specific environments enabling geographic optimization for the micro-environment, while at the same time assisting optimal surface selection in the vicinity of existing or planned PV arrays.

To this aim, a series of vertical heaters are cooled by natural convection of air flowing between two parallel walls. The objective of the work is to investigate the physical mechanisms which influence the thermal behaviour of a double-skin photovoltaic (PV) facade. This results in a better understanding of the related phenomena and infers useful engineering information for controlling the energy transfers from the environment to the PV surfaces and from the PV surfaces to the building. Furthermore increasing the heat transfer rate from the PV surfaces increases the conversion efficiency of the PV modules since they operate better as their temperature is lower. The test section consists in a double vertical wall, 2 m high, and each wall is constituted by 10 different heating modules 0.2 m high. The heater arrangement simulates, at a reduced scale, the presence of a series of vertical PV modules. The heat flux at the wall ranges from 75 to 200 W/m{sup 2}. In this study, the heated section is 1.6 m inmore » height, preceded by an adiabatic of 0.4 m in height. Different heating configurations are analyzed, including the uniform heating mode and two different configurations of non uniform, alternate heating. The experimental procedure allows the wall surface temperature, local heat transfer coefficient and local and average Nusselt numbers to be inferred.

One promising application for select organic scintillators is in lowcost, portable, and durable dual-particle imaging (DPI) systems to support nuclear safety, security, and safeguards purposes. All candidate materials should first undergo investigation utilizing industry standards to quantify and evaluate their capabilities. In this work, a 21% bismuth-loaded polyvinyl toluene (BiPVT) fabricated by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was computationally and experimentally evaluated as a small, pixelated radiographic array, with individual pixel dimensions of 2×2×19 mm. For comparison, the same evaluations were conducted for two samesized arrays made from EJ-200 and EJ-256. ASTM standard test methods and practices were utilized to calculate the modulation transfer function and basic spatial resolution for each array, both from measured and simulated data. Measurements were recorded by pressure coupling all three arrays to a commercial a-Si digital radiographic panel, and the computational model replicated the experimental design. Computational and experimental results were compared for all three arrays in the x-ray environment, whereas only computational results are available at this time for comparison in a fast neutron environment. The x-ray results demonstrate that BiPVT outperformed nearly identical arrays made from EJ- 200 and EJ-256, and the agreement between the simulated and experimental x-ray results validates the applied computational methodology for comparative predictions of neutron performance. Based on these simulations, the BiPVT array is also expected to outperform arrays made from EJ-200 and EJ-256 in fast neutron environments.

We focus on state clean energy funds, which have been established in 14 U.S. states to build markets for clean energy resources, as well as a select number of other state or local organizations whose activities are particularly noteworthy. We describe the types of programs implemented and their impacts to date, and discuss key issues and lessons learned for initiatives aimed at growing the new home market for PV. feature in new developments offers an opportunity to circumvent the high transaction costs and other barriers typically confronted when each individual homeowner must make a distinct PV purchase decision. Along with its unique advantages, the market for PV on new homes also faces significant challenges. Most fundamentally, perhaps, is the general aversion to technology risk within the building industry, particularly in “hot” housing markets. Builders also have specific reservations about PV related to its impact on home prices and profits, potential project delays, and a perceived lack of homebuyer interest. Furthermore, many builders may not recognize or fully value the potential benefits that PV offers for their business, including greater market differentiation, enhanced media exposure, and less community or political opposition to development projects. Recognizing its potential, various initiatives have been launched in the U.S. to support the growth of the new home market for PV, including programs to promote zero-energy homes (ZEH) and, most recently, a proposal in California for a 10-year, $350 million program aimed specifically at PV in new homes. In addition to these high-profile initiatives, various organizations throughout the U.S. – at the local, state, and federal levels – have undertaken important efforts to encourage PV in new homes. In particular, clean energy funds, currently established in 14 U.S. states and with more than $5 billion to invest in renewable energy over the next decade, have emerged as leaders in these efforts. 2 1. INTRODUCTION As a market segment for PV adoption, new homes have a number of attractive attributes. Homebuyers can easily roll the cost of the PV system into their mortgage and, with rebates or other financial incentives, potentially realize an immediate net positive cash flow from the investment. PV system performance can be optimized by taking roof orientation, shading, and other structural factors into account in the design of new homes. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which are subject to fewer aesthetic concerns than traditional, rack-mounted systems, are well- suited to new construction applications. 1 In large new residential developments, costs can be reduced through bulk purchases and scale economies in system design and installation.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations can be a valuable tool for the design and analysis of these hybrid building-integrated solar energy systems while recent advances in CFD approaches and turbulence models provide a great potential for improving prediction accuracy. This study performs 3-dimensional steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations and evaluates the performance of five turbulence closure models, potentially suitable for modeling UTCs in terms of accuracy and computing cost. These models include four two-equation models (Standard k-ɛ, Renormalization Group Methods k-ɛ, Realizable k-ɛ and Shear Stress Transport k-ω) and one Reynolds Stress Model. A flat UTC under free stream approaching flow conditions and a corrugated UTC subjected to a plane wall jet flow were considered. The predicted air velocity, air temperature, and turbulent kinetic energy were compared against experimental data from the literature and those obtained using a specially designed full-scale experimental set-up in a solar simulator. The results show that although the Reynolds Stress Model can provide more detailed flow features at an increased computational cost compared to other models, it does not necessarily result in better performance. Among the two- equation models, the Renormalization Group Methods k-ɛ has the best overall performance for both cases studied while the Standard k- ɛ and Shear Stress Transport k-ω models can also provide acceptable prediction accuracy. A BIPV/T system with two PV panel arrangements across a UTC under the same coverage was investigated using the CFD models developed in the present study. It was found that BIPV/T systems integrated with UTCs can result in electrical efficiency up to 1.2% higher, for the cases considered.",Airflow; Engineering; Reynolds stress; Reynolds stress equation model; Turbulence kinetic energy; Computational fluid dynamics; Turbulence; Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations; Heat transfer; Mechanics; Mechanical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2012.11.115,journal article,Purdue University,us

As a key component of the multifunctional building envelope, an aluminum/high-density polyethylene (HDPE) functionally graded material (FGM) panel embedded with aluminum water tubes has been fabricated through the vibration-sedimentation approach. The FGM layer gradually transits material phases from well-conductive side (with aluminum dominated) to another highly insulated side (with HDPE). The heat in the PV cells can be easily transferred into the conductive side of the FGM and then collected by the water flow in the embedded tubes. Therefore, the operational temperature of the PV cells can be significantly lowered down, which recovers the PV efficiency in hot weather. In this way, the developed BIPVT panel is able to efficiently harvest solar energy in the form of both PV electricity and heat. The performance of a prototype BIPVT panel has been evaluated in terms of its thermal efficiency via warm water collection and PV efficiency via the output electricity. The laboratory test results demonstrate that significant energy conversion efficiency improvement can be achieved for both electricity generation and heat collection by the presented BIPVT roofing system.

Large commercial building envelopes can be utilized due to their great potential of reducing building energy consumption and increasing PV integration impact, especially in climate zones with rich solar resources. Most current studies have been focused on predicting electricity generation of BIPV systems with existing envelope geometries, while few studies have discussed the generation of proper envelope shapes for PV integration due to the challenge of integrating architecture and engineering. This paper introduces a novel optimization method for BIPV shape development based on the shape grammar theory. The method reforms given building shapes/envelopes to produce a set of better BIPV shape alternatives, as well as determines the best placement and matching BIPV systems for the optimized envelopes. The main set of criteria considered during the generation and optimization process include PV power generation, PV economic impact and building energy consumption. Architectural preferences are included in generating preferred design alternatives, such as view consideration and shape direction.

1961,126-939-262-598-18X,Measured Performance of Building Integrated Photovoltaic Panels: Round 2,2004,"Architects, building designers, and building owners presently lack sufficient resources for thoroughly evaluating the economic impact of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is addressing this deficiency by evaluating computer models used to predict the electrical performance of BIPV components. To facilitate this evaluation, NIST is collecting long-term BIPV performance data that can be compared against predicted values. The long-term data, in addition, provides insight into the relative merits of different building integrated applications, helps to identify performance differences between cell technologies, and reveals seasonal variations. This paper adds to the slowly growing database of longterm performance data on BIPV components. Results from monitoring eight different building-integrated panels over a twelve-month period are summarized. The panels are installed vertically, face true-south, and are an integral part of the building’s shell. The eight panels comprise the second set of panels evaluated at the NIST test facility. Cell technologies evaluated as part of this second round of testing include single crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, and two thin film materials: tandem-junction amorphous silicon (2-a-Si) and copper-indium-diselenide (CIS). Two 2-a-Si panels and two CIS panels were monitored. For each pair of BIPV panels, one was insulated on its backside while the backside of the second panel was open to the indoor conditioned space. The panel with the backside thermal insulation experienced higher midday operating temperatures. The higher operating temperatures caused a greater dip in maximum power voltage. The maximum power current increased slightly for the 2-a-Si panel but remained virtually unchanged for the CIS panel. Three of the remaining four test specimens were custom-made panels having the same polycrystalline solar cells but different glazings. Two different polymer materials, Tefzel and Kynar, were tested along with 6 mm-thick, low-iron float glass. The two panels having the much thinner polymer front covers consistently outperformed the panel having the glass front. When compared on an annual basis, the energy production of each polymer-front panel was 8.5% higher than the glass-front panel. Comparison of panels of the same cell technology and comparisons between panels of different cell technologies are made on daily, monthly, and annual bases. Efficiency based on coverage area, which excludes the panel’s inactive border, is used for most “between” panel comparisons.

Building-integrated photovoltaics,1996,"The author describes how the market for building-integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) could be enormous, and many companies are beginning to develop and commercialize specialized BIPV components and systems. Residential and commercial demand will probably be the nearest-term large-scale markets in developed countries. Homes and commercial buildings have a lot of surface area, allowing architects and system designers to displace the cost of conventional materials and labor onto photovoltaic substitutes. Moreover, BIPV produce power at the point of use, eliminating much of the cost and losses of its transmission and distribution. Finally, a building powered in this way trumpets its owners' environmental philosophy and commitment to the world at large. As the technology has moved out of the research laboratory and into commercial applications involving architects and building engineers, it has assumed a progressively more sophisticated, elegant and appropriate shape. BIPV components that take the place of conventional building materials become part of the form and esthetic of the structure, as well as part of a more sustainable future for their owners, for their communities, and for society in general.",Environmental philosophy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Engineering; Architectural engineering; Power (social and political); Photovoltaic system; Energy conservation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/6.540090,journal article,Harvard University,us

This house, with a design goal of near net-zero annual energy consumption, was constructed in 2007 in Eastman, Quebec, Canada – a cold climate area. Several novel solar technologies are integrated into the house and with passive solar design to reach this goal. An air-based open-loop BIPV/T system produces electricity and collects heat simultaneously. Building-integrated thermal mass is utilized both in passive and active forms. Distributed thermal mass in the direct gain area and relatively large south facing triple-glazed windows (about 9% of floor area) are employed to collect and store passive solar gains. An active thermal energy storage system (TES) stores part of the collected thermal energy from the BIPV/T system, thus reducing the energy consumption of the house ground source heat pump heating system. This paper focuses on the BIPV/T system and the integrated energy concept of the house. Monitored data indicate that the BIPV/T system has a typical efficiency of about 20% for thermal energy collection, and the annual space heating energy consumption of the house is about 5% of the national average. A thermal model of the BIPV/T system suitable for preliminary design and control of the airflow is developed and verified with monitored data.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Thermal mass; Passive solar building design; Meteorology; Automotive engineering; Thermal energy storage; Heating system; Environmental science; Solar energy; Low-energy house,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2010.06.013,journal article,Concordia University Wisconsin,us

Previous work has explored the use of photovoltaics in specific residential sites in rural areas for providing the electricity needs of the residential complex [1]. However, the opportunity of employing building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and energy efficient building designs for meeting the energy needs of representative residential buildings in urban areas has not been previously investigated. This paper provides a study of the use of BIPV methods for residential sector retrofit in three major urban cities in Egypt. This study assesses the life cycle costs and energy efficiency impacts of harnessing solar energy for use in residential buildings. The paper draws upon and further develops other research done in the field by analyzing energy savings and impacts of BIPV in different demographic and geographical settings for a representative building model type in an urban setting. Two benchmark building performance simulation models were used that reflect the average energy consumption characteristics of air-conditioned residential apartments in Cairo, Alexandria, and Asyut [2].

1967,135-616-204-460-676,Optimization of passive solar design and integration of building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) system in northern housing,2021,"In the Canadian north, the cost of space heating is very high due to the harsh weather, its remoteness, lack of transportation, and dependency on the high cost of fossil fuel imported from the South. Since the North has an abundance of solar energy, significant energy savings with some added construction cost in houses could be achieved by applying high-performance building envelopes and solar design strategies. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of both passive and active solar design strategies in improving the energy efficiency of northern housing. Firstly, a reference house representing a typical single-family home in the North is modeled using EnergyPlus, and the key passive design parameters are optimized to minimize life-cycle cost. Then, the air-based building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) system is applied to the optimized house and integrated with HVAC systems. It is found that optimal passive solar design can reduce the heating energy demand by 42% with an incremental cost of 8% for Yellowknife and by 27% without incurring an incremental cost for Kuujjuaq. Integrating BIPV/T with HVAC systems can reduce the defrost time of heat recovery ventilator (HRV), extend the working hours and improve the COP of air source heat pump (ASHP). The reduction in the total energy consumption is in the range of 1.4%–3.0% by integrating HRV and 0.3%–0.6% by integrating ASHP due to the mis-match of solar availability and heating energy demand. To maximize the utilization of solar energy available, the optimal use of thermal energy recovered from BIPV/T system in northern housing requires further investigation.",Thermal energy; Building-integrated photovoltaics; HVAC; Passive solar building design; Automotive engineering; Efficient energy use; Active solar; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/986202/,journal article,Concordia University,us

In this work, it is considered that the electricity requirement of the building is provided by the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system and the gap between the energy demand and BIPV supply is fulfilled by the FC. The FC is powered by the electrolytic H2 produced from the surplus power of PV. A design study of using the proposed system in five cities in Mie prefecture, which are in center part of Japan, has been performed.

The BIPV/T system absorbs solar energy on the top surface, which includes the photovoltaic panels and generates electricity while also heating air drawn by a variable speed fan through a channel formed by the top roof surface with the photovoltaic modules and an insulated attic layer. The BIPV/T system channel has a length/hydraulic diameter ratio of 38, which is representative of a BIPV/T roof system for 30-45 deg tilt angles. Because of the heating asymmetry in the BIPV/T channel, two average Nusselt number correlations are reported as a function of Reynolds number: one for the top heated surface and the other for the bottom surface. For the top heated surface, the Nusselt number is in the range of 6-48 for Reynolds numbers ranging from 250 to 7500. For the bottom insulated surface, the Nusselt number is in the range of 22-68 for Reynolds numbers ranging from 800 to 7060. This paper presents correlations for the average Nusselt number as a function of Reynolds number; this correlation is considered adequate for the design of BIPV/T systems where forced convection dominates.

The review showed that the majority of experimental studies involve small-scale PV/T prototypes of the stand-alone format, usually tested under conditions that are not representative of full-scale BIPV/T systems, while the cases of instrumented full-scale BIPV/T systems are very few. The varying testing conditions render a direct performance comparison of the various systems difficult, while the convective phenomena may exhibit significantly different behavior depending on the system type and size. Additionally, different expressions used to model wind-driven and channel convection may introduce significant uncertainty in the predicted performance of such systems. These inconsistencies in both the monitored and modelled performance contribute to a reduced confidence in such systems and a resulting small number of realized applications.

1976,162-615-847-152-102,BAPV modules: Installed-NOCT and temperature coefficients after 1-year exposure,2011,"Building applied photovoltaics (BAPV) is one of the major applications for photovoltaic (PV) modules. The performance of PV modules is heavily influenced by their operating temperature; for example, the power of crystalline silicon drops at a rate of about 0.5%/°C. The operating temperature is primarily dictated by three major parameters: ambient temperature, irradiance and wind speed. The magnitude of the influence of these parameters depends on the type of installation: open-rack or building-applied. Recognizing these issues, the design qualification standard of PV modules, IEC 61215, requires reporting NOCT (nominal operating cell temperature) values for the open-rack but not for the BAPV modules. This paper deals with the NOCT determination of BAPV modules, herein called installed-NOCT (INOCT). The effect of air gap (between module and rooftop) on INOCT values is also quantitatively determined in this work. The INOCT values determined for different air gaps (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4-inch) using the conventional thermal model of IEC 61215 are also compared with the values determined using the BAPV thermal model previously developed by Arizona State University. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed that the temperature coefficients of PV modules do not change over time in the field and all the energy yield calculations are performed based on the temperature coefficients of fresh modules. This work investigates if this assumption is accurate or not, through the determination of temperature coefficients of 14 modules before and after 1-year of rooftop exposure.",Nuclear engineering; Electrical engineering; Operating temperature; Wind speed; Crystalline silicon; Environmental science; Photovoltaic system; Irradiance; Air gap (plumbing); Photovoltaics; Temperature measurement,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/pvsc.2011.6186083,conference article,Arizona State University,us

A louver-type PV-integrated shading device was suggested and an artificial neural networks (ANN) model was developed to predict PV electricity output, work plane illuminance, and daylight glare index (DGI). The slat tilt angle of the shading device was controlled to maximize PV electricity output based on three different strategies: one without visual comfort constraints, and the other two with visual comfort constraints: work plane illuminance and DGI. Optimal tilt angle was calculated using predictions of the ANN. Experiments were conducted to verify the system modeling and to evaluate the performance of the shading device. Experiment results revealed that the ANN model successfully predicted the PV output, work plane illuminance, and DGI. The PV-integrated shading device was more efficient in producing electricity than the conventional wall-mount PV systems, the control method without visual comfort constraints was most efficient in generating electricity than the other two with such constraints, and excluding the constraints resulted in less comfortable visual environment and reduced energy benefit.

Both the configurations operate in two modes, namely heating and cooling modes. In the heating mode of the configuration A, the cold outdoor air is twice preheated by passing through the EAHE and BIPVT systems. In the cooling mode of the configuration A, the hot outdoor air is precooled by flowing inside the EAHE system and the PV modules are cooled using the building exhaust air. The cooling mode of the configuration B is similar to the configuration A, while in the heating mode of the configuration B, the outdoor air first enters the BIPVT collector and then passes through the EAHE system. The energetic and exergetic performances of the configurations are investigated for climatic conditions of Kermanshah, Iran.

Analyzing the application of PV roof on large space structure system, this paper points out that key points of application of this technology are PV cells and roof bearing body. Besides, the discussion of what is important in structure design of PV roof shows that the calculation of Building-attached Photovoltaic roof (BAPV roof) should consider the influence of load applied on the windward side and leeward side, the synergic action of panels and supporting frames and whipping effect; while the calculation of Building-Integrated Photovoltaic roof (BIPV roof) should put bearing load on the first place and satisfy insulation work as well as waterproof work of roof.

1989,042-652-547-777-17X,WEB-BASED DECISION SUPPORT TOOL FOR BUILDING-INTEGRATED SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS,2020,"Abstract. A web-based multi-criteria decision support tool is designed to support the planning, control and deployment of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) in the City of Cape Town, South Africa. Solar energy is one of the renewable sources for generating electricity by means of photovoltaic systems, and it offers a viable and expedient means of generating electricity within a short period of time. Nevertheless, there are some impediments to the extensive deployment of solar photovoltaic systems. The most prominent among these are generation potential and the high capital cost of initial set-up. Hence, the location, design and yield of building-integrated photovoltaic systems have to be well thought-out before their deployment. The interactive web-based tool designed utilises JavaScript and Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) to implement a map mashup, which can be queried to retrieve vital information about the solar photovoltaic potential of a building roof. From results generated and the system developed, it becomes possible to remotely and sufficiently evaluate buildings in the city in order to make decisions about solar photovoltaic potentials, designs and installations.",Software deployment; Decision support system; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Web application; Renewable energy; Mashup; Systems engineering; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-v-4-2020-109-2020,journal article,University of Cape Town,za

The system, located on the north facing roof, started generating electrical power in February 2009. In addition to providing electrical energy, the photovoltaic panels also act as the building roofing material. An instrumentation and data acquisition system was installed to record the indoor and outdoor ambient temperature, indoor and outdoor relative humidity, wind speed and direction, solar irradiance, electrical energy produced by the solar panels and the household energy consumption.

1991,062-072-037-624-450,Implementing building integrated photovoltaics in the housing sector in South Africa,2013,"The installation of Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has been increasing rapidly throughout the world, yet little, if at all, has been reported in South Africa. The country has abundant solar energy resource estimated to be between 4.5 and 6.5 kWh/m2/day, yet solar energy contributes less than 1% to the country’s energy mix. More than 90% of the country’s primary energy comes from fossil fuels leading to an unsustainable per capita carbon footprint of about 9 tCO2e. Previous research has shown that photovoltaics can significantly augment the constrained fossil fuel generated electricity supply. This paper discusses the practical application of photovoltaics as a building element in energy efficient residential housing. The study also aims to determine the feasibility of implementing BIPV systems in the residential sector in South Africa. An energy efficient solar house was designed using simulation software and constructed. Ordinary solar panels were integrated onto the north facing roof of the house. A data acquisition system that monitors meteorological conditions and BIPV output was installed. It was observed that elevated back of module temperatures reaching up to 75°C on sunny days decreased module efficiency by up to 20% in the afternoon. The temperature profiles reveal that BIPV products can significantly influence indoor heating and cooling loads. The research seeks to raise awareness among housing stakeholders and solar industry policy makers of the feasibility of BIPV in South Africa.",Building-integrated photovoltaics; Primary energy; Engineering; Environmental economics; Mains electricity; Efficient energy use; Energy mix; Carbon footprint; Solar energy; Photovoltaics; Environmental engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2413-3051/2013/v24i2a3133,journal article,University of Fort Hare,za
1992,095-298-252-765-191,Optimization of PV model using fuzzy-neural network for DC-DC converter systems,2018,"Due to the large demand for energy, energy sources, as well as the problems of the environment such as the dynamic weather conditions. Hence the world researchers nowadays are moving toward using solar energy because it gives different advantages over the traditional energy sources such as low maintenance costs, eternal sun energy, and the lack of revival of the gases of green houses. As a result, the photo-voltaic (PV) systems' power will be reduced. Under different weather conditions, maximizing the power point tracking (MPPT) is an important part to improve the solar systems power. In this paper, we introduce the neural network approaches for the PV systems. This paper also presents a novel application of Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) in modeling a PV. The photovoltaic system model is designed with the use of MATLAB/SIMULINK software program with the connection of a DC-DC boost converter, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller, a one-phase Voltage Source Converter (VSC) and a three-level bridge. The MPPT controller is used to cover the need for advanced controller that can detect the maximum power point in solar cell systems that have unstable current and voltage and keep the resultant power per cost low.",Maximum power principle; Voltage source; Energy source; Maximum power point tracking; Computer science; Photovoltaic system; Solar energy; Control theory; Boost converter; Control theory,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/irec.2018.8362552,conference article,University of Johannesburg,za
