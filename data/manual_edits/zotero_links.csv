The monthly average daily solar radiation on a horizontal surface and the daily sum distributions of solar radiation show that the solar radiation intensity is quite high in Hong Kong except the wet period from January to March. The mean annual global radiation is 4646.8 MJ/m/sup 2/. The potential electricity generating capacity from BIPV systems is estimated to be 10.5 TWh which is about 35% of the total annual electricity supply (29.9 TWh) in Hong Kong in 1995 if the shadow facades of the high-rise buildings are excluded. The BIPV electricity prices are estimated and compared with the local grid electricity prices.

4PC6NSSY,journalArticle,2005,"Zhang, Zhengyang","The Chinese Renewable Energy Law and BIPV's Introduction, Application and Development in China",,,,,http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1327642,"This paper reviews building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications in China as one pathway toward diversification of the Chinese energy infrastructure. By analysing the potential of BIPV's penetration in Chinese urban areas and a scenario analysis in Beijing, this paper addresses the questions (1) Is BIPV feasible in China? (2) If the Chinese government chooses BIPV, what are the pros and cons? (3) How can obstacles be overcome to implement BIPV? In terms of current PV technology, a 5 kWp PV system occupying about 40 m2 rooftop area can produce c.a. 6 MWh electricity per year under average insolation levels in China. Given an approximate rooftop area in townships of roughly 4 billion m2 in 2003, installation of PV systems on just one third of these rooftops would enable annual generation of approximately 200 TWh. This represents 14% of Chinese annual electricity consumption in 2002 for BIPV or rooftop systems alone, independent of large concentrated solar facilities such as PV power plants. BIPV remains in its infancy or as a novelty in Chinese cities as demonstration projects and the potential of PV energy is far from full commercial exploitation. Globally, manufacturing capacity for PV cells recently exceeded 1 GW and the fastest increment of PV is the grid-connected PV system in residential rooftops, namely, BIPV in most cases. The Chinese Renewable Energy Law (CREL) is a landmark of Chinese government's endeavour to construct a harmonic society and transition to sustainable patterns of development. It supports a reduction in consumption of fossil fuels and seeks to stimulate renewable alternatives. Aiming for the enhancement of CREL this paper also analyses the background, contents and limitations of this law. Correlative recommendations for further improvement are given based on successful cases in other countries. To promote the rooftop programme of BIPV, economic incentives are discussed by adapting the German Feed-in Tariff to a scenario of a ?100 000 Rooftop Programme? in Beijing, China. Quantitative analysis of application of BIPV technology in Beijing as a sample case shows it is feasible in China. The environmental, social and economical benefits show BIPV should be developed in priority among all the renewables in Chinese cities. Finally, several suggestions on actions are given for policy-makers.",2005,20.07.21 15:38,20.07.21 15:38,20.07.21 15:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eng,info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess,,,,lup.lub.lu.se,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/TNU6C9FA/Zhang - 2005 - The Chinese Renewable Energy Law and BIPV's Introd.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/RALQ2UYY/1327642.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The avoided use of comparably priced alternatives such as polished stone in commercial facades enables PV to be applied often at no additional cost. The use of semi-transparent PV modules within commercial atria represents an interesting application in this respect. However, compared to standard double glazing an element incorporating mono-crystalline PV cells in a glass-glass construction comes at a cost premium. To justify such an application there must be significant added value in the PV solution. This paper critically appraises a semi-transparent PV atrium which has been used to link two buildings at Southampton University. The PV atrium encloses the main campus reception desk and performs multiple functions, which have direct and indirect benefits for the building users and the wider University: electricity generation, solar protection, environmental and technology statements for the building and the University, enhanced comfort and prestige of the office workspace. A comparison of alternative shading solutions for the atrium combined with evaluation of user’s perception of the building / atrium and its impact on their personal workspace has been undertaken. It is shown that PV in commercial atria does not always have to be considered as a ‘luxury’ option and with appropriate consideration of these added value factors, its selection justified.",2006-04,20.07.21 15:38,20.07.21 15:38,20.07.21 15:38,273-278,,,,,,,,,,,REMIC,,,,,,,eprints.soton.ac.uk,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/Z282MPXE/53815.html,,,,,,,"Bahaj, A.

The BIPV will occupy an area of 170 m{sup 2}, and will encompass the south-facing modules of an atrium skylight saw-tooth. Installed capacity of the system will be 23 kWp. The tilt angle of the south-facing part of the skylight will be 30 degrees. Real time monitoring and display of the energy provided by the BIPV is expected to provide feedback for the researchers and allow the public to gain a better understanding of its operation. The BIPV was designed to be a net producer of energy for the centre and is one of several clean energy strategies that will be used to ensure that the centre remains carbon neutral. The design of the PV system and its overall transparently will ensure that the centre uses 100 per cent daylighting. Rainwater will also be collected on the PV surfaces. The BIPV will be monitored as part of a research program developing anticipatory-predictive control algorithms for solar-optimized buildings, and was designed to be accessible to the public.

8JSEFK8V,conferencePaper,2008,"Noguchi, Masa",BIPV Education Initiative the Mackintosh School of Architecture,,,,,http://radar.gsa.ac.uk/1275/,"The implementation of the Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) has the great potential to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) that considerably contributes to global warming, when building comes into operation. Moreover, buildings, where PV cells are well integrated, also provide non-economic benefits including the visual value of green architecture that helps gain the market acceptance. The needs for PV education at the schools of architecture, which generally train and generate future architects, are on the rise and the know-how to implement BIPV should be taught sufficiently at the design schools in response to societal needs for the 21st century architecture. Over the past ten years, the Mackintosh School of Architecture (Mac), which belongs to the Glasgow School of Art, has noted the embracing of ‘environmental sustainability’ in architecture as a core precept in the profession, as well as the education. In fact, in line with green building materials and systems that improve the energy-efficiency in building envelope, BIPV is well introduced to the undergraduate design studio course, as well as the postgraduate studies of energy and environment. In addition to the traditional lecture inputs, the architecture students are also invited to participate in the learning activities outside lecture theatres, such as a BIPV construction site excursion and design charrette, in order to guide the non-technical architecture students to thorough understanding of BIPV through experience.  The ‘excursion’ involves a new setting, where students can actually experience subjects in question. As well, this provides an opportunity for reflective dialogue between teacher and learners and among learners. On 3rd-5th September, 2007, the Mac organised the PV Zero-carbon Mass Custom Home Mission to Japan, where 18 delegates from the government, industry and academia from the UK, France and China joined and 2 architecture students at the Mac are also among them. The participants visited not only the state-of-the-art production and sales facilities of 5 leading PV solar housing manufacturers in Japan—Sekisui Chemical Co., Misawa Homes Co., PanaHome Corp., SANYO Homes Co., and Sekisui House Ltd. <http://www.cbe.org.uk/news/index.html>. As well, the mission was also extended to the visit to a new solar housing community that is composed of total 120 homes equipped with PV systems—i.e. PV solar mass customised housing community.  The design charrette was held at the former YMCA lodge in Wiston in March 2007, and provided the students with an interdisciplinary learning experience, where the environmental engineering and architecture students work as a team to actually design the lodge’s new bunkhouse that needs to be energy-efficient in response to the owners’ demands. Five design teams were organised and assigned to produce their own solar solutions. This design exercises took on a new sense of reality. Because of this transition, or simply chance, a scheme manifested itself over the weekend and it was not only practical to build, but also serene in terms of design and contextuality. All the multi-disciplinary teams have identical briefs, but each team is allowed to select their own site within the vicinity of the lodge. In the charrette, students are also given opportunities to experience user-friendly simulation tools that help identify PV performance in relation to the solar panel orientation and tilt under specified climatic conditions. The charrette creates a stimulative learning environment, where architecture students together with the engineering experience the implementation of BIPV. This paper aims to identify architecture students’ learning activities of BIPV that is rarely taught at design schools in the UK today. The analysis of the learning processes and outcomes of the BIPV educational initiative at the Mac may help other schools to develop new courses that aim to enhance the future architects’ readiness to apply BIPV to the 21st century architecture that is expected to be zero-energy, or perhaps carbon-neutral.",02.04.08,20.07.21 15:40,20.07.21 15:40,20.07.21 15:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bath, United Kingdom",,,,,,radar.gsa.ac.uk,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/XZZ8N2VM/1275.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"UK-ISES 4th Photovoltaic Science, Applications and Technology Conference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has the additional benefit of cooling the photovoltaic panels, consequently improving their efficiency. For open loop BIPV/T air systems, although the air is considerably heated, its temperature often remains too low for direct use in building space heating applications. However, it is usually adequate to serve as the source of a heat pump. This paper presents the results of a simulation used as a decision-making tool in the system configuration design and the selection of the heat pump model to be coupled to the BIPV/T roof of a net-zero energy house.

A model roof  was constructed using triple-junction amorphous (3a-Si) PV on one section and  conventional roofing tiles on the other. The performance of the PV module and tiles  were measured, over a range of ambient temperatures and solar irradiance. PVSyst (a  computer design software) was used to determine the most appropriate angle of tilt.  It  was observed that 3a-Si performs well in conditions such as Accra, because it is  insensitive to high temperatures. Building integration gives security benefits, and  reduces construction costs and embodied energy, compared to freestanding PV  systems. Again, it serves as a means of protection from salt spray from the oceans and  works well even when shaded. However, compared to conventional roofing materials,  3a-Si would increase the indoor temperature by 1-2 °C depending on the surface area  of the roof covered with the PV modules. The results presented in this research  enhance the understanding of varying factors involved in the selection of an  appropriate method of PV installation to offset the short falls of the conventional  roofing material in Ghana.",2010,20.07.21 15:44,20.07.21 15:44,20.07.21 15:44,203-214,,,,,,Building integration photovoltaic module with reference to Ghana,,,,,,Ghana,en,,,,,centaur.reading.ac.uk,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/WUJUZQRL/Essah - 2010 - Building integration photovoltaic module with refe.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/YRUTPGBL/16575.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,West Africa Built Environment Research (WABER) Conference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the use of solar concentrators that form part of a building’s fabric is an area that has received little attention to date. In this study, the design of a novel building integrated photovoltaic/thermal solar concentrator (BIPVTC) is discussed. The design is theoretically analysed and the model validated with experimental data. The results show that BIPVTC offers improved electrical yields from both concentrating radiation onto the photovoltaic cells and also by actively cooling them. Also, it was shown that the BIPVT could be made of a durable (long life) stainless steel, rather than the more reflective aluminium, while still offering a noticeable increase in annual output.",2011,20.07.21 15:52,20.07.21 15:52,20.07.21 15:52,,,,,,,,,,,,Australian Solar Energy Society Ltd,,en,"Auckland University of Technology (AUT) encourages public access to AUT information and supports the legal use of copyright material in accordance with the Copyright Act 1994 (the Act) and the Privacy Act 1993.

UE9ABCRR,journalArticle,2012,Khalil Ebrahim Jasim,Natural dye-sensitized solar cell based on nanocrystalline TiO2,Sains Malaysiana,,0126-6039,,http://www.ukm.my/jsm/,"During the last quarter of the twentieth century there have been intensive research activities looking for green sources of energy. The main aim of the green generators or converters of energy is to replace the conventional (fossil) energy sources, hence reducing further accumulation of the green house gasses GHGs. Conventional silicon and III-V semiconductor solar cell based on crystalline bulk, quantum well and quantum dots structure or amorphous and thin film structures provided a feasible solution. However, natural dye sensitized solar cells NDSSC are a promising class of photovoltaic cells with the capability of generating green energy at low production cost since no vacuum systems or expensive equipment are required in their fabrication. Also, natural dyes are abundant, easily extracted and safe materials. In NDSSC, once dye molecules exposed to light they become oxidized and transfer electrons to a nanostructured layer of wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2. The generated electrons are drawn outside the cell through ohmic contact to a load. In this paper we review the structure and operation principles of the dye sensitized solar cell DSSC. We discuss preparation procedures, optical and electrical characterization of the NDSSC using local dyes extracted from Henna (Lawsonia inermis L.), pomegranate, cherries and Bahraini raspberries (Rubus spp.). These natural organic dyes are potential candidates to replace some of the man-made dyes used as sensitizer in many commercialized photoelectrochemical cells. Factors limiting the operation of the DSSC are discussed. NDSSCs are expected to be a favored choice in the building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) due to their robustness, therefore, requiring no special shielding from natural events such as tree strikes or hails.",2012-08,20.07.21 15:53,20.07.21 15:53,20.07.21 15:53,1011-1016,,8,41,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,journalarticle.ukm.my,,Number: 8 Publisher: Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/82YI3TBQ/Khalil Ebrahim Jasim - 2012 - Natural dye-sensitized solar cell based on nanocry.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/ME96EDHQ/5423.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clear example of  BIPV products consists of semi-transparent photovoltaic modules (STPV), designed to replace the conventional glazing solutions in building façades. Accordingly, the active building envelope is required to perform multiple  requirements such as provide solar shading to avoid overheating, supply solar gains and thermal insulation to reduce heat loads and improve daylight utilization. To date, various studies into STPV systems have focused on their energy performance based on existing simulation programs, or on the modelling, normally validated by limited experimental data, of the STPV modules thermal behaviour. Taking into account that very limited experimental research has been conducted on the energy performance of STPV elements and that the characterization in real operation conditions is necessary to promote an energetically efficient integration of this technology in the building envelope, an outdoor testing facility has been designed, developed and built at the Solar Energy Institute of the Technical University of Madrid.

The aim of the project is to develop integrated process inspection, cleaning, repair and control systems for thin films on flexible photo voltaic films based on CIGS (Copper Indium Gallium Selenide CuInxGa(1-x)Se2). Flexible PV films are fabricated on polymer film by the repeated deposition, and patterning, of thin layer materials using roll-to-roll processes, where the whole film is approximately 3um thick prior to final encapsulation. Take up of such devices, especially for building integrated applications BIPV, is hampered by long-term degradation of efficiency due to water ingress through the barrier layer defects to the CIGS modules causing electrical shorts and efficiency drops. To address this problem a thin (~40nm) barrier coating of Al2O3 usually provides the environmental protection for the PV cells. The highly conformal aluminium oxide barrier layer is produced by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The presentation reports initial measurement and characterisation of prototype films. Characterisation is based on the application of segmentation analysis and where the film is considered to be a special case structured surface and defects are considered as structural elements. Characterisation then allows the correlation of water vapour transmission with defect density to be addressed. The paper also reports on a new in process, high speed, environmentally robust optical interferometer instrument developed to detect defects on the polymer film during manufacture. These results provide the basis for the development of R2R in process metrology devices",20.11.13,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,"National Physical Laboratory , Teddington, Middlesex, UK.",en,,conference,,,,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/MQ7SAI8B/18283.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Metrology Technologies to Enable Reel to Reel Processing of Emerging Products,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One source of renewable energy that can play an important role in this future is solar energy. In Brazil the research institute Centro de Tecnologia da Informação Renato Archer (CTI) was interested in installing a 300 KW/year building integrated photovoltaics plant at their facility located in Campinas. In this plant regular crystalline solar wafers go through an assembly line that can integrate them into a wide variety of building structures such as walls and rooftops. In this way the solar panels become a part of the building instead of an addition to it. During this internship a variety of actions were taken towards realizing the fulfillment of the plant. These actions include designing an appropriate floor plan, the installing and testing of the needed washing plant and mechanical arm, the installing of the solar simulation tunnel and the designing of a number of lay-up and junction box mounting tables. Unfortunately due to external factors and bureaucracy the plant was not finished during the internship period and still a lot of work is needed. However when the plant is fully installed and tested it can start its operation of producing building integrated photovoltaics and more important act as a push in the right direction for the transformation towards a more sustainable energy based future in Brazil.",19.09.13,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Internship report,,,,,Publisher: University of Twente,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/4QF2D6GV/Hengstum - 2013 - Implementation of a BIPV plant at Centro de Tecnol.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/UK79479R/69341.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even the most ancient settlements, to avoid the definitive neglect, will have to be opened towards a “contemporary” logic of refurbishment including a “right” technological contribution as well as an environmentally aware reflection, aimed to establish a deeper dialog with material, water and energetic-climatic resources. In Italian territories hit by earthquake, this challenge is already today a potential for the life return: BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic), or in general PV integration, is one of the possible ways that needs to be faced without ideological preclusions within an eco-sustainable refurbishment approach. The research path is aimed to research possible criteria, compatible tools and examples for the technological transfer of solar systems in the refurbishment processes of minor historical centres. The photovoltaic ""integration project"" in sensitive areas, differently from ordinary contexts, needs a specific methodological approach linked to the topics of ""controlled transformation"" and ""compatibility of integration"". The typical design complexity in these contexts has so far paid a widespread prohibition with few realized examples, although the research has already showed a possible ""acceptance"" even in areas with high values. The study presented deepens the topic of '""photovoltaic integrability"", as an opportunity for a ""possible"" and ""duty"" innovative refurbishment of the historical minor built. The research specifically identifies, for different scales of intervention, possible integration ways of solar systems in the process of reconstruction in L’Aquila, starting from some methodological criteria previously defined for the architectural language control and for the technological requirements of PV components. The outcome of this research could be the introduction of criteria for PV integration in the reconstruction process. This research, once completed and shared (e.g. through guide-lines, tools, quantitative evaluations…), could be a basic instrument for local authorities and operators, to guide the reconstruction policy of the next years on a path of energetic innovation, at the same time eco-friendly, technologically advanced and in full respect of historical, environmental and landscape values of these places.",2013,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Milan, Italy",,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/TSM3XFPX/4785.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IAHS XXXIX World Congress on Housing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European Directive 2010/31/EU establishes that starting from 2020 all new buildings will have to be Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). This will have an impact both in the building’s design by reducing the energy need by the building itself, and in the diffusion of renewable energies on site (near-by), which will produce the remaining part of energy if it is needed. PV will be gaining more and more relevance in the NZEBs design, thanks to its features and potentialities. “BIPV” is for technicians a well-known acronym to indicate PV module used in/on building when PV modules replace part of the traditional building elements of the envelope. Despite the discussion has been treated in several international projects and research programmes, settled up to find a common definition of BIPV and to help the PV manufactures to produce new innovative module suitable for their use in buildings, PV module are still not used on large scale in building and often are not considered at all by architect and designer as a further option in their projects. The paper tries to underline what are the main causes of this causes of this slowdown in the use of PV as building component. Possible solution are also presented especially in order to gives the main stakeholder affordable information of PV module as for a common building component. This paper will start from a review of current definitions used in the field of the use of PV in buildings, and will identify needs for further research.

In addition to their high cost, these plants cause environmental damage, creating the need to investigate sources of clean energy. This study assesses the technical and economic feasibility of implementing Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy in residential houses in Kuwait. Data and information were collected and the appropriate PV system was selected according to cost and PV specifications. Next, the equivalent annual costs of the PV system with various discount rates were estimated together with the cost per kWh both for new and existing houses. Third, the annual reduction of CO2 emissions resulting from implementing grid-tied PV systems was calculated. Taking into consideration the financial savings from CO2 reduction, the cost per kWh was estimated and compared with the current cost. The purported discount rate adopted by the Kuwaiti governmentâ€™s long term plan is 6.7%. However, a range of discount rates from 0% to 20% was applied and results obtained. The results showed that with a 6.7% discount rate the annual savings on energy costs for a new house and a previously constructed hose were KD 745 and KD 653 respectively. The results also revealed the payback periods for the PV system for these houses are 7 and 7.4 years respectively. We concluded that integrated PV (BIPV) solar energy is economical and technically feasible in Kuwait when the discount rate is equal to, or less than, the break-even point of 10.36%.",2013,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,73-82,,2,7,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ideas.repec.org,,Publisher: The Institute for Business and Finance Research,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/TS2VF598/v7y2013i2p73-82.html,,,BIPV; and Solar Energy.; Equivalent Annual Cost; Payback Period; Renewable Energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this improvement can be analyzed quantitatively only if the electricity yield generated by the BIPV system is calculated. This PhD thesis presents a simulation program that calculates the electricity yield generated by BIPV systems, including those made of geometrically complex BIPV modules. The simulation is based on a combination of a ray-tracing procedure with the resultant I-V curves of electrically connected PV cells. For the annual electricity yield, multi-core cluster computers are applied to perform the simulation on the basis of 5-minute meteorological data throughout a year. The ray-tracing technique is applied to calculate inhomogeneous irradiation, the consequence of shading or reflections from surrounding objects, and the quantitative relevance of reflections from the ground. The temperatures of the PV cells are calculated by taking the physical principles of heat conduction, heat convection and thermal radiation into account. The cell I-V curves are calculated depending on the temperature and the irradiance. After the virtual interconnection of the PV cells in the simulation, the effect of inverter efficiency and its dependence on the generator voltage are calculated, finally leading to the AC power of the BIPV system. All parts of the simulation are validated by comparison with measurements, and the accuracy of the simulation is quantified with the help of statistical measures. Finally, the simulation program is applied to calculate the electricity yield generated by two BIPV systems.",2013,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tudelft.nl,,Publisher: Fraunhofer-Verlag,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/DCBAR2GC/uuid3bd97b56-3edb-4071-8d5e-fe901b9d6e23.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The eight-storey apartment house was built in 1965 and was in poor condition after 45 years, when it was decided that refurbishment would be advisable. The target set by the owner was to renovate the building totally and to achieve the passive house standard. At the beginning of the construction phase the builders raised the goal even higher, and decided that the application of BIPV modules to the entire façades could achieve the Plus energy house standard (netZero Energy building).  In addition to the BIPV façades, a single-axis tracking photovoltaic system was also installed on the pergola roof terrace in October of 2013, as a final option. Solar thermal collectors (vacuum tubes) are also used to reduce the heating demand and to increase the COP of the heat Pump. This paper describes the building before and after renovation, and discusses the critical points in the planning phase and during construction of the 45kWp BIPV ventilated façades.

A significant advantage of BIPV compared to non-integrated systems is the lack of the need to allocate neither land nor additional mounting structures and to favor local use of energy (self-consumption solutions at building or district level). As a drawback, the operating temperature of BIPV systems are usually higher compared to free standing PV systems because of limited cooling (1,2). Maintaining or reducing the operating temperature of PV elements is important during the photovoltaic energy conversion process since it influences the efficiency, the decline in performance over time and the lifetime of the PV system. In this paper, we present and analyze experimental results of the monitoring of ten BIPV systems realized within the “Performance BIPV” project (partners CSTB, CEA, CNRS, Transénergie and Cythelia) and by EURAC in three European locations. The aim of our study is to investigate and compare the operative temperature issue in different BIPV applications. Each BIPV system is instrumented to record component temperatures (at the backside of PV modules), electrical production and environmental conditions. The monitored BIPV systems dataset is compared with two ground mounted PV plants located in Bolzano, which are monitored by EURAC since 2010 (3–5). The variation of PV module temperatures rise above ambient temperature is studied as a function of the global irradiation. Based on measured data, an empirical equivalent thermal resistance between PV modules and ambient temperature is considered for various time scales based on a static model. An overview on empirical equivalent thermal resistance values for each analyzed system is provided, resulting in a range from 0.0297 to 0.0397 for most of the BIPV systems and from 0.0249 to 0.0291 for the not-integrated PV systems.

This exploratory research identifies issues which arise following the specification of BIPV in non-residential construction projects. Rather than treating the inclusion of a new technology as a technical problem, the research explores the issue from a socio-technical perspective to understand the accommodations which the project team makes and their effect on the building and the technology. The paper is part of a larger research project which uses a Social Construction of Technology Approach (SCOT) to explore the accommodations made to working practices and design when Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) technology is introduced. The approach explores how the requirements of the technology from different groups of actors (Relevant Social Groups or RSG's) give rise to problems and create solutions. As such it rejects the notion of a rational linear view of innovation diffusion; instead it suggests that the variety and composition of the Relevant Social Groups set the agenda for problem solving and solutions as the project progresses. The research explores the experiences of three people who have extensive histories of involvement with BIPV in construction, looks at how SCOT can inform our understanding of the issues involved and identifies themes and issues in the specification of BIPV on construction projects. A key finding concerns the alignment of inflection points at which interviewees have found themselves changing from one RSG to another as new problems and solutions are identified. The points at which they change RSG often occurred at points which mirror conventional construction categories (in terms of project specification, tender, design and construction).",2014,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,Portsmouth,en,,,,,centaur.reading.ac.uk,,ISSN: 9000-0897,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/8G94AQRT/Boyd et al. - 2014 - Perspectives on the specification of Building Inte.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/JMNU8A8Y/44653.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Proceedings 30th Annual ARCOM Conference, 1-3 September 2014, Portsmouth, UK, Association of Researchers in Construction Management, 153–62.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BiPV) involves two main topics: construction technology and architecture. One of the keyaspects is the multi-functionality: PV becomes a constructive part of the building envelope that cannot be just considered as a single plant since it strongly characterize architecture, technology, energy behaviour and costs. Despite in literature many examples show the high potential of PV integration in buildings, the complexity of the involved requirements do not always suggest the BiPV as an easy option in the early design phase. Consequently PV is often postponed to a later stage of the construction to simply be adapted onto the building with the cheapest option. Purpose of the work, starting from a multicriteria approach, is to give a contribution concerning the economic assessment of BiPV, through the evaluation of costs and benefits in a life-cycle perspective. Results allow to appreciate the essential role of PV in the building envelope design confirming that in some cases BiPV is a cost-effective opportunity so that the economic worth joins the quality of the building.",2014,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Brixen, Italy",,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/4DBNAG9X/5747.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy Forum on Solar Building Skin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the strategies to realize a significant CO2 reduction is by integrating photovoltaic modules in the building envelope (BIPV). Disadvantages of BIPV include a possibly lower energy output and a possibly decreased life span due to the lack of optimal cooling of the PV modules. Currently, cooling of PV modules is usually realized by passive back-string ventilation, which is under strain when integration PV modules in the building envelope. In this study, a comparative field study of BIPV is conducted in the field lab 'The District of Tomorrow'to generate insight into BIPV efficiency as a function of back-string ventilation. This paper presents a selection of the monitoring results of the realized system, consisting of 24 PY modules in 4 segments with a total of 6000 Wp output with different amounts of back-string ventilation. The measurements indicate that in a moderate climate BIPV solutions without back-string ventilation result in increased operating temperatures, lower electricity output and condensation between PV modules and rooftop surface.

Thermal boundary layers on vertical flat surfaces of a PV (photovoltaic) and a metallic plate were traversed. The plate consisted of twelve heaters where heat flux and surface temperature were controlled and measured. Uniform heat flux condition was developed on the heaters to closely simulate non-uniform temperature distribution on vertical PV modules. The two thermocouples on the probe measured local air temperature and contact temperature with the wall surface. Experimental results were presented in the forms of local Nusselt numbers versus Rayleigh numbers “Nu = a·(Ra)b”, and surface temperature versus dimensionless height (Ts – T∞ = c·(z/h)d). The constant values for “a”, “b”, ”c” and “d” were determined from the best curve-fitting to the power-law relation. The convection heat transfer predictions from the empirical correlations were found to be in consistent with those predictions made by a number of correlations published in the open literature. A simple technique is then proposed to employ two experimental data from the probe to refine empirical correlations as the operational conditions change. A flexible technique to update correlations is of prime significance requirement in thermal design and operation of BIPV modules.

There is a broad scope of different BIPV applications (e.g. roofing, façades, skylights, glazing, etc.). This study limited itself to the applications for pitched roofing in the Dutch residential sector. Two types of BIPV applications (tiles, in-roof systems) were compared to conventional roofing and conventional Building-Attached Photo-Voltaic (BAPV) roofing solutions. Suppliers of BIPV systems were invited to quote on a virtual home with the target to make the house net electricity zero. Two virtual homes were defined. The first virtual home was a terraced house with 60 m2 roof area and 3300 kWh/a electricity usage. The second virtual home was a detached house with 125 m2 of roof area and 4600 kWh/a electricity usage. The quotes were split up in various categories including electrical connection costs (cables, inverter, AC connection), PV installation costs, PV fastening system costs, PV panels costs, Installation costs, and conventional roofing materials costs. In total, 11 quotes for BIPV systems were received. These were well-distributed over the two categories of BIPV in-roof systems and BIPV tiles. In addition, 8 quotes on conventional BAPV systems were gathered for price comparison. It was chosen to report the turn-key prices for the full roof upgrade rather than the common unit of €/Wp, because only in this way a clean comparison between the various solutions to make the house net electricity neutral could be made. From the analysis of the prices, the following key conclusions can be drawn: - Turn-key prices for retrofitting a BAPV system and make the house net electricity neutral are €6,000 for a terraced and €8,000 for a detached house. BIPV in-roof mounting systems add €2,500 to these costs, due to three main effects: o Additional labour is required due to the removal of the existing roof tiles. o Suppliers of BIPV in-roof mounting systems tend to choose high quality European brand PV panels in their systems, whereas BAPV system suppliers tend to choose low-cost Asian brand PV panels. o More costs are made in the installation process, due to a more complicated and slower installation process than BAPV systems. - Turn-key prices for renovating a full roof and then adding a BAPV system to make the house net electricity neutral are €10,000 for a terraced and €16,000 for a detached house. BIPV in-roof mounting systems add €1,000 to these costs. Cost savings are made for requiring less roof tiles, but additional expenses are needed for the use of more expensive high quality brand PV panels and longer installation times required. - Several suppliers of BIPV tiles are active on the Dutch market. Their products are meant to blend better into the roof’s optical appearance and consequently improve the overall aesthetical quality of the house. A large price spread within the products that are offered exists. The cheapest BIPV tile solution for a turn-key roof renovation was €14,000 euro for a terraced and €21,000 euro for a detached house. The most expensive solution was €23,000 euro for a terraced and €35,000 euro for a detached house. The large price range suggests a proto niche market or sub-segmentation within this product group. - Comparing the dwelling types with each other we see an overall price advantage in favour for larger roof systems. The electricity producing roof on a detached house was approx. 20% cheaper per m2 than the same system on a terraced house, for all three system types of BAPV, BIPV in-roof systems and BIPV tiles.",2015,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,BIPV pricing in the Netherlands,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tno.nl,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/NGM2DF87/uuid406b6380-de69-432b-98ae-b64c3c6557cd.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NHP4FC6L,journalArticle,2015,"Hemmelgarn, D.",Efficiency - Facade PLUS - to form an urban Benchmark,,,,,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Aa18e0e0d-3a7e-44dd-8723-5c16a2ecffa2,"Intension In this graduation project I will make a redevelopment of the Q-Port building to a Hotel and Congress Centre: On the one hand, my project focuses on the refurbishment of an office façade into an energy producing façade. This renew has an ecological, social and economic importance. These three aspects reflect my sustainable approach. On the other hand, the establishment of a new use strategy for the Q-Port building in form of a Hotel and Congress Centre plays a key role. The Q-Port building is a bad example of urban planning when an important aspect of life – work – leads to mono-functional urban sectors. Instead of thinking in certain functional categories, I want to create spaces in the urban context in which we simply enjoy living – spaces with leeway for individuality – regardless of how large the building is. KEY Feature - “Grüne Lunge” Key feature of my design is the “Grüne Lunge”, an open public way and an energy generating technology as design element of the façade to unite the urban concept and the energy concept within the façade design. The redesign of the Q-Port building is linked to the historic urban planning strategy to be a green recreational area. Urban porosity is the key intention of the new hybrid Q-Port building with the aim of pedestrian oriented urban places. The transformed Q-Port building becomes localized a `social condenser´ for new communities: The “Grüne Lunge”, an open public space spirals upwards from the street and guides the people through the building. ReDesign The redesign is not only use related but also energy efficient with the design of an energy generating façade, which makes the building to an energy production. In the focus there is an active intelligent façade, the “Grüne Lunge”, in relation to the climate of a building and the possibility for the urban context: The façade is my fascination because it shows most dominant the architectural value of a building. It is the visible statement to the world and it gives a face to the building. Façades connect the inside space and the outside city rooms and have a high potential as multifunctional construction elements. The new task of the façade in my design is, that the “Grüne Lunge”, which is an open public way, is linked to the energy concept of the whole building and is main part of the ventilation concept. The “Grüne Lunge” is an open public way, which spirals upwards, and guaranties natural ventilation in the rooms. In the summer time it transports cold air from the north side of the building into the south part. The night cooling out of the building in the summer is done by the “Grüne Lunge”. In the winter time the air is transported from the south side of the building and is preheated in the buffer zone of the “Grüne Lunge” and flows over an air guide system in the suspended floors into the rooms. Moreover, the “Grüne Lunge” acts as an interspace and a connection point for the public and private activities within the building. Benchmark The perforated glass in the building envelope is only broken by the transparent envelope of the “Grüne Lunge”. The “Grüne Lunge” in the building`s envelope can be seen from the highway or the streets and by this people get interested in the new use strategy of the Q Port building. The new Q Port building should become a highlight building in the Brettenzone like a Benchmark for the city part Brettenzone. Therefore the installation of a media façade which offers surface for commercial activities is done in addition to the BIPV modules at the closed façade parts. This is the next step into a more sustainable future: The energy concept for the Q-Port building is able to generate energy within the façade and so unifies the energy demands of the future.",2015,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,20.07.21 15:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tudelft.nl,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/X9BHWPYK/Hemmelgarn - 2015 - Efficiency - Facade PLUS - to form an urban Benchm.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/8MWQ34CX/uuida18e0e0d-3a7e-44dd-8723-5c16a2ecffa2.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New system architectures have been proposed to optimize performance. The common approach of these new architectures is to track the Maximum Power Point (MPP) of every solar module individually. A simulation model is developed to quantify the benefits and drawbacks of different PV system architectures. The model includes a shading evaluation of the installation with means of 3D modeling, irradiance calculations, PV cell modelling and finally an empirical power conversion model. The energy yield of three leading architectures is confirmed (string inverter, power optimizer, micro inverter) for clear and partial shading conditions by means of an outdoor field test. Results show that there is a clear benefit for MLPE systems at higher irradiance when partial shading is present.

Among many types of BIPV modules, translucent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar module has expand the range of applications to include windows, sunroofs and skylights, where it can be useful for both purpose of generating electricity and transparency for sunlight at the day time. There are two main types of translucent a-Si PV modules. The first one builds with a transparent conductive oxide thin film, instead of the metal film, as the back electrode. However, this type of module only allows light with wavelengths longer than 500 nm to pass through, leading to a reddish light and therefore visual discomfort. The other type translucent a-Si PV module uses the so-called ?P4 laser process? to remove silicon and back electrode layers so as to allow nature light transmission. In this study, 10% transmittance a-Si:H thin film solar modules are fabricated by laser processes. Effects of P4 laser line width and scribing directions, vertical, spot-like and horizontal in relation to the modules, are investigated. Firstly for the P4 laser line width optimization from 30-60 µm, the experimental result shows that with a constant transmittance, a module having a large line width could improve fill factor and conversion efficiency due to reduction of scribed line number needed, thus decreasing the damage of silicon layers. The 60 µm P4 laser line width leads to a minimum of performance degradation of about 11%. Further increasing the line width may need to introduce additional optical lens system to change laser beam distribution. Secondly, I-V curves and parameters of the modules fabricated using three different scribing directions show that the vertically scribed module has a high series resistance of 19.3 ? due to the long carrier transport length and small cross-sectional area. The spot-like module has the highest leakage current and diode ideality factor, indicating a reduced silicon film quality. This is likely due to spot-like scribing creating the largest amount of laser line edges, which usually contains high defects caused by laser thermal affection. The horizontally scribed module has the best fill factor, and the intermediate open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. Finally, the horizontal scribing can lead to the lowest conversion efficiency degradation of about 12.7%.

XENMQ2ZZ,journalArticle,2015,"Baias, Andreea Bianca",Renovating Building through Energy Roof and Facade Systems,,,,,http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/7761495,"Nowadays society is becoming more aware of the fact that energy use has a negative environmental impact, contributing to fossil fuels depletion and global warming increase. Therefore, the Swedish Parliament has adopted the The European Comission’s 20-20-20 goals, climate and energy policy targets that shall be achieved by 2020, referring to 20% reduction of CO2 emissions, 20% increase in energy efficiency and 20% renewable resources (Heinsten, 2013). One way to achieve these standards is to consider the strategy of renovating buildings using building integrated photovoltaic systems. Responding directly to the building’s needs, such systems replace conventional materials for the building envelope and generate power at the same time, improving the eco-efficiency of the building. Through the use of simulation software like Design Builder and Sam (System Advisor Model) and calculations, the present study aims to suggest renovation solutions of a building’s envelope, using energy systems (building integrated photovoltaics), for a multi-family building, situated in Malmö, Sweden. The research strives to give an overview over existing renovation projects which implemented buildings integrated photovoltaics, and future prospects and barriers in building integrated photovoltaic industry. The results of the study show performance of a wide range of building integrated photovoltaic systems for the roof and façade of a building in Malmö, Sweden, for active renovation strategies, alone or combined with some passive renovation strategies. The general conclusion of this research is that energy systems (BIPV) can have a positive contribution to the energy renovation of the studied residential building, from Malmö, Sweden, but their impact varies according to factors which need to be taken into account before choosing such a renovation strategy. Building integrated photovoltaics should be considered due to their multi functionality as a building component (replaces a traditional building element, produces electricity, increases the appealing aesthetics of a building, increases the environmentally friendly factor of a building due to renewable energy).",2015,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eng,info:eu-repo/semantics/restrictedAccess,,,,lup.lub.lu.se,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/DC8CH7T2/7761495.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Report 2015,,,,,https://repository.supsi.ch/7202/,"Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is about multifunctional building elements that generate electricity. BIPV therefore brings the worlds of construction and photovoltaics together with all the challenges and chances inherent to such a change of paradigm. After more than 20 years of R&D, the market for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) has kicked off with very interesting products and elegant showcase projects. The birth of this market has been based on an enormous progress in PV technology development (cost-wise and performance-wise), together with the vision of some leading architects and industries. Today the European BIPV market is supported by approximately 200 commercially available products. The SUPSI-SEAC report 2015 gives a comprehensive overview of BIPV, its product classification, its price levels, its available products and its example projects. The report starts off with an adapted classification of BIPV systems according to the most recent developments in the market. We believe that this classification system serves the purpose of understanding the market segmentation and the product segmentation in BIPV. Three main application areas are distinguished: Pitched roofs, flat & curved roofs and façades. The application areas are sub-divided into thirteen different product categories. A short description and a photograph of an application is given per product category. Next, we investigate the price levels for the various product categories. The investigation was made by asking Dutch and Swiss BIPV installers to quote on a fictional building. PV products were found to be priced about 200 €/m2 above conventional roof products like tiles or shingles. In façade systems, this is different. PV products were priced very similar to conventional façades made from materials like wood, stone or glass. A major factor in the price levels of the BIPV applications was whether standard size PV panels or nonstandard size PV panels were used. In the first case BIPV pricing could come close to conventional PV pricing. In the second case the price could be a factor 3 higher than conventional PV applications. We also present our updated database of BIPV products available. It consists of 108 BIPV products that are commercially available in Europe, with a focus on the Dutch and Swiss markets. The database evolved out of the networks of SEAC and SUPSI together with results of our internet search and trade fair visits. In earlier publications, the market analysis made through the database of the SUPSI website and the published BIPV report by SEAC showed that the most common products for roof applications were “In-roof mounting systems”, while “solar glazing” and “cold façades” (”cladding”) represented the majority of façade applications. In this new analysis, we find that the most abundantly populated product categories are “Full roof solution” and “Solar glazing”. The least occupied product groups are “PV membranes”, “Metal panels” and “Warm façades”. Judging from the sheer amount of products available, rooftop applications have the largest market share within BIPV. In the utility and commercial segments, façade BIPV systems are expected to gain importance. The key market driver for this segment is the European Directive 2010/31/EU, which states that each new building should be made ‘nearly zero energy’ from 2020 onwards. Façade PV systems are essential to meet this demand, as in many utility and commercial buildings the roof is simply not large enough to generate all the required energy. The dominant PV technology in BIPV is found to be crystalline silicon (c-Si). Nonetheless, relatively high market shares for thin film technology of up to 25% are found. Thin film PV technology is getting significant attention especially in façade systems, because of its homogeneous color (black) appearance and a lower price per m2. A potential market opportunity lies in lightweight flexible thin film products for application on curved surfaces and flat roofs with small weight capacity. Many example projects can be found, but commercially available products are not easy to find, and do not appear in this year’s database. Eight examples of BIPV projects are described from various product categories and application areas. We hope these existing projects will serve as catalysts, from which more architects, construction companies and end-users will get stimulated to apply BIPV solutions in their buildings. Finally, we wish to look ahead towards a successful BIPV future. In our vision, the further development of the BIPV market in Europe will depend on a number of key factors. Three of those factors are related to a stable predictable market situation:  ◆ A stable and predictable roadmap of building directives and regulations: BIPV as the way to meet energy regulations for buildings and at the same time satisfy value drivers in the building industry (investor’s value, architectural quality, comfort); ◆ Development of European harmonized standards, technical rules and building codes in order to allow BIPV products to address the complete European market; A stable and predictable roadmap of financial incentives (market stimulation) for PV application in general. Other success factors are related to product positioning, supply chain and cooperation between sectors:  ◆ Concerted efforts by players in the BIPV supply chain to work together in accordance with a collaborative and integral design/building process. BIPV will require not only a technological integration but an integration in the whole building process; ◆ Smart engineering and manufacturing of BIPV products such that low cost (€/Wp as well as €/m 2) can be combined with the high mix requirements from the building market. In the meantime, a way to approach the price-challenge would be to sell BIPV in a “irrational way”. That is as a feel-good product, a fashion product and/or a status product. This will take the buying decision away from considerations like payback time. ◆ A broad support and acceptance of the central BIPV vision: i.e. that BIPV can be considered as a building material producing energy; ◆ Europe is a front runner in policy development on sustainability (building codes, incentives). Furthermore the European industry is well positioned as a supplier of high mix product offerings based on smart engineering and innovative technology. Therefore we believe that BIPV is a very promising product-market combination for European industry!",2015,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,,,,,,,,,,,,Scuola Universitaria professionale della Svizzera italiana,,en,,Report,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/YCPHKBRN/Frontini et al. - 2015 - Building Integrated Photovoltaics.

A social construction of technology (SCOT) approach is used to explore the integration of Building Integrated Photovoltaic technology (BIPV) into three commercial projects. By exploring the succession of problems and solutions shaping the uptake of BIPV, the analysis also documents the mutual constitution of both the technology and the building in which it is located. The interest of BIPV lies in the bespoke, system nature of the innovation. Three decision modes are identified which help to explain how solutions can “lock in” features of either the technology or the building, often at the expense of the desired outcome. The research gives practical insights into how the incorporation of technology can shape the building into which it sits and how this processes occurs.",2016,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,693-705,,,IV,,,How did we get opaque windows?,,,,,Tampere University of Technology,"Tampere, Finland",en,,,,,centaur.reading.ac.uk,,Conference Name: 2016 World Building Congress ISSN: 1797-8904 Meeting Name: 2016 World Building Congress,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/AB84VLQS/Boyd and Schweber - 2016 - How did we get opaque windows - Mutual constituti.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/XLYUA3G7/77940.html,,,,"Nenonen, S.; Junnonen, J.-M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This will have an impact both in the building’s design by reducing the energy need by the building itself, and in the diffusion of renewable energies on site (near-by), which will produce the remaining part of energy if it is needed. PV will be gaining more and more relevance in the NZEBs design, thanks to its features and potentialities. “BIPV” is for technicians a well-known acronym to indicate PV module used in/on building when PV modules replace part of the traditional building elements of the envelope. Despite the discussion has been treated in several international projects and research programmes, settled up to find a common definition of BIPV and to help the PV manufactures to produce new innovative module suitable for their use in buildings, PV module are still not used on large scale in building and often are not considered at all by architect and designer as a further option in their projects. The paper tries to underline what are the main causes of this slowdown in the use of PV as building component. Possible solution are also presented especially in order to gives the main stakeholder affordable information of PV module as for a common building component. This paper will start from a review of current definitions used in the field of the use of PV in buildings, and will identify needs for further research. The starting point will be the experience of the authors in several international research project, in the International Energy Agency (SHC Task 41 Solar Energy and Architecture; SHC-ECBCS Task 40-Annex 52 Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings) and, in particular, the participation in the EU 7th FP project “Construct PV”.",2016,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,49-54,,3,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,Number: 3,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/KUTUSITT/7834.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photovoltaics (PV) is recognized as one of the most reliable solutions to be used in future buildings for producing electricity and transforming the building skin from a passive barrier towards a sensible, active and adaptive interface. In detail, Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) glass modules, used for transparent facades, skylights or balustrades, are a promising way to integrate solar energy into building envelope since they can contribute both in a passive and active way within the bioclimatic design. However, so far BIPV glass modules are still considered as a solution for exclusive constructions, due to design and installation complexity, additional requirements, higher costs in comparison to conventional photovoltaic modules and the “new” architectural language of the building skin. Within this framework Smart-Flex is an European project that aims to overcome some of the barriers by means of the demonstration of the flexible manufacturing of multifunctional BIPV glass elements at the industrial scale and their use for “conventional” buildings. Indeed, an intelligent and automatic manufacturing process has been developed, as well as a novel digital printing for glass. Thanks to such innovations, it is possible to customize the BIPV glass modules with the desired geometry, patterns and colors to replace perfectly the conventional building envelope components. However, the partial covering of the BIPV glass modules due to the printing, on one hand, contributes to design the aesthetical appearance of the facade but, on the other hand, it involves a “price to pay” in the final power output. Therefore, this paper focuses on experimental activities done by the authors to evaluate the electrical behavior of different colored modules developed in the framework of the Smart-Flex project with the goal to point out novel approaches for the customization and design of “active” coloured façades.",08.09.16,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,,,,,,,Colored BIPV glass modules,,,,,,,,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/7MIGU5CC/7820.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When installed in facades, laminated BIPV glass can be installed with different mounting structures and fixing configurations that should ensure mechanical safety and adequate operational conditions (e.g. adequate resistance preventing excessive deflec-tions) along with the safety of users indoor or outside the building. However, so far, the BIPV glass elements are mainly tested as conventional PV products in accordance with the IEC 61215:2005. In detail, in order to assess the mechanical ability to withstand wind and/or snow loads, a standard load test is performed with a pass/fail criteria based on the absence of electrical damages rather than on the assessment of the static behaviour and the limit states for safety and/or operation. For example, the deflections are not evaluated in this approach even though they are an important parameter to check, especially where glass is used as primary building skin such as in case of curtain walls. This paper includes the evaluation of the deflections of laminated BIPV glass ele-ments resulting from the IEC mechanical testing, including the comparison with the limit states prescribed in the Eurocode and other recommendations for laminated glass to be used in buildings.",21.09.16,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,20.07.21 15:55,363-372,,,,,,Laminated BIPV glass,,,,,,,,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/9PVYT5DH/7821.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Engineered Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A software tool for customized BIPV in a BIM-based process,,978-3-433-03187-2,,,https://repository.supsi.ch/7877/,"Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) means today the possibility for the building skin to produce renewable energy in a safe, reliable and affordable way. Façade engineering and planning plays a fundamental role in this challenge and BIPV, along with other innovative technologies and solutions, opens a concrete opportunity to address the target of nearly-Zero or Plus-Energy Building. Most of the BIPV applications in façades concern glazed systems where PV cells are included within a laminated glass (e.g. in curtain walls or structural façade). Integrating photovoltaic in surfaces of the building envelope, involves a strong integration of energy, electrical, architectural and construction requirements during the whole process, from early-design phase till to manufacturing and operation. A collaborative and integrated planning approach by architects, engineers and manufacturers becomes essential, so that the development of methods, models and tools oriented to optimally support an integrated planning and construction process (i.e. the BIM approach) is a crucial aspect of growing interest. In the framework of the European project Construct PV, the authors collaborated in developing a web-tool aimed to support, since the early design phase, the integrated design of a customizable BIPV component for the integration into the building skin, within an interoperable process based on Building Information Modeling (BIM). The tool allows the customization of both physical (light transmittance, power,..) and constructive (dimensions, layers,..) features with the goal to cover all the main possibilities in terms of product design, such as the module’s layering, the use of different materials (such as different glass types), the shape, the cell’s arrangement, etc. with the result to define a 3D geometry of the component in a realistic graphic environment. The second step focused on developing a plug-in to create interoperability with a BIM-based process.

T.",De structuur van het innovatiesysteem van BIPV,,,,,http://essay.utwente.nl/71985/,"Hekkert et al. published an article in 2007 with a description of an innovation system. A method has been developed for the execution of a innovation system analyses, taking that description in mind. This method is described in “Innovatiesysteemanalyse voor beleidsanalisten. Een handleiding” by Hekkert et al. in 2011. A TIS (Technological innovation system)-analyses gives the opportunities and barriers of a technology. The result of such an analyses is determining for the role Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO.nl) plays in stimulating the particular technology. The PV technology sector is performing well. According Huijben and Verbond (2013) it would even be valuable if the Dutch PV market would be taken as an example for future PV market growth. Within the PV sector, there are nowadays a lot of different techniques exploited. Because of the broad range of different PV principles, it is to be expected that a broad range of PV products will enter the market. One category of those expected products is building integrated PV (BIPV). Berenschot (2015) defines BIPV as follows: “We consider Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics, or BIPV, in this roadmap trace as the aesthetic and functional integrating of solar power generating functions with regular building elements. Here the building elements contains, besides the electricity generating function, minimal one functionality in the building shell. Besides that, it is the purpose to gain full integration. Aesthetic integration means in a lot of cases that the PV-function cannot be traced from the countenance of the building, or particularly an element where the attention is especially drawn to because of the aesthetical character.” (Berenschot, 2015) The conventional PV products that are regarded BAPV (Building Applied PV), such as standard modules, are occasionally considered as ugly. Therefore, conventional PV products could possibly obtain a NOMyR (Not on my roof) status. Because of this societal barrier, generating of sustainable energy by PV will be less. BIPV should prevent this because the aesthetics are taken into account. If the government decides to pay extra attention to BIPV, it is handy to know if the attention is necessary and where exactly the attention is required within the innovation system of BIPV. RVO.nl is producing a TIS analyses of BIPV. For a proper TIS analyses it is essential to map the structure of the innovation system of the considered technology. In this document the innovation system of BIPV is revealed with the purpose to be a foundation for the TIS analyses of BIPV.",22.02.16,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Internship report,,,,,Publisher: University of Twente,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/7AGUV35S/Meijvogel - 2016 - De structuur van het innovatiesysteem van BIPV.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/DQIIHSVZ/71985.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HKPBX8TU,thesis,,"Ingenito, A.; Zeman, M.; Isabella, O.; Delft University of Technology",Opto-electrical surface engineering of wafer based c-Si solar cells,,,,,http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:1cc31eff-4871-4d6f-8f32-8669257dc1ab,"Climate changes due to increase of CO2 emission are becoming a serious issue for this planet. The so called climate crisis has been the main topic of the last United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) . Direct conversion of sunlight into electricity is one of the most promising technology for achieving the COP 21 agreement. Wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells account for more than 90% of the total PV market because silicon is a non-toxic and abundant material and Si-based PV modules have demonstrated long term stability and high durability. To maintain this technology dominant also in the coming years, continuous improvement in conversion efficiency without increasing processing costs are required. In this thesis novel solutions based on opto-electrical surface engineering are presented as potential solutions to increase conversion efficiency and/or decrease the costs of wafer-based c-Si solar cells. In particular, advanced light management techniques were developed to enhance light absorption in thin c-Si absorber and to fabricate customized PV products for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. This thesis begins with introducing, theoretical limits (Chapter 1), working principles and current status (Chapter 2) of waferbased c-Si solar cells. In Chapter 3 the losses analysis of industrial multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell was performed by using the ASA simulation tool. Such analysis pointed out the main opto-electrical losses for a mc-Si solar cell which were tackled in the next Chapters. In particular, Chapter 4 deals with design and fabrication of advanced light trapping scheme for minimizing optical losses of state-of-the-art c-Si solar cells. To this aim a combination of surface textures with different geometrical scales were used in order to trigger several optical effects. In particular, nano-texturing fabricated via reactive ion etching (RIE) on the front side and micro texturing based on alkaline etching on the rear side were used providing broadband light-in coupling and light scattering. Almost ideal back reflectors such as Ag or Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) were applied on the rear side. By using such light trapping scheme, the so-called 4n2 absorption enhancement limit, which has been elusive for more than 30 years was experimentally demonstrated on a broad wavelength range. The interdigitated back contact (IBC) c-Si solar cell was indicated as the most promising solar cell architecture to apply such light trapping scheme. This technology was not available within the PVMD group. Therefore, in Chapter 5 a simplified self-aligned process for fabrication high efficiency IBC c-Si solar cells was demonstrated. The process involved the combination of ion implantation and epitaxial growth of in-situ doped Si. The process flow was optimized to minimize the thermal budget and the number of lithographic steps. By using only two lithographic steps, a conversion efficiency equal to 20.2% on 9 cm2 device was demonstrated. For such solar cell architecture it was shown that a lightly doped front surface field improves carrier collection. After developing a process flow for fabricating IBC c-Si solar cells, the application of the advanced light management technique to IBC was presented in Chapter 6. To this aim two major issues were tackled. The first was related to the removal of surface defects induced by the RIE process to decrease surface recombination. To achieve this goal a cost effective process was developed. The second dealt with adapting the light trapping scheme to the IBC process integration. To this aim, the decoupled front (nano-textured) and rear side (micotexturing) light trapping scheme of Chapter 4 was modified by superposing both texture scales on the front side of the wafer. This approach is called modulated surface texture (MST). The combination of the advanced light trapping and surface passivation schemes was employed in IBC c-Si solar cells. Top efficiency of 19.8% for MST-IBC solar cell was demonstrated. Advanced light management techniques were also applied to bifacial c-Si solar cells. The objective of this study was twofold: (i) enhancing cell efficiency by increasing the internal rear internal reflectance and (ii) providing novel solutions for BIPV applications. In particular, DBR and TiO2 particles in the form of white paint were used as back reflectors of bifacial c-Si solar cells. The DBR enabled the possibility of fabricating rear side coloured bifacial modules, which can be attractive for BIPV applications.",,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,www.narcis.nl,,DOI: 10.4233/uuid:1cc31eff-4871-4d6f-8f32-8669257dc1ab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, dealing with PV in architecture is still a challenge for architects and engineers both because of aesthetic and technical issues. There are at least two ways to integrate photovoltaic technologies in the building skin design concept: emphasizing the use of solar energy (high-tech approach) or trying to hide them with the use of a camouflage technology, thanks to the use of colour filters or painting techniques. This paper focus on the investigation of the performance behaviour of different coloured modules developed within the European Project SMART-FLeX. Within the project a special digital technique has been developed to print the front glass of BIPV modules, offering to the architect many possibility of design. It is clear, that paintings on front glass will shadow the solar cells, influencing in that way the performance of modules. In order to assess the impact of this technology on module performance extensive indoor measurements have been done by the authors. Therefore, prototype modules of different colour and printing degrees were assembled and investigated under standard and weak-light conditions, electroluminescence tests, spectral responsivity and temperature coefficient measurements.

A prototype of a building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) solar air collector has been built by a Palo Alto start-up company, and consists on a double pane airflow window wall with photovoltaic (PV) louvers embedded in it. The unit is intended to perform the functions of both thermal and electrical generation, as well as light transmission and shading control. In this work, the prototype's performance has been tested in different outdoor conditions and under different airflow speeds, with the aim of investigating its thermal and electrical capabilities. The results presented in this thesis showed an optimal behaviour during the winter, with a maximum air temperature rise (from bottom to top) of about 30°C and average thermal efficiency of 31%. By using inexpensive PV modules with a rated efficiency of 12.5%, an actual electrical efficiency of 7% was recorded under the maximum operating temperatures.",2017,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Santa Cruz,,en,,,,,escholarship.org,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/XZE2C4R2/Chialastri - 2017 - Characterization of an airflow solar window.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/TPAXH4UC/71w4c94q.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The issue is acute as many of these complex technologies such as advanced building skins (ABS) are integrated with the building structure, rather than being bolt-on additions. Building integrated photovoltaic technologies (BIPV) are an example of ABS and pose challenges for construction professionals. Research has until now understood BIPV through idealised project management processes, but with little empirical research. Using a socio-technical approach, this research aims to understand the “real world” of construction projects and to explore how practitioners make BIPV integration a reality. This research follows three building projects where BIPV was specified, following the negotiations, decision making and institutional logics, which play out. The implications of project management demands and conventions on the integration of the technology are explored, identifying institutional obstacles to integrating BIPV into the building. Findings include changing interests and requirements shaping the technology, friction interfaces between the technology and the other building elements and conflicting priorities of project management conventions and technical details. The importance of this research is to deconstruct the practicalities of incorporating BIPV into building projects so that construction professionals, technology developers and suppliers can understand the challenges and opportunities occurring as ABS are integrated into the building envelope.",05.10.17,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,20.07.21 15:57,,,,,,,The uptake of BIPV within a project environment,,,,,,"Bern, Switzerland",en,,,,,centaur.reading.ac.uk,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/BPPKCTHP/Boyd and Larsen - 2017 - The uptake of BIPV within a project environment t.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/79UBCZAS/75880.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International Conference on Advanced Building Skins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The building was completed in 1986 and houses approximately 1150 students and a staff of 148 members. Obtained by Skolfastigheter AB by the end of the year of 2016, the company initiated a planning phase for a renovation. Together with STUNS (the foundation for collaboration between Uppsala's universities, enterprises and society) a project aimed at assessing which effciency measures would be best suited for implementation, considering sustainability and affordability, was started. The main components being energy mapping, compiling possible energy effciency measures, creating a model of and simulating the building's use of energy, as well as suggesting an appropriately dimensioned photovoltaic system for the facility. The feld of building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) was examined to be able to present a perspective of the possibilities other than a roof based building applied system, should Skolfastigheter AB plan to construct a new school dining hall. The building's total energy consumption consisted of 894 MWh in district heating and 580 MWh from use of electricity. By introducing lighting-, ventilation- and comfort cooling control systems, as well as replacing old windows, the buildings energy consumption could be reduced to 712 MWh, a reduction of 764 MWh/year. Which would bring the building below the requirements the Swedish national board of housing and planning (boverket) has set as a standard for newly constructed buildings.

An important reason why PV is still not the main source of electrical energy for these people is the uncertainty that comes with installing a PV system on the roof of a house. Consumers are afraid that an investment in a PV system will cost them too much money, while it will take a long time before their investment is paid back for. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate the energy yield of PV systems before installation. By doing so, consumers will be more likely to see the benefits of a PV system, thus implementing the technology on their houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This thesis aims to improve the accuracy of the annual energy yield estimation using LiDAR data and a new model for the albedo component of irradiance. LiDAR has been used to determine the irradiance on a surface previously, however, this thesis uses LiDAR data in the Unity 3D game engine, which enables the user to apply changes and build on the environment rapidly. This eliminates the disadvan- tage of LiDAR data, which is often outdated, thus missing crucial objects surrounding the location of the potential PV system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ray-casting is used extensively to determine the sky view factor, view factor, shading factor and to determine the surfaces visible to the PV module. Being able to determine the sky view factor without doing any field work greatly reduces the time required to design a PV system.&lt;br/&gt;The albedo component is often neglected entirely when estimating the irradiation on a surface, while it may significantly contribute to the energy yield, reaching up to 10% of the total. The albedo com- ponent is mainly important for highly tilted PV modules or BIPV. The albedo component is also crucial for bifacial PV modules. Measurements have shown that the albedo of a material is not determined easily using a sample of the material along with two inversely installed pyranometers making up an albedometer. It has been found that the albedometer is only able to determine the specific albedo of a location for the weather condition and the time in which the measurement has been done. Extensive research has been done in order to determine the factors which have an influence on the albedo of a location. The spectral reflectivity of materials is expected to play an important role in finding a final model which describes the albedo factor accurately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to estimate the irradiance due to reflectance, first the irradiance on the surfaces that are visible to the PV module are estimated one by one along with the view factor of each of the visible surfaces to the PV module in question. Finally using the reflectivity of the material of each surface, the contribution of each surface to the irradiance on the PV module as a result of reflectance is summed up resulting in the albedo component of the irradiance. The same method is used for the back side of the PV module to determine the irradiance on the back side of a bifacial PV module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to play an important part in the automation of PV system design, striving to com- pletely eliminate necessary field work, while improving the accuracy of the predicted annual energy yield.",2017,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tudelft.nl,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/TY2BXY76/Sönmez - 2017 - An albedo irradiance model usable for bifacial PV .pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/L8S5TJZZ/uuid9c619b7e-ea37-4f78-afd9-ccbfcc28ff9d.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are a great many software programs to choose from, each of which is best suited to deal with specific tasks in various stages of project implementation. Many of the solar-oriented simulation tools, however, lack building energy modelling capabilities and vice versa. Thus, there is no “magic pill” to solve all the problems that BIPV practitioners’ face, while also no supporting guideline exists for choosing the appropriate software models to be employed in particular cases. Lack of awareness about principles underlying the selection of appropriate simulation strategies underline the perceived need for a comprehensive guideline that will facilitate the identification of “fit for purpose” BIPV performance prediction methods. By setting up parsimonious (fit-for-purpose) models, practitioners will be able to create simulations that are just complex enough to resemble the given BIPV system for reaching the goals set. This research project combines modelling and simulation with experimental activities in the SolarBEAT test facility as input for development of a guideline for appropriate selection of BIPV performance prediction methods. By identifying and translating the needs from practice and developing a reliable decision-support guidance, we will shed light on questions of how simulation tools can help to get more objective information in order to support design, installation, research and sales. Through an integrated approach which combines investigating factors in decision-making with technical aspects, such as exploring uncertainties in BIPV yield prediction, we will develop a guideline that is capable of providing guidance regarding which inputs and settings are the most critical to model accuracy, how detailed should the model be in order to pursue the stated objective, and which simulation tools are well-suited for addressing certain kinds of problems.",08.11.17,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,,,,,,,Performance prediction of BIPV,,,,,,,en,,,,,www.narcis.nl,,"Publication Title: 9e Editie Sunday / Onderzoek Ontmoet Praktijk, 8 November 2017, Bussum, Nederland",,,,,Building performance simulation; Solar energy; BIPV; Decision support system framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, the Energy Simulation Software Pleiades+Comfie (P+C) was employed for the global Dynamic Thermal Modeling of the building. Thus, the P+C software served as a reliable tool for the modeling of the electrical production from the installed PV panels. In order to estimate the performance of this model, its accuracy was compared to that of an optimized solar irradiation model (Matlab), built from literature references. A description of the ADREAM building is provided, along with the methodology of the two simulations. The simulated results of PV energy production were compared to measured data.

J.",Data Analysis for installed PV Systems in the Netherlands,,,,,http://essay.utwente.nl/72080/,"In a more energy demanding world, solar energy may be an important key player in achieve a secure, cheap and clean energy source. Abundance of solar irradiance around the world allows utilizing this source everywhere. This fact is linked with the effort of CO2 emission reduction by nations, by reducing the impact of energy generation emission by conventional (fossil fuel based) generators. Transportation systems also may turn into a sustainable or no-­‐emission (CO2) actor. Also, solar PV energy is reaching attractive economical benefits, reducing the prices on the technology itself and reducing prices of energy generation, competing with traditional fossil fuel based sources. Even in some countries the price from PV power plants is already lower then thermal units. As a significant number of countries around the world, the Netherlands is experiencing a strong expansion in the PV technology market to achieve benefits as mention above. Total installed capacity it has been doubling for past two years and in 2013, the capacity was about 722 MWp. This growth of PV systems requires reliable and accurate information about their performance to allows net operators to manage increasing levels of PV generation into distribution grid to forecasting it capacity and look forward to storage options. The present report focused on data analysis of roof mounted PV systems around the area of Utrecht, Rotterdam, den Bosch and Amsterdam, in the Netherlands looks forward providing more analysis and information about existing systems. The received data includes information as total system, module and inverter capacity, brand, tilt and orientation per installed system. It also includes solar irradiation data from the KNMI and METEO-­‐SAT system, in Watt per square meter in an hourly average value. Main aim of the analysis was to describe the existing PV systems in the mentioned areas and compare them by calculating the performance ratio (PR). Also comparison of possible differences between the multiple brands of PV modules and inverters as possible seasonal variations too were analyzed. Received systems data was analyzed and filtered using the programming language Python. The filters applied to the raw data included eliminating NaN and infinite values. Calculated PR was then filtered by minimum solar irradiation value to avoid distortions in PR value during sunrise and sunset. Finally, the analyzed systems were filtered by PR interval between 0.25 and 1.6, dropping the systems with values out of this interval. Two PR systems samples were created, utilizing KNMI irradiation values and a second with METEO-­‐SAT irradiation values. Results of the analysis showed most common configuration of the PV systems concerning their technology (modules material), orientation, size of the systems and configuration giving also an insight about current status and capacities of BAPV installed in the Netherlands and the average performance of those systems.",06.02.17,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Internship report,,,,,Publisher: University of Twente,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/AECNPPVU/72080.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D8J6PDX8,conferencePaper,2017,"Saretta, Erika; Bonomo, Pierluigi; Frontini, Francesco",Active BIPV glass facades: current trends of innovation,,,,,https://repository.supsi.ch/9044/,"On the path towards the implementation of nearly zero-energy buildings, as stated by the European Commission, the integration of photovoltaics technology in buildings (BIPV) has been proven to be very interesting in order to achieve the energy goals. In detail, the use of glass BIPV modules is constantly improving due to the fact that they can replace almost every conventional material of the building envelope and they can actively contribute to the building energy balance. But, is the transfer of PV in architecture only a matter of energy? Certainly not. Along with the multifunctionality of the building skin, BIPV today involves a new aesthetics in contemporary architecture. Thanks to innovative possibilities in glass development and customization for BIPV solution, a wide range of architectural languages arises in current applications, ranging from the visible semantics of solar cells to the technological mimicry. The aim of this paper is to describe the current researches and trends of innovation in the use of BIPV glass for building facades, through the discussion of some pilot case studies collected by the Swiss BIPV Competence Center (www.bipv.ch) in the framework of different projects. Moreover, this study will create a platform for a primary discussion aimed to describe the innovative factors concerning the technological transfer of the PV glazing elements in the built environment.",2017-06,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,02.Jul,,,,,,Active BIPV glass facades,,,,,,"Tampere, Finland",,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/NF3RJY7U/9044.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GPD Glass Performance Days 2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, solar technologies have not been widely used in the built environment, limiting their operation to industrial and macroscale applications. Commercially available products such as building integrated PV panels (BIPV) or building integrated solar thermal collectors (BIST); and novel prototypes and concepts for solar cooling integrated facades are seen as interesting alternatives for the development of new performance based façade components for high-performing commercial buildings. However, there are barriers to overcome in order to promote widespread application of architecturally integrated solar components. The present paper seeks to discuss perceived barriers for widespread façade integration of solar technologies, in order to define the current scenario and generate guidelines for future developments. In order to achieve this, the paper presents the results of a survey addressed to professionals with practical experience in the development of façade systems for office buildings, situated at any stage of the design and construction process. Hence, architects, façade consultants, system suppliers and façade builders were considered. The outcome of this study is the definition of the main perceived barriers for façade integration of solar technologies, discussing the results from the survey along with other related experiences found in the literature.This study is part of the ongoing PhD research project titled COOLFACADE: Architectural integration of solar cooling strategies into the curtain-wall, developed within the Façade Research Group (FRG) in the Green Building Innovation programme (GBI) of the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft.",2017,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,51-62,,1,,,,Solar façades,,,,,,,en,,,,,tubiblio.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de,,Number: 1 Publisher: IOS Press,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/5QDG6KR9/105671.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D2KGCJE3,thesis,2018,"Erenchun Gutierrez, Juan Ignacio","Sizing, simulation and comparison of a Building Integrated and a Building Attached Photovoltaic system",,,,,https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/7671/,"This thesis project presents the design, simulation and comparison of two different configurations of a photovoltaic system installed on an office building in Santiago, Chile. One is a BAPV type consisting of mono-crystalline modules used as Sun shields on the north facade windows and also mounted on the roof facing the same direction, an installed power of 488.4 [kWp] is calculated. The second is a BIPV system with mono-crystalline semi-transparent modules on the windows and opaque panels on the walls and the same roof installation as the other case, results in 885.87 [kWp] installed. The same model of three-phase inverter is used, but 9 are required in the first case and 15 in the latter.   The estimation of the demand profile is performed using the software EnergyPlus and OpenStudio, based on the Reference building model for a large office building developed by the DOE of the United States. After modifications to adjust the internal loads, an annual consumption of 4,200.8 [MWh] is obtained. This value does not present considerable variations when the solar modules are added. The simulation of the generated power is performed on an hourly basis for a 25-year period using MATLAB R2017a, based on the radiation data provided in “Explorador Solar” by the Ministry of Energy of Chile. An annual production of 1,036.1 [MWh] is obtained for Sun shield and 1,788.0 [MWh] for Curtain wall.  For the Sun shield there is injection to the grid on the weekends, since during the weeks the consumption is higher, for Curtain wall there is also generation surplus during weekdays in summer. In both cases the energy self-consumed reduces the requirements to the system resulting in a peak-shaving effect due to the coincidence of the demand profile and the sunlight hours. The Sun shield configuration has a higher annual yield and reference yield, of 2,121.4 [kWh/kWp] and 2,583.2 [h], while in Curtain wall are 2,018.4 [kWh/kWp] and 2,312.0 [h]. The performance ratio is lower, 82.1 % compared to 87.3 % of the latter.   An economic analysis is performed, and it is concluded that the Sun shield configuration is profitable with an NPV of 575.000 [USD] and a payback time of 5 years, while Curtain wall is not economically viable with NPV of -1,711,700 [USD]. The initial investment is 545,362.09 [USD] and 4,297,745.67 [USD] respectively but in the second case it is reduced about 30 %, to 2,990,252.70 [USD], due to savings related to the conventional components being replaced. It is noted that the periodic costs for cleaning the modules take special importance for Curtain wall because they are charged by square meter and the installed area is much bigger in this case, 5,274.67 sqm compared to 2,664.71 sqm.",16.07.18,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,20.07.21 15:58,,140,,,,,,,,,,Politecnico di Torino,,it,cc_by_nc_nd,laurea,,,webthesis.biblio.polito.it,,,,"/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/JN9PUMAI/Erenchun Gutierrez - 2018 - Sizing, simulation and comparison of a Building In.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/GIVX7A4J/7671.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the BIPV market is still a niche market, representing only 1% of the global PV share. One of the main barriers that hinder the deployment of BIPV is the lack of aesthetic flexibility. Architects and designers are often reluctant to embed PV systems in buildings due to their unsuitable color.&lt;br/&gt;In this thesis, the use of interference filters (IFs) as color coating solution for PV modules is proposed. IFs are optical devices designed to selectively reflect a narrow portion of the visible solar spectrum while transmitting the remaining part. The structural coloration provided by the filter is highly dependent on the angle of incidence of the light. This angular dependence could be an issue for BIPV applications, since color homogeneity is often an important requirement. The objective of this work is to model, fabricate and assess the opto-electrical performance of colored crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV modules based on interference filters, with the final goal of increasing the aesthetics of this technology.&lt;br/&gt;First, the angular resilience challenge is addressed. Simulation results show that texturing the glass surface significantly improves the color stability, thanks to diffuse reflection of light. Very high angular resilience up to 80º can be achieved with a double-side texture profile made of hemispherical grooves. Secondly, five interference filters deposited on different glass substrates are used to fabricate 10 x 10 cm² c-Si colored mini-modules. The optical characterization of the demonstrators&lt;br/&gt;allows to partially validate the optical model and confirm the good angular resilience of the textured surfaces. Finally, the electrical performance of the mini-modules is evaluated. I-V measurements show that IFs only affect the short-circuit current of the mini-modules due to optical losses. Depending on the color and the topology of the surface, absolute efficiency losses range from 0,95% to 4,6%.",2018,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tudelft.nl,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/46YR657G/Villa - 2018 - Colored PV modules based on Interference Filters.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/YCNSP2EM/uuid3a1c078d-f9e0-4817-8758-a0b56a14bf18.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has increased public interest in and development of building integrated&lt;br/&gt;photovoltiac (BIPV) systems. One such BIPV solution is the PowerWindow by Physee. Even though the PowerWindow&lt;br/&gt;does not produce asmuch power as a traditional rooftop installed photovoltaic solution, it can still&lt;br/&gt;be viewed as a step in the right direction to achieve sustainable development.&lt;br/&gt;This thesis project aims at modelling the energy yield of the PowerWindow by developing a simple framework&lt;br/&gt;with optical, thermal and electrical models. This thesis also evaluates the electrical characteristics of the&lt;br/&gt;PowerWindow under solar simulators. Furthermore, opto-electronic parameter values like current, voltage,&lt;br/&gt;reflectance and so on found through experimentation are used as input to the models. The optical model&lt;br/&gt;deals with a ray tracing approach to find the incident irradiance on the solar cells inside the PowerWindow.&lt;br/&gt;This incident irradiance along with the weather data is used for the development of a thermal model to predict&lt;br/&gt;the temperature of the solar cells using a fluid dynamic approach. To model the electrical characteristics&lt;br/&gt;of the PowerWindow, a one diode equivalent circuit is used. However, the current source is modified to incorporate&lt;br/&gt;the effects of inhomogeneous irradiation on and the temperature of the solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work show that the maximum power produced by the PowerWindow, currently manufactured&lt;br/&gt;by Physee, is approximately 3.5 W under a solar simulator. This work also compares the incident&lt;br/&gt;irradiation profiles of all the edges of the PowerWindow, which produce power on different days, orientations&lt;br/&gt;and locations. The effects of shading on the PowerWindow is evaluated in terms of irradiation and is found&lt;br/&gt;to be present only in the summer months in Eindhoven. Furthermore, the daily energy yield calculated for&lt;br/&gt;a typical summer, winter and overcast day in Eindhoven is found to be 13, 5 and 3 Wh. It was concluded&lt;br/&gt;that a west and east facing PowerWindows in Eindhoven produce more energy in the summer and less in&lt;br/&gt;the winter as compared to a south facing PowerWindow. Additionally, the most performance effective circuit&lt;br/&gt;configuration is found to be the one with both blocking and bypass diodes.",2018,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tudelft.nl,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/9PIBJNDH/Sharma - 2018 - Modeling the Energy Yield of The PowerWindow.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/5NAMAW6A/uuidc26a5edd-5c45-4e1a-bc1c-22b745be19fb.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It evaluates the performance of identical and commercially available glass/glass BIPV-elements installed in outdoor test sites at different climatic environments. These c-Si test-modules resemble those modules built in the façade of an existing reference building in Linz, Austria, and are mounted reproducing similar boundary conditions. The reference BIPV façade is currently under operation and has been monitored for more than 10 years. In total, the experiment involves 9 participants from 7 countries in Europe and Asia. Accorded monitoring method and constructive boundaries allow for the analysis of the influence of geographical and climatic conditions on the performance of the BIPV elements and can be related to the pre- and post-installation measurement results under STC conditions in a reference lab. From the experimental design of this work, it is possible to compare the performance results of a commercially available type of glass/glass BIPV elements installed in the façade of a building with those installed and monitored in outdoor-sites and measured under laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the reliability results under natural ageing conditions (high rise building with BIPV façade) are compared to those obtained after accelerated ageing in the laboratory. At this point, (incomplete) monitoring data of only six modules could be used for the first analysis.

Business tycoons are introducing electric vehicles which fascinates people. However, there is yet a stabilized solution to be found for charging electric vehicles with green energy on the basis of large scale implementations. In the Netherlands, there are more bikes than the total population and with the number of e-bikes increasing every year it would be brilliant to charge the e-bikes with decentralized renewable energy than with the conventional way of purchasing energy from the grid. In this thesis such a charging facility called the Solar Mobility Hub is studied thoroughly and validated for performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By validation, it means the system was tested for the number of e-bikes it can charge throughout the year as an autonomous system without loss of load. Instead of going into complete modelling a different approach was pursued. E-bike ride programs were conducted for a few months with the help of volunteers from which technical data necessary to develop exclusive full year load profiles were obtained. Thereby, generating two kind of load profiles - work to home (commute mode) and bike sharing (sharing mode). It was found that the solar mobility hub was capable of charging 19 e-bikes as a 100 % reliable autonomous charging infrastructure for commute mode and 15 e-bikes for sharing mode. Furthermore, advanced simulations were performed with system modifications like change of PV array tilt and increased battery bank. Finally, a performance analysis on the system was conducted and the reasons for the variation in performance were analysed. Furthermore, improvements and suggestions necessary for making such a BIPV commercially successful are provided.",2018,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,,,,,,,Analysis on the Solar Mobility Hub,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tudelft.nl,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/NETDKDGW/Francis Rozario - 2018 - Analysis on the Solar Mobility Hub a technical ap.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/DM4EH84N/uuidf729e7dc-e05c-4ac7-a57d-e2a435200133.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since conventional PV is typically installed in optimal conditions, some limitations especially in existing urban areas (shading, non-optimal orientation, etc.) are still seen as a “no go” rather than as boundary conditions, which can be optimized through design and technical solutions. Such restrains include architectural, typological and construction aspects, both at urban and building level, along with economic/financial and legislative/normative issues.

VT9BDI73,journalArticle,2018,"Garg, Shiwankar",Developing a BIPVT: Building Integrated PV-Thermal System,,,,,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A18e9d987-9343-458c-a007-36b587ae3d42,"Photovoltaic Technologies in recent years have gained immense attention owing to reduced costs and increasing efficiencies. While decades of research in Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) technologies, producing thermal and electrical energy simultaneously have brought these costs further down, improving a system’s overall performance. PVT collectors consist of PV modules with a thermal absorber bonded/attached underneath them. Excessive solar radiation that is not converted into electricity by the panels is released as heat, causing their temperatures to rise. Rising PV panel temperatures have an adverse effect on their efficiency, particularly for building integrated photovoltaics, that generally lack sufficient ventilation for this heat release. Thermal absorbers for PVT systems, are designed specifically for absorbing the excess heat generated by PV modules. In practise, helping the panels perform better by effectively removing the heat present behind them, with the help of a heat transfer fluid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has been a collaborative effort between the TU Delft, and Exasun BV, a solar panel manufacturer located in the Netherlands. At Exasun, the project has also benefited by being a part of a larger consortium project, the PVT inSHaPe, currently underway at the Solar Energy Application Centre (SEAC), in Eindhoven. PVT inSHaPe aims to realise zero energy buildings by integrating PVT systems with heat pumps alongside effective thermal storage. As a manufacturer, Exasun BV specialises in state of the art building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV). BIPV systems aim to integrate photovoltaic technologies seamlessly into building facades. In doing so, they forego essential thermal ventilation required for maintaining lower panel temperatures. Thus, a novel BIPVT design was developed in-house at Exasun, for extracting the excess heat of panels, and utilising it to match the domestic hot water and space heating demand for Dutch households.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple thermal model for concentrating PV-Thermal collectors, currently under development at the TU Delft was validated alongside widely used steady-state and quasi-dynamic thermal models. Individually calculated thermal efficiencies from the models were juxtaposed, with the simple thermal model recording an error of 1.65% against the steady-state model, and an error of 9.21 % against the quasi-dynamic model. Once validated, the model was used further for system characterisation and performance evaluations of the design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various technology concepts have been tested extensively. However, further feasibility, reliability and optimisation studies need to be performed, in order to test the novel, cost-effective, and relatively maintenance free design in mind. The performance of PVT systems rely on high irradiance levels from the sun, and module temperatures. As space heating demands are higher during winter months, even after heat pump integration, the system is not effective enough to match the entirety of the load demand, and must be coupled with an auxiliary (electrical) heater, that can be powered by the PV system. Presumptive performance analysis carried out for a simulated household, revealed an average thermal efficiency of 10 % for the design, while recording a combined efficiency of 36 %. The stand-alone system was able to match over 55 % of the domestic hot water demand. When combined with a heat pump, the system is able to meet roughly 80 % of the hot water demand, while it is able to match almost 40 % of the complete thermal demand for a household.",2018,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,,,,,,,Developing a BIPVT,,,,,,,en,,,,,repository.tudelft.nl,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/6RDBN8JA/Garg - 2018 - Developing a BIPVT Building Integrated PV-Thermal.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/AKJEPJ6N/uuid18e9d987-9343-458c-a007-36b587ae3d42.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3 key objectives include a 20% reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and CO2 compared to 1990 levels (and up to 80% by 2050), a 20% improvement in energy efficiency and a 20% share of basis energy consumption from renewable sources.&lt;br/&gt;On its own, the building sector is responsible for 1/3 of the world’s energy consumption, of which 60% is due to heating and cooling. In the European Union, this proportion achieves 40% of the total energy consumption, of which heating, cooling and domestic hot water account for around 70%. Fossil fuels represent 75% of the primary energy supply for heating and cooling needs whereas renewable energies account for only 18% followed by nuclear energy with 7%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brief energy context being stated, this work focused on the assessment and the optimization of a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, coupled with a building integrated photovoltaic and thermal (BIPV/T) system and a simple BIPV system. The objective was to reduce the overall energy consumption of a very well insulated dwelling aiming to make it a net zero energy building (NZEB). This HVAC system incorporated a dual-tank water-to-water heat pump (WWHP), used for space heating and cooling, using the BIPV/T system as a heat source thanks to preheated air. The dwelling is a so-called Deep Performance Dwelling (DPD) developed by the Solar Decathlon team from Canada: TeamMTL. This DPD was used as case study all along this Master thesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the one hand, this study aimed at the modelling of both integrated PV systems which were developed firstly with the MATLAB software and then with the TRNSYS software. One of the objectives was to highlight the impact of the thermal recovery from the BIPV/T system on its PV modules efficiency compared to the BIPV system. Furthermore, the same initial and boundary conditions were used to ensure a truthfulness on-site energy production from both BIPV/T and BIPV systems as well as for the validation of these systems, later integrated to the complete DPD modelling.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of various parameters on the NZEB objective and the on-site energy fraction (OEF) covered by the energy produced by the DPD. These parameters included the efficiency of the PV modules, their tilt angle, the materials used for both floors and walls as well as the size and the control strategy used of both electrical and thermal storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, even if the comparison of both MATLAB and TRNSYS modellings led to a similar net increase in the BIPV/T average electrical efficiency of + 0.0014 [-] compare to the BIPV one, the TRNSYS one achieved an 11.0% lower yearly electrical generation due to an intrinsic factor used in TRNSYS called Incidence Angle Modifier (IAM). The impact of this factor affected all the more the thermal yield, namely a reduction by 28.6% for the annual thermal production along with a 32.0% lower thermal efficiency of the BIPV/T system compared to the one modelled in MATLAB. However, given that TRNSYS was required to model the transient behaviours of the DPD, not conceivable with MATLAB due to the time constraint of this Master thesis, it was logically concluded to use the TRNSYS modelling of the integrated PV systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, to have a good representativeness of the performances of the DPD, 4 cities with very different climates were chosen. For each location, the DPD was categorized as a nearly zero energy building (nZEB). Then, the simulation results emphasized that an optimal tilt angle adapted to every location, concrete-based floors as well as high efficiency PV modules allowed for reaching the NZEB objective in 3 cities, the 4th one facing low annual irradiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to improve the energy performance of the DPD. Based on the interpretation of the results concerning both on-site energy indices and energy outputs, a better configuration than the one of the as-built DPD was suggested for each city. Indeed, the sensitivity analyses indicated that the bigger the electrical storage, the better the electrical OEF index. Then, a 300-litre hot water tank as well as a 150-litre cold water tank led to a better overall OEF index and a lower energy consumption compared to the initial configuration. These results were obtained by applying the initial control strategy relying on price benefits of the grid based on bidirectional power flows between the batteries and the grid. However, a grid-tied configuration with no more batteries-grid connection and not taking anymore advantage of incentive prices of the grid stood out an even better overall electrical OEF index, making a higher use of the on-site power generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the proportion between the on-site PV production and the amount of energy supplied by the grid to meet the demand of the DPD were calculated.

Considering that the building envelope is today one of the most complex parts of a sustainable building, the “BIM-ization” of its construction process could potentially foster the challenge of a more sustainable built environment. This is particularly relevant for multifunctional systems producing energy such as “solar skins”. Typically, today the building process is highly fragmented so that the information flow is not linear, many information is lost, are missing or need to be re-entered with additional rework and request for information. An integrated and collaborative digital process would reduce efforts, time, repetitive work, risk of mistakes, information losses, etc., transforming an almost “manual” and fragmented work into an interoperable workflow along the value chain. BIM creates efficiency and users will get several benefits. Digitalization of solar building envelopes, since it is a multidisciplinary field, requires dedicated specifications on information modelling/management, process workflows, interoperability aspects and BIM levels to adopt. The paper will present an insight on the adoption of a BIM-based approach to ensure the reduction of process inefficiencies and unforeseen clashes for the implementation of BIPV building skins. Along with a review of the existing framework concerning the definition of a reference process for the PV value-chain, it will focus on the discussion of BIM requirements for solar building envelope systems and in a first definition of the information categories for the main Levels of Development (LOD) of BIPV components. After presenting also a practical example of digitalization for a BIPV customized module, both in terms of geometrical and information modelling, the paper will finally provide basic inputs concerning approaches to support real workflows for higher BIM maturity levels in BIPV sector. The advantages of adopting a digital process and the interoperability levels will be also discussed, in order to provide inputs for the main stakeholders in improving the process efficiency and controlling costs.",2018-10,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,780-798,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/BXW9NEWN/10358.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED BUILDING SKINS 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the diverse geographic features and policy conditions in China, 12 typical cities were selected for study. Five different types of PV building applications were investigated, covering the most popular applications in China. The lifecycle economic performance of each case was then analyzed based on local geographic conditions and policies. The results show that Shanghai is currently China’s most suitable city to implement PV systems, while the implementations in Chongqing, Chengdu, Urumqi and Guangzhou are less economically viable.

Nowadays, architects are looking for additional BIPV products to design active facades with novel architectural languages. For this reason, BIPV manufacturers started to customize BIPV modules in order to meet architects and clients’ requirements. However, changing traditional front solar glass to obtain coloured PV, can influence the final module power output. Even though there are already investigations about the reduction of PV energy output due to the front glass aesthetical treatments, there are not yet clear correlations between alternative design options (glass treatments and colours) and their operative conditions as façade elements. This paper is firstly aimed at providing a systematic investigation about novel mono-chromatic BIPV products in order to identify the influence of some main design options on the electro-thermal performances of modules. Specifically, this analysis is performed by evaluating, in collaboration with a Swiss industrial partner, a range of customized mono-chromatic BIPV prototypes by means of indoor measurements and outdoor tests. Furthermore, these results have been used to preliminarily assess the electro-thermal behaviour of multi-chromatic BIPV configurations both at STC and outdoor conditions. As a result, it arises that the operative condition should be carefully considered to qualify the behaviour of multi-chromatic BIPV modules with novel aesthetical designs in order to provide reliable data about the real electro-thermal behaviour.",2018-09,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,1472-1477,,,,,,BIPV Meets Customizable Glass,,,,,,Brusselles,,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/SXMCHV6X/10274.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are thousands of highrise buildings in the world and almost all of them over time will require some degree of refurbishment. The premise of this thesis is based on the rising ecological concern of human-made climate change, and the role building industry has in its effects. The thesis only focuses on a smaller part of the whole sector, namely “curtain wall facades”. But, data suggests that the demand of curtain wall systems is rising when they age or the buildings which already have deteriorated curtain walls for over 30 years will require some degree of intervention to improve the facade quality and the performance of the building using the facade. Alternatively, the increase in maintenance costs and utility costs will render the building undesirable and hence cause premature demolition of the facade or the building itself. Although this thesis only focuses on a specific region, the postulation of this research applies to any location based on region-specific analysis and design solution.

Supported by an increasing technological development, by digitization and process innovation, such systems will progressively be implemented in the construction market allowing the achievement of the nZEB policies. BIPV products are evolving from the basic architectural integration towards multifunctional products, aggregating essential PV requirements with additional requirements from the building skin such as thermal insulation, solar control, fire safety, water tightness, etc. However, to effectively enter the building market, the BIPV products will necessarily have to respect the goal of cost-effectiveness as well as the compliance with adequate quality, safety and reliability levels. In this context, the H2020 project ""BIPVBOOST"" is focused on obtaining a reduction in costs along the entire value chain by pursuing product and process innovation, thus supporting the BIPV implementation in a wider mass market of the built environment. In addition to a technological development, it is essential to solve the interconnection between PV product standards, construction industry standards and specific rules for the installation and use in buildings. The EN 50583-1:2016 and EN 50583-2:2016 made a first step in this direction by defining the properties and the applicable regulatory framework for PV systems modules used as construction products. Nevertheless, the current regulatory framework collects norms created for standard PV or, on the other hand, for “non-active” building elements, so that a significant progress regarding BIPV qualification is still needed, and it represents a current barrier for the market access. It arises the need to identify new “multi-disciplinary” reference requirements, to improve the definition of the performance levels and to develop new test methodologies better suited to the use of PV in the building skin. Therefore, these issues will be addressed within the project by identifying the gaps in the current standards and by implementing a performance-based approach for the qualification of BIPV products. The paper, summarizing the first investigations of the project, will provide an overview on the current normative framework, reporting the main missing gaps and a roadmap to define new reference procedures for BIPV products qualification, setting the basic ground for next developments in the coming years.",2019,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,,,,,,,PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF BIPV SYSTEMS,,,,,,Marseille,,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/IB2UYIZD/11333.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EUPVSEC 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a full year energy prediction, additional performance parameters (e.g. NOCT) have been introduced but have left room for improvement. The newly IEC 61853 norm defines a Pmpp-matrix with 7 settings of GPOA and 4 settings of Tmod, which enables an accurate yield calculation for a specific climate. In our contribution, this GPOA-Tmod-matrix is used for understanding and comparing various PV technologies. In total five visualization and statistical tools have been demonstrated. i) The Pmpp-matrix in colorplot can reveal potential performance issues during specific moments of the year. ii) The significance of each bin to the full year yield is visualized with colormaps of the number of datapoints, irradiation and specific yield. iii) Adding statistics per bin enables cleaning the measurement data from outliers that are common in 24/7 outdoor field data (like shading, power cuts, etc..). iv) Increasing the bin sizing of both the GPOA- and the Tmod-axis improves the visibility of small performance trends. v) Plotting other module parameters (like VOC, Vmpp, ISC, Impp, FF, AOI, IAM) in the same matrix representation is of great help to give a physical explanation to the observed performance phenomena. Finally, the PR-matrix is presented with an additional filter showing only bins that contribute more than a threshold value (e.g. 0.5%) to the total yield. All these visualizations and tooling was applied on the BIPV round-robin module of Task15E. The PR-matrix shows a remarkable (too) low PR for the lowest row of irradiance bins with GPOA=100 W/m2. With the aid of the AOI-matrix this has been attributed to shallow angles of sunlight that are most prominent in these bins. More use cases are presented in which various PV-technologies have been compared side by side. A c-Si and a CIGS-module in a BIPV-façade in the Netherlands have about the same full year DC PR. However, the PR-matrix, showed two distinct effects. On another rack mount setup, the comparison of the PR-matrix of an in-house developed IBC (mini-) module and an n-PERT module also showed very distinct effects in the PR-matrix, whereas the full-year-round PR of both technologies are very competitive and hides all the interesting phenomena.",,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,20.07.21 15:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,www.narcis.nl,,,,,,,BIPV; Façade; Bifacial; CIGS; Energy / Geological Survey Netherlands; Energy Efficiency; Energy Performance; Energy Rating; PV Module,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper investigates the behavior of BIPV modules when integrated in high-rise buildings. The focus is on thermal aspects, including the annual temperature distribution and the equivalent temperature, the latter representing the cumulative effects of thermal degradation. The openIDEAS environment and a validated BIPV model are used to simulate the building thermal conditions and to obtain the BIPV (cell) temperature and power output. Five different locations with diverse climatic conditions are considered: Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), Seville (Spain), Naples (FL, USA), Cape Town (South Africa), and Munich (Germany). The results have shown that both temperature distribution and equivalent temperature vary significantly among the locations, with Riyadh and Seville having the highest temperature while Munich and Cape Town the lowest. Furthermore, little difference was observed between equator-oriented and west/east orientations of the BIPV modules for all locations. Finally, wind effects seem to have an important impact on both equivalent temperature as well as energy yield.

3M4497HT,thesis,2019,"Chialastri, Andrea","Testing, Optimization and Design of a BIPV/T Solar Air Collector",,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PhDT........56C,"Integrated building elements, which combine their structural, control and architectural functions with that of energy generation, are expected to become increasingly important in the future scenario of energy efficient buildings, and they could significantly contribute to the thermal behavior of the building envelope in order to provide energy savings. A prototype of a building-integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) solar air collector was built, consisting of a double-glazed airflow window wall with photovoltaic (PV) louvers embedded in it. The collector is intended to either be used as a modular window wall unit that would form a ventilated double-skin facade, or as an independent airflow window, and it provides combined heat and power generation, while still allowing light transmission, shading control and thermal insulation as a conventional window.In this work, the prototype's thermal and electrical performance have been tested, and the experimental data served to develop and validate a thermo-fluid dynamic model in COMSOL Multiphysics. This served as a first reference model and starting point to build more expanded 2D models, as well as to develop 3D models of some portions of the window, which were used for optimization and design by editing the prototype’s features, such as geometrical layout, material properties and operational parameters. CFD simulations were used to enhance PV cooling and thermal insulation, in order to optimize both the thermal and electrical efficiency. The optimization of the glazing system, frame heat losses minimization and several strategies for PV-to-air heat transfer enhancement are discussed. These included parametric analysis of the effects of airflow rate and glass spacing on PV temperature and thermal generation, the use of extended surfaces and a new layer structure of the PV absorbers. The field measurements on existing prototype determined a maximum temperature rise of 31 °C and average thermal and electrical efficiency of 31% and 7%, respectively. The optimization showed that significant increases in air temperature rise and thermal efficiency by up to 70% and 60%, respectively, as well as up to 25% decrease in PV temperature can be achieved. Lastly, the design of new prototypes in SolidWorks, which were developed based on the simulation results, are presented.",01.01.19,20.07.21 16:00,20.07.21 16:00,20.07.21 16:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Publication Title: Ph.D. Thesis,,,,,Energy; Electrical engineering; Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supported by the increasing technological development, by digitization and process innovation, such systems will progressively have to be implemented in the ordinary construction market allowing the achievement of the demanding energy policies for nZEB buildings. These BIPV products are evolving from the only function of architectural integration, intended as an aesthetical element capable of producing energy, towards multifunctional products that can aggregate many features required for the building skin such as thermal and acoustic insulation, solar control, safety in case of fire, etc. However, to effectively enter the building market, the BIPV products will necessarily have to respect the goal of cost-effectiveness on the entire production chain as well as the compliance with adequate quality, safety and reliability requirements. In addition to a technological development, it is essential to obtain a specific interconnection between product standards, industry standards and specific rules for the type of installation and use in buildings. The EN 50583-1:2016 and EN 50583-2:2016 standards made a first step in this direction by defining the properties and the applicable regulatory framework for photovoltaic modules used as construction products. Nevertheless, the current regulatory framework collects norms created for standard PV or, on the other hand, for “non-active” building products, without proposing new testing procedures specifically adapted to BIPV. Consequently, significant progress regarding BIPV systems qualification is still needed, which represents a current barrier for a mass market deployment. From the current regulatory framework, very often not sufficient for addressing a proper BIPV performance assessment and validation, it arises the need to identify new “multi-disciplinary” reference requirements, performance levels and new test methodologies better suited to the use of PV in building skin. Therefore, a possible path for addressing these issues will be addressed within WP5 of the project by identifying the gaps in the current standards related to BIPV and by developing a new performance-based approach for the qualification of BIPV products. This deliverable will provide an overview on the current normative framework, including the definition of some relevant missing gaps in relation to reference requirements and a roadmap to define new reference procedures for BIPV products qualification, as the basic ground for next developments in the coming years.",2019-09,20.07.21 16:00,20.07.21 16:00,20.07.21 16:00,,,,,,,,,,,,EU H2020 Project,,en,,Report,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,"/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/G3NRD8U2/Bonomo et al. - 2019 - Standardization, performance risks and identificat.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/PTNTY46P/11685.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Community Solar as a Business Model for Building-Integrated Photovoltaics,,,,,https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/258009/,"A currently pertinent research challenge is to find ways to keep the growth rate of solar power at a high level. The adoption of new technologies, such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), but also new and innovative business models such as community solar, have both been identified as relevant drivers. However, the adoption of BIPV is still encountering numerous barriers that hinder its more widespread deployment within the solar PV market. The goal of this research effort was to assess whether community solar as a successful business model for the adoption of conventional solar PV could be equally promising in relation to the further adoption of BIPV. For this purpose, we conducted an experimental survey (n=413) to compare customers’ willingness to buy a community solar offer exclusively associated with BIPV to a community solar offer solely designed with conventional rooftop solar PV. Our results revealed no significant difference between willingness to buy based on our experimental treatment (BIPV vs. conventional PV), indicating that community solar can be a successful distribution channel for the further adoption of BIPV. As findings about specific business models for BIPV are rare, our research creates an important foundation upon which policy makers and project developers can build.",2019-09,20.07.21 16:00,20.07.21 16:00,20.07.21 16:00,,,,,,,The Beginning of a Beautiful Relationship?,,,,,,Marseille,en,,,,,www.alexandria.unisg.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/SZMWZ38E/Stauch and Vuichard - 2019 - The Beginning of a Beautiful Relationship Communi.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/XHRDEMK7/258009.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EU PVSEC 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IEA Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme  (PVPS) is one of the technological collaboration programmes (TCP’s) on research and development within the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA PVPS has been established in 1993, and participants in the programme have been conducting a  variety  of  joint  projects  regarding  applications  of  photovoltaic  (PV)  conversion  of  solar  energy into electricity.  The mission of the PVPS is “...to enhance the international collaboration efforts which accelerate the  development  and  deployment  of  photovoltaic  solar  energy  as  a  significant  and  sustainable renewable energy option...”. The underlying assumption is that the market for PV systems is gradually expanding from the niche‐markets of remote applications and consumer  products  to rapidly growing ones for building‐integrated and centralised PV generation systems.  Building-Integrated PV (BIPV) is seen as one of the five major tracks for large market penetration of  PV,  besides  price  decrease,  efficiency  improvement,  lifespan  and  electricity  storage.  The  IEA PVPS  Task  15  focuses  on  the  international  collaboration  to  create  an  enabling  framework  to accelerate  the  penetration  of  BIPV  products  in  the  global  market  of  renewables.  Its  aim  is  to create  an  equal  playing  field  for  BIPV  products,  BAPV  products  and  regular  building  envelope components  that  careful  consider  mandatory  requirements,  aesthetics,  reliability  and  financial aspects. To reach this objective, an approach based on 6 key developments has been established, focussed  on  growth  from  prototypes  to  large-scale  producible  and  applicable  products.  The  key developments  comprise  of  dissemination,  business  modelling,  regulatory  issues,  environmental aspects and demonstration sites.  This  Task  contributes  to  the  ambition  of  realizing  zero  energy  buildings  and  built  environments. The  scope  of  this  Task  covers  new  and  existing  buildings,  different  PV  technologies,  different applications, as well as scale difference from 1-family dwellings to large-scale BIPV application in offices and utility buildings.

It produces electricity from a 110.5 kWp building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system where heat is also recovered from a section of the array and used to preheat the outdoor air intake. The building's many architectural and mechanicalfeatures were integrally designed to achieve the net zero energy target over a five-year averaging period with several key decisions made at the early design stage. These include the shape, area, and orientation ofthe roofthat maximizes electricity productionfrom the BIPV (part BIPV/T [building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal with heat recovery]) system and a design layout that promotes daylight penetration and natural ventilation/free coolingduring the cooling season. In thefirstyear after inauguration, an operational energy use intensity (EUI) of 24.8 kBtu/tfy (78.1 kWh/m2y) was achieved and has since been reduced to 22.20 kBtu/fy (70.0 kWh/m2y). Considering renew-ables production, the net-energy use intensity (EUI) is 4.60 kB tu/ fi2y (14.5 kWh/m2y). This is a 95% EUI reduction over the national institutional average and can be further reduced with additional (ongoing) commissioning efforts. Suggested improvements in operation include ensuring the electricity production is optimized and any faults corrected, dimming electric lighting when daylight is sufficient, extending the hours of natural ventilation, and better utilization of the hydronic radiant slab for thermal storage using predictive controls.

It goes beyond focusing only on PV modelling and gives an overview of the BIPV tools from the perspective of BIPV integration in design and multi-performance modelling and planning. The report examines features and functions, as well as potential development and limitations of currently available tools used in BIPV planning process, including tools specifically designed for BIPV and PV tools with capacity to simulate certain BIPV cases. Moreover, report provides information on limitation and reliability of these tools in different settings and for different BIPV categories, indicating pathways and tools’ selection that would provide the highest confidence and fidelity of results as well as positive user experience throughout the process. The report streamlines workflows according to the type and complexity of BIPV integration and offers pathways and tools suitable for required case. The report included 15 domains of BIPV planning such as geophysical, technical, economic and environment which affect successful BIPV integration. 27 software, 9 online tools and 4 apps were compared against the aforementioned domains. The findings of this review showed none of the examined software and apps can cater to all the factors pertaining to PV project design and management. Results have shown that majority of tools used in BIPV modelling come from PV domain and consequently still lack important features regarding BIPV integration, especially for vertical or externally mounted BIPV. Therefore, this study propose a decision support system which will address stakeholders’ practical difficulties by providing the main features: (1) a localized data repository which will include weather information, building regulations, energy consumptions in different building sectors, utility prices,construction and maintenance costs, contract types, financial modes, carbon prices and government incentive schemes; (2) efficient 3D model creation of the physical environment; (3) Hourly comparison of energy input and output; (4) PV layout design optimization; (5) Simulated installation process and impact analysis; (6) Monitoring and inspection modules with auto diagnosing function; (7) PV systemperformance recording; (8) sensitivity analysis and scenario-based decision making support",2019-10,20.07.21 16:02,20.07.21 16:02,20.07.21 16:02,,,,,,,BIPV Design and Performance Modelling,,,,,International Energy Agency IEA-PVPS,,en,,Report,,,repository.supsi.ch,,,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/PVMRM92Y/Jakica et al. - 2019 - BIPV Design and Performance Modelling Tools and M.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/WN4TNMFT/12051.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differences in the performance loss rates (PLRs) between module types and mounting configurations were determined by using the year-overyear methodology. The glass/backsheet module was markedly affected by the higher operating temperature: PLR changed from 0.01%/yr for ventilated to -0.42%/yr for insulated. However, the glass/glass module showed an opposite and unexpected trend: PLR changed from -0.10%/yr for ventilated to 0.26%/yr for insulated. Analysis of the IV curve parameters revealed that the decreased performance of the insulated glass/backsheet module was chiefly due to the loss in the fill factor with increased resistance; however, the gain in the short-circuit current (I sc ) was the main driver for the increased performance of the insulated glass/glass module. Real-world temperature coefficients were further examined and they were mostly found to be in line with the values measured indoors. Lower power-temperature and higher current-temperature dependence of the insulated glass/glass module, compared to the ventilated construction, supported the observed performance and current behavior of this module.",2020-06,20.07.21 16:02,20.07.21 16:02,20.07.21 16:02,1371-1378,,5,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,repository.supsi.ch,,Number: 5 Publisher: IEEE,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/DWNKTFCW/12157.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the multiplication of energy efficient buildings didn’t match with a similar trend in the BIPV market which continues to occupy a niche of both PV and building claddings.

YQH85XYH,report,2020,"Corti, Paolo; Bonomo, Pierluigi; Frontini, Francesco; Mace, Philippe; Bosch, Elina",Building Integrated Photovoltaics: A practical handbook for solar buildings' stakeholders,,,,,https://repository.supsi.ch/12186/,"The BIPV Status Report 2020 has been developed by SUPSI and Becquerel Institute. It aims to provide a practical handbook to all stakeholders of the BIPV development process, providing insights to each of these actors, although they approach the topic of BIPV from different perspectives. This handbook highlights the main steps of BIPV’s evolution, the key challenges of the sector, the necessary interdisciplinary of the activities across the whole BIPV development process as well as the economic calculation and the cost competitiveness analysis. The status of BIPV in Europe, relying on an extensive database of BIPV case studies and on an analysis of past and future market trends, is presented over the critical reflection on the main traits of its evolution along last decades. The case studies analysed, the database of products and the results from our applied research fully oriented to practice and to the real market, offer to architects inputs for new projects and references to quantify BIPV costs and advantages. Moreover, the practicality of this booklet and its infographics make it a potential tool for public authorities and educational institutions to promote BIPV and, in general, the sustainability of buildings. The economic calculation and the cost competitiveness analysis can support investors, building managers and real estate developers in taking the most economically convenient decisions. The crucial question of cost competitiveness is illustrated with data coming from the real market and built examples and is representative of the common EU building typologies and building envelope solutions.",2020,20.07.21 16:02,20.07.21 16:02,20.07.21 16:02,,,,,,,Building Integrated Photovoltaics,,,,,SUPSI - Becquerel Institute,,en,,Report,,,repository.supsi.ch,,Num Pages: 104,,/Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/UCMP6JAA/Corti et al. - 2020 - Building Integrated Photovoltaics A practical han.pdf; /Users/jmccarty/Zotero/storage/9IEIE6JE/12186.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
