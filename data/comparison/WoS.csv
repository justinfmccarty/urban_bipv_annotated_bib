This paper investigates the aesthetic and technological integration of hidden coloured PV modules in architecturally sensitive areas that seem to be the best possibility to favour a balance between conservation and energy issues. First, a multidisciplinary methodology for evaluating the aesthetic and technical integration of PV systems in architecturally sensitive area is proposed, referring to the technologies available on the market. Second, the experimental characterisation of the technical performance specific BIPV modules and their comparison with standard modules under standard weather condition are analysed, with the aim of acquiring useful data for comparing the modules' integration properties and performance. For this purpose, new testbeds have been set up to investigate the aesthetic integration and the energy performances of innovative BIPV products. The paper describes the analyses carried out to define the final configuration of these experimental testbeds.

In this sense, the so-called Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is a possible catalyzer, as PV is hidden (integrated) into building envelope morphologies that are familiar to the public. It is crucial to be able to design and assess a BIPV system so that its visual performance is optimal. Many studies exist in this regard, but still they do not deliver a clear theoretical organization of the concepts used for defining the visual performance of BIPV. This paper elaborates a trans-disciplinary systemic formalization of BIPV and proposes a vocabulary focusing on the formal perception of BIPV as a part of the building's envelope system. The proposed vocabulary is based on a set of 11 visual keywords; as the proposed method unifies the formal and the cognitive information contents. It will facilitate the dialogue among different stakeholders (e.g., architects, clients, modules manufacturers, and public authorities) and, in general, the visual performance assessment of BIPV.

When photovoltaic modules are integrated into a building, architectural design considerations compete with maximizing photovoltaic energy production. As a result, BIPV arrays are often not facing south and are frequently mounted vertically. Under these conditions, a greater portion of the total sunlight striking the array is diffuse or at high angles of incidence. In northern latitudes a significant amount of the total yearly energy is produced at low light levels. A grid-connected array of BIPV modules integrated into the BCIT Technology Centre building in Burnaby, B.C. was used for assessing the accuracy of an energy performance model developed for BIPV systems. The BIPV system uses AC modules and a computerized data acquisition system for monitoring the performance of modules and inverters. The performance model was developed from analysis of the open circuit voltage, maximum power point voltage and maximum power point current of the individual modules comprising the BIPV array. The algorithm for calculating power output of the photovoltaic array is derived from the ideal diode equation using the single diode model of a photovoltaic cell. An empirically derived parameter modifies the equation. Once the parameters for different module technologies are established, it is possible to compare their annual performance in a BIPV system, (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The detailed calculation, including the mathematical formulas used at each stage, is explained. First, the position of the sun is calculated. Second, we calculate the daylight availability. Our third calculation is of sun and sky illuminance on the ground and vertical facade. This is followed by the calculation of reflected light. As a result, indoor illuminance can be calculated. In the section of results and discussion, theoretical simulations are accomplished with parametric tools. In the comparison, results from the simulation and the calculation are matched, especially in the case of the overcast sky. By these means our approach can be proved effective.

Likewise, the same uncertainty affects the economic aspects, objects of this paper, since BIPV systems are often evaluated similar to conventional installations. The typical consequence is to neglect their added value such as the multifunctionality of the system and therefore showing limited advantages of BIPV. Scope of this paper, starting from a multicriteria approach, is to outline a new methodology for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of BIPV for the building skin. This method, based on a life-cycle costing approach and on the assessment of the whole building envelope solution, is expected to support architects during the early design phase in the research of the optimal design of BIPV, synergistically taking into account both PV and building quality. A comparison with conventional building elements and different PV technologies is also presented in order to strengthen the impact of the proposed methodology.",,,,"Haas, Charles N/G-8830-2011","Haas, Charles N/0000-0002-9255-9930",,,,,,,,,,,,1751-2549,1756-2201,,,,,2017,11,1,,,,,104,129,,10.1080/17512549.2016.1161544,,,,,,,WOS:000399057600007,,,,,,

Measured data were used to analyze the performance and loss factors (module temperature, dust and soiling, power conditioning system (PCS) standby mode, direct current-alternating current (DC-AC) conversion loss). A performance ratio of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61724 was used to power the generation performance analysis. The impact analysis of each loss factor is analyzed by using difference of the power generation, the module efficiency, irradiation, and the performance ratio according to the existence of a loss factor. The performance ratio analysis result of this BIPV system shows a range of 66.8-69.5%. The range of performance loss due to each loss factor was as follows; module temperature: 2.2-6.0%, dust and soiling: 2.2-23.1%, PCS standby loss: 4.9-15.7%, DC-AC conversion loss: 4.1-8.0%.

Therefore, fossil fuel-generated electric power plants, that emit an enormous amount of greenhouse gases, can be replaced by the PV power plant. However, due to its lower efficiency than a traditional power plant, and to generate equal amount of power, a large land area is required for the PV power plant. Also, transmission and distribution losses are intricate issues for PV power plants. Therefore, the inclusion of PV into a building is one of the holistic approaches which reduce the necessity for such large land areas. Building-integrated and building attached/applied are the two types where PV can be included in the building. Building applied/attached PV(BAPV) indicates that the PV system is added/attached or applied to a building, whereas, building integrated PV (BIPV) illustrates the concept of replacing the traditional building envelop, such as window, wall, roof by PV.

However, up until now, there have been limited studies that analysed cost-benefit and risk factors/barriers of BIPV from a supply chain perspective; and there have also been limited studies that provide strategies to industry and academics in order to encourage BIPV diffusion and application. The aim of this research is to identify the costs, benefits and risks of BIPV and propose suggestions for greater BIPV application, from a stakeholder perspective, through a comprehensive review of current literature. The results of this research show that whilst BIPV have high initial investment capital costs, there are significant long-term benefits to be achieved for clients, end users and the entire society. Further, the results also show that BIPV costs decrease and government policy support and incentives are required in order to promote wider BIPV application. In addition, this research has identified the fact that there was a lack of detailed BIPV cost data (including individual component costs) and lack of methods for BIPV cost-benefit analysis, and there are risks and barriers in BIPV applications. Following this, this research provides a strategic framework and a number of suggestions to industry stakeholders for integration and collaboration within the BIPV supply chain in order to facilitate the cost reduction of BIPV. Finally, this study proposes several topics for future research.

There are two categories of cooling mechanisms, i.e. passive and active cooling. In the present study, a simplified numerical model is set up to evaluate the effect of passive cooling of BIPV facades with various configurations, including the PV periphery openings (i.e. area ratio), behind air cavity depth, wind velocity and attack angle (0 to 90 degrees) on the cell temperature of BIPV module. A parametric study is performed. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is applied to predict the cell temperatures under various BIPV facade configurations and environmental conditions. The results of the CFD model show that in the case where the areas of the top and bottom openings are equal, there is limited air ventilation at the behind air cavity. However, the BIPV surface temperature has a significant drop when the inlet opening at the bottom is enlarged, compared with that of the same area of inlet and outlet. Changing the wind attack angle from 0 degrees to 60 degrees has limited effect on the BIPV cell temperature, which results in a variation of less than 5 degrees C. However, a dramatic temperature drop of around 15 degrees C is observed when the attack angle is larger than 60 degrees. The influence of air cavity depth is studied with the fixed top and bottom opening size ratio. By varying the air cavity depth from 30 to 200 mm, a lower PV cell temperature can be achieved.

As part of the EU's 2020 targets, it is aimed to reach a 20% share of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption by 2020, according to EU's renewable energy directive. Within this context national renewable energy targets were set for each EU country ranging between 10% (for Malta) and 49% (for Sweden). A large share of renewable energy research has been devoted to photovoltaic systems which harness the solar energy to generate electrical power. As an application of the PV technology, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems have attracted an increasing interest in the past decade, and have been shown as a feasible renewable power generation technology to help buildings partially meet their load. In addition to BIPV, building integrated photovoltaic/thermal systems (BIPV/T) provide a very good potential for integration into the building to supply both electrical and thermal loads. In this study, we comprehensively reviewed the BIPV and BIPVT applications in terms of energy generation amount, nominal power, efficiency, type and performance assessment approaches. The two fundamental research areas in the BIPV and BIPVT systems are observed to be i) improvements on system efficiency by ventilation, hence obtaining a higher yield with lowering the panel temperature ii) new thin film technologies that are well suited for building integration. Several approaches to achieve these objectives are reported in the literature as presented in this paper.

However, the energy demand of existing buildings (and energy retrofit measures) and the potential RES production have been generally considered as separated disciplinary fields so far. Conversely, a synergic and integrated approach can be more efficient in terms of time and/or costs and can bring to novel urban energy strategies and policies enhancing the energy retrofit rate and the integration of photovoltaic in buildings (BIPV).

Despite the progress in BIPV modelling, the use of sensitivity analysis (SA) is still scarce in the BIPV literature. SA can help the modeller to identify which model inputs influence the model outputs the most. This paper presents a simulation framework that combines global SA methods with a multi-physics BIPV model. The analysis focuses on the performance of naturally ventilated BIPV facade elements (cell temperature and power). Building performance indicators, such as the total heat flux to the building interior and the building wall temperature, are also analysed. Inputs to the SA include convective heat transfer coefficients, cavity airflow rate, and weather conditions. As expected, the SA results were found to be highly dependent on the range selected for the inputs. For a narrow variation in weather conditions, the exterior convective heat transfer coefficient was identified as the input with the strongest influence on the BIPV performance.

This can lead to high energy losses if not considered adequately. This paper presents a BIPV modeling and optimization method which uses a parametric 3D modeling tool, coupled to a high-resolution ray-tracing irradiance simulation and an electrical model based on the single diode model on a subcell level. With the use of a genetic algorithm, electrical interconnections of the modules are optimized for maximum yield. The presented approach allows the simulation and optimization of BIPV in urban environments where complex shading occurs and high electrical mismatch of photovoltaic cells and modules is to be expected. It allows specific geometric design and optimization of photovoltaic installations and their electrical layout. The electrical simulation is validated for both flat and curved thin-film CIGS modules, as well as for two connected thin-film CIGS modules under deferring irradiance and partial shading conditions. The presented method is further applied in a case study on a double-curved roof shell. The results show that by using genetic algorithms the layout can be optimized to minimize the string mismatch losses for BIPV networks with a variety of modules. The detailed electrical simulation allows to quantify effects of module designs and inverter concepts on the system performance. This is demonstrated for the case study, indicating that thin-film modules with longitudinal cell direction outperform modules with orthogonal cell direction by up to 8%. Furthermore, module-integrated bypass diodes show little benefits for the best performing module technologies.

Although there may be many circumstances that bring about cracks in BIPV modules during the installation process, identifying the degradation of PV module efficiency resulting from the effects of cracks tends to be a very difficult task unless actual indoor or outdoor tests or detailed electroluminescence imaging tests are conducted. Many current studies have demonstrated that cracks may or may not impact the output performance of PV modules depending on the damage levels or where the damage is located. For BIPV applications such as replacement for building materials, there is still a lack of information and case studies addressing crack issues in a quantitative manner for evaluating BIPV output performance. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of cracks in BIPV modules on power outputs and to identify detailed relationships between the cracks and power output based on experimental and simulated analysis. An experimental facility located in Daejeon, South Korea, was used to gather data from cracked and non-cracked BIPV modules. By using the field-measured data and facility' information, a simulation model was developed using SolarPro software, and a simulated-based analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of cracks in BIPV modules on output values after proper validation of the model. The results from this study reveal that cracks in BIPV modules exhibit significant degradation in BIPV modules' outputs of up to 43% reduction during the experimental period. From the annual comparative results, output degradations of 34.6-35.4% were estimated when the BIPV modules included cracks.

BIPV and BAPV turn the present and future buildings (high rise or low rise) into power stations with the introduction of photovoltaics either in the facade (90 degrees wall) or roof (flat or pitched) configuration. But one of the significant challenges that influence the energy performance is the dust accumulation. This is a serious issue in the places where air pollution is very high. Addressing this would be very difficult for the human workforce, and the complexity and tediousness would increase depending on the size of the BIPV and BAPV array or the height of the building. Currently, there are few dust cleaning robots which could offer services in addressing the soiling issues in conventional photovoltaic installations. The existing dust cleaning robots (DCR) could not offer a better feasible solution in BIPV and BAPV as they offered in traditional PV systems that were installed in an open area. Hence for addressing dust cleaning issue, some novel conceptual schemas related to robot developments were proposed in this paper considering the installation configuration of PV systems for building applications. Here, DCR's for three configuration of PV installation with building applications namely BIPV/BAPV facade, BIPV/BAPV horizontal roof, and BIPV/BAPV pitched roof are dealt. The proposed conceptual robots were briefly described with the schematic views highlighting operation, energy consumptions, and slipping issue etc. Scope for the development and various research challenges that are to be considered during the design stage are highlighted along with the discussion.

Besides the discrepancy between the physical dimensions of the converters and the desired installation location, thermal and electrical measurements on a prototype BIPV curtain wall element reveal that daily energy losses can be as high as 50% due to thermal overload when used in a moderate climate such as Belgium. The paper concludes by discussing further standardization of BIPV module-level converters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In fact, by knowing the BIPV potential, urban decision makers can support the integration of PV in the urban environment with appropriate policies to achieve energy transition goals. Specifically, to assess urban BIPV potential of facades, not only solar radiation algorithms are required but also the identification of construction facade characteristics, which significantly affect the real BIPV exploitability. However, current urban BIPV facade cadastres generally do not considered such characteristics since the majority of them are based on 3D city-models at LOD2, meaning that the influence of architectural elements (such as windows, balconies, etc.) is not evaluated. Therefore, this work proposes a calculation method capable to match existing solar radiation analysis at LOD2 with architectural characteristics of facades, through building typological indicators, in order to better estimate the urban BIPV potential of facades, namely defined as LOD2.5, without the need of LOD3 models, which involve important investments at urban level.

To overcome this drawback, it required to maintain the operating temperature at standard test conditions. The working temperature of the BIPV can be kept at a higher efficiency end by the usage of phase change materials (PCM). However, the heat transfer rate of conventional PCM is very poor and can be enhanced by using thermal conducive nanoparticles. The present study has been effectuated to show the effect of various nanoparticles on the operating temperature of the BIPV. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis taking into cognizance the heat and mass transfers in a system made of a nano-enhanced PCM attached to the back of a BIPV has been conducted. The n-octadecane has been considered as base PCM material which is mixed with four different nanoparticles at three different concentrations. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3), Copper (Cu), Copper oxide (CuO), and Titanium dioxide (TiO2), have been used as the nanoparticle to augment the thermal conductivity of PCM. The result showed that the addition of nanoparticle in an appropriate amount considerably reduced the operating temperature of BIPV for a longer duration of time. The maximum temperature reduction is obtained with Cu nanoparticle and minimum with TiO2. The panel temperature can be maintained below 40 degrees C for about 60 min. with Cu nanoparticles at 5 % concentration. At the same concentration, Cu will take maximum time i.e. 56 min. to melt completely.

Experimental prototypes of one-inlet and two-inlet BIPV/T systems were constructed for conducting comparative experiments. Variations of BIPV/T systems are also investigated including systems employing opaque monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) panels and systems employing semi-transparent mono-crystalline PV panels. Experimental results demonstrate that an equivalent two-inlet system with frameless PV panels can increase the thermal efficiency by 5% compared to a conventional one-inlet system, and that the BIPV/T system with semi-transparent PV panels achieves 7.6% higher thermal efficiency due to the absorption of some solar radiation at the bottom surface in the BIPV/T system cavity. Also, the two-inlet BIPV/T design is easily implemented and does not add significant cost. Detailed air temperature measurements reveal that the mixing of the warm outlet air from the first section and the cool ambient air drawn in from the second inlet contributes to the improved performance of the two-inlet system. Based on a thermal network model of the BIPV/T system and experimental data, correlations are developed for the convective heat transfer coefficients in the two sections.

The selected cities are Stavanger in Norway, Bern in Switzerland, Rome in Italy, and Dubai in the UAE. The study showed that for all the studied climates, the average incident radiation on the entire building skins is slightly more than the average incident radiation on the east or west facades, regardless of the orientations of the building facades. Furthermore, the correlation between solar radiation components and different BIPV technologies is discussed in this paper. It is also found that when it comes to the efficiency of different BIPV cells, the impact of the climate on some of the BIPV technologies (such as DSC and OSC) is much more significant than others (such as c-Si, mc-Si and CIGS). The evidence from this study suggests that in climates with higher diffuse radiation-or with more overcast days per year-the contribution of IR radiation decreases. Therefore, the efficiency of BIPV materials that their spectral responses are dependent on the IR radiation (like Si and CIGS) in such a climate would drop down meaningfully. On the other hand, the DSC and OSC solar cells could be a good option for cloudy climates since they have more stable performance, even in such a climate.

The paper aims at evaluating the impact of the operating cell temperature on the modules' performance for different investigating cases. Two models were used to calculate the junctions' temperatures of the modules under operation: the simplified Nominal Operating Temperature (NOCT) model and the Equivalent Cell Temperature (ECT). The first was used in a simplified version and the second was used for all modules, regardless of its limitations for thin film technologies. The two models agree well and give satisfactory results regardless of the inclination, integration solution or technology. The difference between the NOCT and ECT calculated average daily temperatures of the modules was found to be less than 5-6 degrees C, with only one exception. As expected, fully integrated modules exhibit higher temperatures. In terms of performance, the integrated c-Si modules, regardless of their inclination, ranked lower - in terms of energy yield - than the integrated and ventilated a-Si/a-Si modules, for which the high operating temperatures proved to be beneficial.

Although the BIPV technology has been in the public domain for the last three decades, its adoption has been hindered. Existing literature asserts that proper information and education at the proposal or early design stage is an important way of addressing adoption barriers. However, there is a lack of BIPV communication approaches for research, and market proposals that focus on clear information about its benefits. This has limited the adoption of BIPV.. Based on this, the present study aims to develop a conceptual framework for an educative-communication approach for presenting BIPV proposals to encourage its adoption. This is aimed at developing holistic research and market proposals which justify scholarly investigation and financial investment. Using a multiple case study investigation and Design Research Methodology (DRM) principles, the study developed an approach which combines core communication requirements, the pillars of sustainability and a hierarchical description of BIPV alongside its unique advantages. A two-step evaluation strategy involving an online pilot survey and a literature-based checklist, was used to validate the effectiveness of the developed approach. Our results show that understanding environmental and economic benefits was found to be significantly important to people who are likely adopters of BIPV (p < 0.05), making these benefits crucial drivers of adoption. Statistical significance was also found between those who do not know the benefits of using solar energy for electricity, and interest in knowing these benefits (p < 0.05). We thus conclude that proper communication of these benefits can safely be advanced as important facilitators of BIPV adoption.

The system uses solar photovoltaic electricity generated by the building skin to produce hydrogen for fuel-cells, which in turn, when converted to energy in fuel cells, may be used to supply additional power to the building (or fuel cell vehicles) when solar power is not sufficient, for example at night or in periods of low insolation. Electricity generated from 8.2 kW(p) BIPV array optimally supplies the electrolyser near the maximum power point level of the BIPV array. To further optimize hydrogen production, the electrolyser is connected to the local electrical utility, and DC power is provided to the electrolyser through a custom on-board DC power supply that supplements the BIPV array. Performance of the complete installation is optimized to provide continual production at the optimal efficiency level of hydrogen production at constant power. The results obtained from the system operation have shown excellent voltage and current regulation during operation of the electrolyser. The project shows the potential for development of similar building integrated hybrid systems elsewhere with possibilities for inclusion of additional renewable energy sources and added functionality.

Due to the high installation location, BIPV modules suffer from lightning hazard greatly. In order to evaluate the risk of lightning stroke and consequent damage to BIPV modules, the studies on the lightning attachment characteristics and the lightning energy withstand capability are conducted, respectively, based on numerical and experimental methods in this paper. In the study of lightning attachment characteristics, the numerical simulation results show that it is easier for the charges to concentrate on the upper edge of the BIPV metal frame. Therefore, the electric field strength at the upper edge is enhanced to emit upward leaders and attract the lightning downward leaders. The conclusion is verified through the long-gap discharge experiment in a high voltage lab. From the experimental study of multi-discharge in the lab, it is found that the lightning interception efficiency of the BIPV module is improved by 114% compared with the traditional PV modules. In the study of lightning energy withstand capability, a thermoelectric coupling model is established. With this model, the potential, current and temperature can be calculated in the multi-physical field numerical simulation. The results show that the maximum temperature of the metal frame increases by 16.07 degrees C when 100 kA lightning current flows through it and does not bring any damage to the PV modules.

The varying testing conditions render a direct performance comparison of the various systems difficult, while the convective phenomena may exhibit significantly different behavior depending on the system type and size. Additionally, different expressions used to model wind-driven and channel convection may introduce significant uncertainty in the predicted performance of such systems. These inconsistencies in both the monitored and modelled performance contribute to a reduced confidence in such systems and a resulting small number of realized applications.

Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), which is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide currently, refers to photovoltaic cells that are integrated into the building envelope such as facade or roof to generate clean energy from sunshine and is the most remarkable technology to contribute to nZEB purposes. In this paper, an innovative approach of BIPV economic analysis is presented. The proposed method is to quantify the societal and environmental advantages of a BIPV system as much as possible and import these values to the economic analysis in order to see their effects in a lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA). In order to compare the results with the current LCCA, four case studies from Brazil, Italy, China, and Bahrain were chosen, because they were the most recent BIPV system LCCA, and the suggested method was applied on them. The economic analysis showed that with the societal and environmental benefits of the implemented system, replacing conventional facades and roof building materials with BIPV modules will become economically more feasible. As a result, the presented strategy could not only expectantly guide the end user to decide more conscious about the implementation of BIPV systems but also steer governments or decision-makers to support the technology by rational subsidies and incentives.

Maximum annual performance of grid-connected PV is usually obtained with modules tilted at an angle equal to the site latitude, facing the equator. The performance of PV systems not tilted and oriented ideally can drop considerably, depending on site latitude. With grid parity when the cost of solar electricity becomes competitive with conventional electricity expected in many countries in the present decade, a more widespread application of PV on buildings is expected, and in this context the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that good compromises between form and function are possible. In this work we compare the annual energy generation of a curved BIPV system installed as a car port rooftop, with an ideally-oriented and tilted, flat BIPV system installed as a building's rooftop cover at a low-latitude site (27 S). For the one-year period analysed, the curved-shape BIPV system annual yield was 12% lower than that of the reference BIPV system, and during the summer months (November to February), the curved BIPV installation presented a higher energy yield than the latitude-tilted generator. With these results we show that a good compromise can be reached between form and function in BIPV systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, the use of solar energy, as a viable way to deal with the pollutant emissions caused by ships, has been attracted considerable attention. However, considerable investment costs, high area demands, and low performances of ships equipped with the photovoltaic systems have until recently been some of the significant challenges in the use of solar energy in the shipping industry. This paper proposes a novel method for the optimal performance of ships through the simultaneous optimisation of the hull-propulsion-building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system. Using the proposed method, the interaction effects among the ship hull, the BIPV system, and the propulsion system, as well as the impact of the wind and ship speeds on the BIPV system efficiency are considered. Ship operational conditions, including the sunshine duration, the clearness index, the ambient temperature, the latitude of the region, the view factor of the sky to ground, the wind and ship speeds, and the ship lifetime hour are also examined. Moreover, a probabilistic speed profile is employed to avoid a suboptimal design at a single ship speed. The performance of the suggested method is evaluated by designing a planing ship equipped with a waterjet propulsion system that operates in the Karun river, Iran. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem of a planing hull-waterjet-BIPV system. Eight cases are compared to demonstrate the effectiveness and the promise of the proposed approach in different ship design problems with different displacements and BIPV area-to-deck area ratios. The results show the high performance of the adopted approach in cutting operating costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Based on the results, the investment costs due to the BIPV system have been recouped within a year in different studied cases and scenarios. It is also found out that the interaction effects among the ship hull, the BIPV system, and the propulsion system are important to ensure the optimal performance of a ship.",,,,"Gholami, Hassan/AAA-8976-2021","Gholami, Hassan/0000-0002-7835-6774",,,,,,,,,,,,0196-8904,1879-2227,,,,OCT 1,2019,197,,,,,,,,111879,10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111879,,,,,,,WOS:000487165700018,,,,,,

Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are systems used to utilise the unused spaces that can be installed on the facade or roof by replacing the building's main element. However, the main problem associated with electricity production by BIPV is partial shading on the roof, which can produce multiple hot spots and disturbances to the system if the insolation values within the whole BIPV array vary. Partial shading, in this case, is observed due to the complexly shaped roof. This paper studies the partial shading effect on one of Qatar's most recent projects (metro stations), and models the Education City station, which is a major station. The rooftop is complex, and it has many wavy shapes that can affect the BIPV system's performance. The station is modelled using building-information modelling (BIM) software, wherein all of the station's models are gathered and linked using BIM software to illustrate the BIPV and indicate the solar insolation distribution on the rooftop by simulating the station's rooftop. The system is optimised for maximum yield to determine the optimal configuration and number of modules for each string using a genetic algorithm. The outcomes from the algorithm are based on clustering the solar insolation values and then applying a genetic algorithm optimisation to indicate the optimum BIPV array layout for maximum yield.",,,,"Al-Ghamdi, Sami G./AAH-6959-2020; Ellabban, Omar/A-6860-2013","Al-Ghamdi, Sami G./0000-0002-7416-5153; Ellabban, Omar/0000-0002-1340-0332",,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,SEP,2020,13,17,,,,,,,4470,10.3390/en13174470,,,,,,,WOS:000570327900001,,,,,,

To increase the energy efficiency level, form factor (FF) is proposed as a helpful tool that provides a strong relationship between the exposed surface areas and the treated floor area (TFA). This research aims to develop a methodology for a parametric study to determine the related balance between the TFA and the required BIPV area in the form enclosure to meet specific primary energy demand (SPED) according to the international Passive House standard (PHS). Therefore, various form types, including square, rectangle, L, and T shapes, derived from four modular cubes, are classified based on the same FF. Optimal form selection per group is conducted through BIPV potential evaluation for the exposed surfaces in six different orientations separately. Thereafter, the BIPV efficiency level for the optimized forms is examined using its utilization factor and coverage index scenarios based on the facade and roof combination priorities. The results indicate that the generated energy sufficiency is affected by the form configuration and its orientation. Additionally, the optimal BIPV-based FF value of 0.71 implies the priority of roof-based scenarios for less BIPV utilization.

The results revealed that by a discount rate of zero, BIPV system could refund all the investment even on the north facades while in terms of traditional building envelope materials as an alternative option for building skins, there would be rarely added benefits after investment. Furthermore, the societal and environmental benefits of a BIPV system in Europe have its greatest impact on the south facade.

The temperature characteristics that improve the output of a BIPV system have rarely been studied up to now but some researchers have proposed a method using a ventilator. The efficiency of a ventilator depends mainly on the weather such as wind, irradiation etc. Because this cooling system is so sensitive to the velocity of the wind, it is unable to operate in the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT) or the standard test condition (STC) which allow it to generate the maximum output. This paper proposes a cooling system using thermoelectric elements to solve such problems. The temperature control of thermoelectric elements can be controlled independently in an outdoor environment because it is performed by a micro-controller. In addition, it can be operated around the NOCT or the STC through an algorithm for temperature control. Therefore, the output of the system is increased and the efficiency is raised.

The third strategy involves storing the energy from the BIPV/T collector heated air in an ice-slurry latent storage tank that is coupled with a water source heat pump.

BIPV comprises building envelope elements (wall, facade, fenestration) of PV while BAPV comprises PV applied on/in building elements. The uniqueness in this configuration lies in PV system design requiring maximum exposure to solar insolation, while building elements are designed to control and regulate solar exposure. PV performance is primarily governed by its output and efficiency, while building performance is primarily governed by its passive climatic-response, indoor thermal comfort and energy consumption. Integrability is a methodology evolved to aid in assessing a BIPV/BAPV configuration for its integrated building-PV performance. Tropical regions are gifted with ample sunny days, but due to the heat from the sun traditionally buildings have relied on high thermal-mass, shading devices and natural ventilation. However, with low-thermal mass in PV, its integration in buildings as BIPV results in high heat gain and loss, while integration as BAPV results in shading and altered building-heat transfer mechanisms. The current paper investigates the applicability of BIPV and BAPV, adopting the evolved integrability methodology, for tropical conditions, with Bangalore as case-study.

However, the potential of building facades for the BIPV system, especially in urban areas, is often neglected. Facade-mounted building integrated photovoltaics could contribute to supply the energy demand of buildings in dense urban areas with economic feasibility where the availability of suitable rooftop areas is low. This paper deals with the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) in the capitals of all the European member state countries plus Norway and Switzerland and presents a metric to investigate a proper subsidy or incentive for BIPV systems. The results showed that the average LCOE of the BIPV system as a building envelope material for the entire outer skin of buildings in Europe is equal to 0.09 Euro per kWh if its role as the power generator is considered in the economic calculations. This value will be 0.15 Euro per kWh if the cost corresponding to its double function in the building is taken into the economic analysis (while the average electricity price is 0.18 Euro per kWh). The results indicate that the BIPV generation cost in most case studies has already reached grid parity. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that on average in Europe, the BIPV system does not need a feed-in tariff if the selling price to the grid is equal to the purchasing price from the grid. Various incentive plans based on the buying/selling price of electricity from/to the main grid together with LCOE of the BIPV systems is also investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,MAY,2021,14,9,,,,,,,2531,10.3390/en14092531,,,,,,,WOS:000650164900001,,,,,,

In BIPV systems the air gap is responsible to cool the PVs and remove excess heat to avoid building overheating. The ventilation of the air gap can be natural or mechanical. However, naturally ventilated systems are less studied although they have important advantages over the mechanically ventilated ones, such as the avoidance of extra energy of the fans, maintenance and noise. The present Part I of this study presents an experimental based thermal analysis of a naturally ventilated vertical BIPV system. A series of experiments on a custom made BIPV system were carried in real outdoor conditions as well as indoors with the use of a large scale solar simulator to measure the thermal characteristics of the system and its thermal behaviour. Indoor experiments were performed to avoid external disturbances from wind that may occur outside. The results show that an open-ended air gap of 0.1 m can create adequate air flow on naturally ventilated systems and can ensure low PV temperatures to avoid PV efficiency decrease. The experimental data are then used to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficients to fit the real conditions of the BIPV systems.

More importantly, we have taken optical parameters of the cells in different sun wavelength spectra on the front and back side of the cell because optical response at each wavelength affects differently on the energy conversion efficiency of the cell and thermal properties of BIPV windows.

On average, both the installed peak power and the energy generation density were found to be higher for BIPV (100% and 87%, respectively), while the final annual energy yield was 7% higher for BAPV.

To represent the large number of possible climatic and design scenarios, the advanced technique of Latin Hypercube Sampling was firstly utilized to reduce the number of investigated scenarios from 13,338 to 374. Then, a high-resolution validated full-scale 3-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) microclimate model was developed for modelling of BIPV's cell temperature, and then was applied to model all the reduced scenarios. A nonlinear multivariable regression model was afterward fit to this population of 374 sets of CFD simulations.

This analysis was performed through long-term monitoring of performance for 2 years. Electrical energy generation per unit power output was estimated through the 2 year monitoring of an actual BIPV system, which were 48.4 kWh/kWp/month and 580.5 kWh/kWp/year, respectively, while the measured energy generation data in this study were almost half of that reported from the existing data which were derived by general amorphous thin-film solar cell application. The reason is that the azimuth of the tested BIPV system in this study was inclined to 50 degrees in the southwest and moreover, the self-shade caused by the projected building mass resulted in the further reduction of energy generation efficiency. From simulating influencing factors such as azimuth and shading, the measured energy generation efficiency in the tested condition can be improved up to 47% by changing the building location in terms of azimuth and shading, thus allowing better solar radiation for the PV module. Thus, from the real application of the BIPV system, the installation of a PV module associated with azimuth and shading can be said to be the essentially influencing factors on PV performance, and both factors can be useful design parameters in order to optimize a PV system for an architectural BIPV application.

Its popularity is due to its contribution towards zero-(or even plus) energy buildings. In urban cities where the buildings have limited rooftop area but large facade areas, adopting semi-transparent BIPV windows is an alternative for conventional windows. The semi-transparent BIPV windows not only solely generate electricity but also affect the buildings' electricity usage through daylighting and heat gain/loss. In tropical climates where it is hot and humid all year round, the importance of window facade elements is even more pertinent due to high cooling load from the solar heat gains. This paper examines the life cycle environmental and economic performance of commercially available semi-transparent BIPV modules for window application under the tropical conditions of Singapore. Energy simulations, previously performed, were adopted to conduct a life cycle assessment to determine the long term performance in terms of energy and carbon emissions, as well as cost considerations. The EPBT and EROEI for the modules ranged from 0.68 to 1.98 and 11.72 to 34.49 respectively. After considering government subsidies, some modules cost lower than conventional windows, while half of the remaining modules, achieved payback periods of 1.1-13.1 years. These performance indicators were used to form a decision-making tool to assist architects and building designers in the selection of BIPV modules for windows during the early design stages.

Three optical models were developed using commercial optical software, validating that the optical elements have a significant impact on the amount of light energy allowed to reach the back side of the bifacial cell. Further, an experimental validation was conducted using two commercially available films. Using a 1:1 film to PV-cell ratio, the first film demonstrated a maximum of 26.3% increase in power on the back side of the bifacial cell. The second film type allowed a maximum of 30.2% increase. Both films allowed solar energy to reach the back side of the cell over the range of incident angles that were evaluated, making it useful as a passive solar concentrator. Finally, both 2:1 and 3:1 film to PV-cell ratios were evaluated for each of the two film types. A maximum power increase of 35.1% was observed.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations can be a valuable tool for the design and analysis of these hybrid building-integrated solar energy systems while recent advances in CFD approaches and turbulence models provide a great potential for improving prediction accuracy. This study performs 3-dimensional steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations and evaluates the performance of five turbulence closure models, potentially suitable for modeling UTCs in terms of accuracy and computing cost. These models include four two-equation models (Standard k-epsilon, Renormalization Group Methods k-epsilon, Realizable k-epsilon and Shear Stress Transport k-omega) and one Reynolds Stress Model. A flat UTC under free stream approaching flow conditions and a corrugated UTC subjected to a plane wall jet flow were considered. The predicted air velocity, air temperature, and turbulent kinetic energy were compared against experimental data from the literature and those obtained using a specially designed full-scale experimental set-up in a solar simulator. The results show that although the Reynolds Stress Model can provide more detailed flow features at an increased computational cost compared to other models, it does not necessarily result in better performance. Among the two-equation models, the Renormalization Group Methods k-epsilon has the best overall performance for both cases studied while the Standard k-epsilon and Shear Stress Transport k-omega models can also provide acceptable prediction accuracy. A BIPV/T system with two PV panel arrangements across a UTC under the same coverage was investigated using the CFD models developed in the present study. It was found that BIPV/T systems integrated with UTCs can result in electrical efficiency up to 1.2% higher, for the cases considered. (C) 2012 The Authors.

These foils as a building transparent material have been drawing much more attention for the past decades. In addition, integration of amorphous photovoltaic cells with these ETFE foils is taken into account due to the low production cost and its resistance to high operating temperatures. In the present study, a Building integrated Photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) ETFE cushion roof was numerically modeled and the thermal and electrical performances of this system were obtained in two cases: the cushion with the steady state mass flow and the cushion with the air pressure regulator system. Verification of the modeling was performed by comparing the model's results with the available experimental data in the literature. The main strength of the present modeling is consideration of the air pressure regulator system in the modeling process which has not been studied yet. The result of the present study showed that the present model predicts the BIPV/T ETFE cushion performance with a reasonable accuracy and can predict the system performance under different operating conditions. The results also showed that in case of the cushion with the steady state mass flow, the power generation is 15% higher than that of the cushion with the pressure regulator system. However, the cushion with the steady state mass flow has a low net output generated power due to the high consumed power of the blower. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

PV panels of BIPV system serve as structural elements and are required to be fixed at optimum tilt angle for maximum insolation. For open fields with no obstructions, HDKR (Hay, Davies, Klucher, Reindl) model is employed effectively for calculating the optimum tilt angle. For urban areas, it is required to consider the adverse effect i.e., shading and sky view blocking of building for accurate calculation of optimum tilt angle for determining maximum insolation. This is an attempt to calculate optimum tilt angle of a BIPV panel surrounded by buildings of different heights which are located at different radial distances from panel by employing modified HDKR model. The present mathematical model gives accurate insolation values as it accounts both shading and sky view blocking effects.

Both systems are coupled with small size Wind Turbines (WTs), to reduce the fluctuations of power production typical of solar systems. A case study is presented, referred to a hotel building, where a reversible air-to-water Heat Pump (HP) is used for space heating and cooling, driven by the electric energy provided by PV collectors and WTs. In order to optimize the HP performance in cooling mode, thermal energy is recovered from the HP desuperheater and used to produce domestic hot water (DHW). A two-stage cascade cycle HP for DHW purposes was also investigated, as a further alternative. The systems were simulated by means of a dynamic simulation model, developed in TRNSYS. The results show that the BIPV-based system is more profitable than the BIPVT one, achieving a simple payback period of about 4.5 years; for both systems, the optimum size of the WT system, for a given area of PV collectors, was also investigated.

For this purpose, the spatial structure, of the PV system including the PV modules and the surrounding obstacles is taken into account on the basis of virtual reality environment. In this study, chimneys which are located on the residential roof-top area are considered to create the effect of shading over the PV array. The locations of PV modules are kept stationary, which is the main point of this paper, while comparing the performances of the configurations with the same surrounding obstacles that causes partial shading conditions. The same spatial structure with twelve distinct PV array configurations is considered. The same settling conditions on the roof-top area allow fair comparisons between PV array configurations.

The performance of any given BIPV system is dependent on prevalent meteorological factors, site conditions and system characteristics. Investigations pertaining to the performance assessment of photovoltaic (PV) systems are generally confined to either controlled environment-chambers or computer-based simulation studies. Such investigations fall short of providing a realistic insight into how a PV system actually performs real-time. Solar radiation and the PV cell temperature are amongst the most crucial parameters affecting PV output. The current paper deals with the real-time performance assessment of a recently commissioned 5.25 kW, BIPV system installed at the Center for Sustainable Technologies, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The overall average system efficiency was found to be 6% for the period May 2011-April 2012.

In this context, efficiency and availability of a PVPP have to be checked continuously. The section of a PVPP which deserves more attention is surely the PV array, where many fault conditions can happen (shading, by-pass diode faults, cable interruptions, and so on). A diagnostic tool to detect faults in the PV array is desirable, even if its implementation is critical owing to: the fluctuation of the operating conditions (mainly irradiance), which complicates the instantaneous response investigation and costs and implementation constraints to implement a distributed (at PV module level) or semi-distributed (at string level) monitoring/diagnostic system. Particularly, for BIPV systems, further constraints related to the regular access for inspection and maintenance operations have to be considered. In this paper, the procedure adopted to develop and validate a diagnostic tool can be summarized in four steps: (1) using real data to model the PV array; (2) introducing several fault scenarios on the real PV string and analyzing the relative modifications of the I-V curves; (3) assessment of the meaningful parameters useful to discern the different faults by means of a PV generator (PVG) simulator based on a metaheuristic technique denominated ABC-DE; (4) proposition of several fault signing tables to assess the PV plant fault diagnostic.

In case of rack-mounted PV installation, the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT) method could be effectively used to predict the temperature of the module for various environmental conditions. Many countries, for esthetic purposes, offer economic advantages (tax deductions, incentives, etc ... ) for the installation of building integrated photovoltaic modules (BIPV), with water-tightness capability and adequate mechanical resistance in order to substitute tile covering or part of it. Nevertheless, poor or absent ventilation under BIPV panels could cause them to overheat and reduce their efficiency. Lack of validated predictive tools for the evaluation of BIVP energy performance could be another barrier to their widespread application. In this study, we investigated the thermal performance of PV modules installed in a real scale experimental building over a traditional clay tile pitched roof in Italy for almost one year (from August 2009 to June 2010). One PV module was rack-mounted over the roof covering with a 0.2 m air gap; the others were fully integrated and installed at the same level of the roof covering (one with an air gap of 0.04 m, the other mounted directly in contact with the insulation). Temperature and heat flux measurements for each panel, and environmental parameters were recorded. Two temperature prediction models, NoCT model and SNL (Sandia National Laboratory) model were used to predict BIPV temperature and energy efficiency so that their suitability for BIPV could be evaluated. SNL model takes into account also the wind speed. Experimental results demonstrate that even though the rack-mounted PV module constantly maintains cell temperature below that of the other full-building integrated modules, due to the presence of a higher air gap, the difference in the energy produced by the BIPV modules estimated for the entire monitoring period is less than 4%. The two predictive models, NOCT and SNL, cause the differences in predicted and calculated temperature up to 10 degrees C. However, subsequent percentage variations on the energy predicted compared to that arising from the temperature measured generally turn out to be lower than 5%. An optimization of empirical coefficients used for calculations based on the SNL method allows for the reduction of this value below 2.5%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The first one is a Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system while the second one is a wastewater (WW) Source Heat Pump (WWSHP) system. Both systems were installed at Yasar University, Izmir, Turkey within the framework of EU/FP7 and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) funded projects, respectively. The BIPV system was commissioned on 8 February 2016 and has been successfully operated since then while the WWSHP system was put into operation in October 2014. The BIPV system has a total peak power of 7.44 kW and consists of a total of 48 Crystalline Silicon (c-Si) modules with a gap of 150 mm between the modules and the wall, and a peak power per PV unit of 155 W-p. The WWSHP system consists of three main subsystems, namely (i) a WW system, (ii) a WWSHP, and (iii) an end user system. Two systems considered have been separately operated while the measured values obtained from both systems have been recorded for performance assessment purposes. In this study, a combined system was conceptually formed and the performance of the whole system was evaluated using actual operational data and some assumptions made. Exergy efficiency values for the WWSHP system and the whole system were determined to be 72.23% and 64.98% on product/fuel basis, while their functional exergy efficiencies are obtained to be 20.93% and 11.82%, respectively. It may be concluded that the methodology presented here will be very beneficial to those dealing with the design and performance analysis and evaluation of BIPV and WWHP systems.

Saidur et al., 2007). This percentage is expected to rise rapidly in the near future. Therefore, it is critical to reduce the dependance of electricity generation based on fossil fuel and substitute it by renewable energy source. Malaysia being located at Equatorial region, has great potential for harnessing solar energy. One of the proven solar energy technology is Building Integrated Photovoltaic technology or also known as BIPV. BIPV is not new in Malaysia as it was introduced into Malaysia since year 2000 but until today it still encounters many barriers for penetration into public realm especially in urban residential sector. Therefore, identification of these non-technical barriers in the Malaysian urban residential sector through public response is vital so that strategies can be drawn for more rapid diffusion of BIPV into Malaysian urban residential sector. In order to draw a framework for analysis, it is important to understand the public awareness and perception of this emerging renewable technology in Malaysia. According to Farhar, B.C.,(1996), perceptions are important because what people believe to be real is real in its consequences and perceptions and preferences are themselves facts that describe the social world in which people operate. Farhar, B.C.,(1996), also pointed out that people perceptions and preferences about energy and the environment are influenced by objectively factual information. In this research, a purposive sample of 302 Kuala Lumpur households was developed, and face-to-face interviews were conducted. Each of these interviews was undertaken with structured questionaires.

In the mathematical model, the periodic nature of insolation, ambient air temperature, BIPV cell temperature, intermittent slab temperature, and room temperature have been considered while solving energy equilibrium differential equations. The insolation values used in the model are computed by using periodic HDKR (Hay, Davies, Klucher and Reindl) model, which is based on anisotropic sky concept. The influencing parameters i.e., air changes in both rooms of the two-storied BIPV thermal system, packing factor of the BIPV panel and the thickness of slab between rooms are considered for finding the thermal performance. It is observed that the most critical day of the year i.e., on 15th May, the upper storey and lower storey of the proposed BIPV system attains the highest room temperature of 47.3 degrees C and 42.6 degrees C, respectively. The air changes in the rooms reduce the above peak temperature for making it more comfortable. The BIPV cell temperature also reaches up to 65 degrees C resulting reduction of the efficiency by 18% than that of standard test condition. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The priority is the retrofitting of existing buildings as zero-emission to improve their energy efficiency with renewable energy technologies pulling the market with cost-effective strategies. From the first age of photovoltaics (PV) mainly integrated in solar roofs, we rapidly moved towards complete active building skins where all the architectural surfaces are photoactive (Building Integrated Photovoltaics - BIPV). This change of paradigm, where PV replaces a conventional building material, shifted the attention to relate construction choices with energy and cost effectiveness. However, systematic investigations which put into action a cross-disciplinary approach between construction, economic and energy related domains is still missing. This paper provides the detailed assessment of a real multifamily building, taking into account retrofit scenarios for making active the building skin, with the goal to identify the sensitive aspects of the energetic and economic effectiveness of BIPV design options. By assuming a real case study with monitored data, the analysis will consider a breakdown of the main individual parts composing the building envelope, by then combining alternative re-configurations in merged clusters with different energy and construction goals. Results will highlight the correlation between building skin construction strategies and the energy and cost parameters by identifying the cornerstones for enhancing efficiency. The outcomes, related to the total life cost, self-consumption/sufficiency, in combination with different building design options (facade, roof, balconies, surface orientations, etc.), provide a practical insight for researchers and professionals to identify renovation strategies by synergistically exploiting the solar active parts towards lower global costs and higher energy efficiency of the whole building system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,AUG,2020,13,15,,,,,,,3827,10.3390/en13153827,,,,,,,WOS:000559063400001,,,,,,

In Algeria, some problems arise due to the high energy consumption levels of the building sector. Large amounts of this energy are lost through the external envelope facade, because of the poorness of the window's design. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the optimum BIPV window performance for overall energy consumption (OEC) in terms of energy output, heating and cooling load, and artificial lighting to ensure visual comfort and energy savings in typical office buildings under a semi-arid climate. Field measurements of the tested office were carried out during a critical period. The data have been validated and used to develop a model for an OEC simulation. Extensive simulations using graphical optimization methods are applied to the base-model, as well as nine commercially-available BIPV modules with different Window Wall Ratios (WWRs), cardinal orientations, and tilt angles. The results of the investigation from the site measurements show a significant amount of energy output compared to the energy demand. This study revealed that the optimum BIPV window design includes double-glazing PV modules (A) with medium WWR and 20% VLT in the southern facade and 30% VLT toward the east-west axis. The maximum energy savings that can be achieved are 60% toward the south orientation by double-glazing PV module (D). On the other hand, the PV modules significantly minimize the glare index compared to the base-model. The data extracted from the simulation established that the energy output percentages in a 3D model can be used by architects and designers in early stages. In the end, the adoption of optimum BIPV windows shows a significant enough improvement in their overall energy savings and visual comfort to consider them essential under a semi-arid climate.",,,,"Mesloub, Abdelhakim/AAZ-1981-2020; Albaqawy, Ghazy/AAP-4257-2021","Mesloub, Abdelhakim/0000-0002-4513-8105; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,FEB 2,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1654,10.3390/su12041654,,,,,,,WOS:000522460200372,,,,,,

A relationship coefficient f was provided whose values are compared to those from a PV array operating in a free standing mode on a terrace. A theoretical model to predict f was elaborated. According to the analysis, the coefficient f takes higher values for PV modules embedded on a roof compared to the free standing PV array. The wind effect is much stronger for the free standing PV than for any BIPV configuration, either the PV is part of the roof, or placed upon the roof, or is placed outside a window like a shadow hanger. The f coefficient depends on various parameters such as angle of inclination, wind speed and direction, as well as solar radiation. For very low wind speeds the effect of the angle of inclination, beta, of the PV module with respect to the horizontal on PV temperature is clear. As the wind speed increases, the heat transfer from the PV module shifts from natural flow to forced flow and this effect vanishes. The coefficient f values range from almost 0.01 m(2)degrees C/W for free standing PV arrays at strong wind speeds, v(w)>7m/s, up to around 0.05 m(2)degrees C/W for the case of flexible PV modules which make part of the roof in a BIPV system.",,,,,"Kaplani, Eleni/0000-0002-4987-4388",,,,,,,,,,,,0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1255-2,,,,2014,1618,,,,,,341,347,,10.1063/1.4897744,,,,,,,WOS:000346015200073,,,,,,

A more specific competitiveness analysis model is further built with the index modeling method, and the competitiveness of CIGS-BIPV products is thoroughly analyzed from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Six primary research indicators are used, i.e., safety index, building aesthetics index, economic index, energy-saving and environmental protection index, innovation index, and sales force index. The weight analysis of index modeling shows that compared with a glass curtain wall, exterior stone, and silica-based BIPV, CIGS-BIPV is characterized by high product competitiveness, acceptable cost, attractive appearance, environmental benignity, high technical quality, and certain economic benefits.

Building envelope plays a major role in influencing the impact of outdoor climate and controlling the indoor thermal conditions. In this paper, comparative analysis of indoor comfortable temperature for four different types of building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) building models in a range of climate zones in Australia was conducted using TRNSYS simulation tool. In terms of system operational mode, the four types of BIPV/T building facade systems include a building-integrated photovoltaic single-skin facade (SSF), non-ventilated BIPV/T double-skin facade (BIPV/T-DSF), naturally ventilated BIPV/T-DSF and fan-assisted BIPV/T-DSF. In addition to the operational modes of the facade systems, two types of semi-transparent PV glazing with different visible light transmittance (VLT) were respectively applied to the models as external window glazing. The numerical results showed that the naturally ventilated BIPV/T-DSF with lower VLT (27%) PV glazing maintained a relatively better indoor temperature for the hot climatic conditions compared to the other operational modes, while the non-ventilated BIPV/T-DSF with higher VLT PV glazing (37.5%) offered more comfortable indoor temperature (i.e. 20 to 26 degrees C for office hours) for the cold climates in Australia. On the other hand, the naturally ventilated BIPV/T-DSF could basically maintain comfortable indoor temperatures from 22 to 27 degrees C during office hours without mechanical systems for the peak summer times for cool temperate climates in Australia. Moreover, it was found that the thermal insulation effect of semi-transparent PV glazing hardly affected indoor operative temperature in the ventilated modes of the BIPV/T-DSF. According to the sensitivity analysis, the change of U-value of internal window of the DSF would significantly lead to the change of indoor thermal comfort in both ventilated operational modes, but very few changes for the non-ventilated DSF. The variation of cavity depth had distinct impact on the indoor thermal comfort for fan-assisted DSF but slightly affected that of other modes. In addition, the changes of opening ratio for the ventilating louvers and fan airflow rate of the DSF also had a degree of influence on indoor thermal comfort for naturally ventilated DSF and fan-assisted DSF respectively.",,,,"Fiorito, Francesco/J-6353-2016; Yang, Siliang/AAL-5901-2020","Fiorito, Francesco/0000-0002-4554-738X; CANNAVALE, ALESSANDRO/0000-0003-3704-3605; Yang, Siliang/0000-0001-6940-6752",,,,,,,,,,,,1996-3599,1996-8744,,,,FEB,2019,12,1,,,,,51,67,,10.1007/s12273-018-0489-x,,,,,,,WOS:000457480000005,,,,,,

This paper reports our investigations on the combinations of the vacuum glazing and BIPV integration. Semi-transparent photovoltaic windows can convert solar energy into electricity, but most of absorbed solar heat is transferred into indoor environment which becomes additional cooling load. The proposed vacuum photovoltaic insulated glass unit (VPV IGU) in this paper combines vacuum glazing and solar photovoltaic technologies, which can utilize solar energy and reduce cooling load of buildings at the same time. Various experiments were conducted to evaluate the thermal performance and determine the key characteristics of the VPV IGU in this study. It was found that the VPV IGU can achieve very low total heat gain coefficient (U-value) of around 1.5 W/(m(2) K) and block most of undesired solar radiation from penetrating through the window. Compared with a common double-pane glass sheet, the vacuum PV glazing can maintain the indoor environment at a relatively low temperature due to its excellent thermal insulation performance in summer. A detailed simulation study has been conducted by EnergyPlus and Berkeley Lab WINDOW. The simulation work has indicated that the cooling load can be reduced by 14.2% by a south-oriented VPV IGU compared with common glazing products while power generation is not compromised compared with normal BIPV systems.

The performance analysis shows a good overall performance ratio of 0.81. The average array yield is 3.86 h/d and - after subtracting the capture and system losses of 0.58 h/d and 0.16 h/d, respectively - the resulting final yield is 3.12 h/d averaged over all arrays. The system and array efficiencies are 11.2% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to the nameplate PV module efficiency of 13.7%. The overall inverter efficiency is 94.8%. All the results are based on irradiance measurements with calibrated pyranometers. In addition, a classification of daily irradiance is presented, dividing the days into overcast, intermediate and clear days with each high, medium and low temporal change of irradiance levels. Results show that the performance ratio is lowest for clear days with high irradiance fluctuations, due to higher capture and system losses. Despite relatively higher losses, the absolute final yields are higher for clear days. Detailed analyses with respect to the impact of shading, orientation/tilt, and PV module temperature are also presented for selected arrays. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The PV/T array consists of 25 panels. The warm air generated in the BIPV/T array is considered the source of the heat pump for thermal energy production. Coupling of BIPV/T and ASHP enables a highly efficient heating system in harsh winter conditions. Thermal energy from PV/T array could be stored in the TES (concrete slab or gravel bed beneath the floor) during day and released in night time to enhance the performance of the heat pump. It is shown that using air thermal storage to preheat the outdoor air as an inlet flow to the air source heat pump increases the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump. Consequently, electricity consumption by the ASHP decreases during night. Analytical and numerical methods are used to evaluate design parameters that influence thermal energy production, electrical energy production, heat pump COP and electricity consumed by the heat pump. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to optimize water storage tank size, assuming that the heat pump would only operate during hours of thermal generation from the PV/T array. The preliminary results show that the seasonal COP could be increased from 2.74 to a maximum value of 3.45 for direct coupling of BIPV/T+ASHP without the use of diurnal thermal storage. The heat pump electricity consumption is reduced by 20% for winter. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The BIPV/T system is composed of multiple PV/T air collectors integrated into the building facade and connected to an air handling unit (AHU) to control the air flow. The system operates with two applications, an application for cold weather and an other for hot weather. In cold weather, the BIPV/T system recovers heat from the PV modules to preheat the outdoor fresh air. While in hot weather, the cool air exhausted from the conditioned spaces of the building is used to decrease the PV cells temperature, instead of ambient air as in conventional PV/T air collectors. An experimental tests were conducted to see the effect of using the cool exhaust air as coolant for the PV cells instead of ambient air. In order to predict thermal and electrical performance of each PV/T air collector under real climatic conditions, a theoretical model of a single pass PV/T air collector was developed and validated against experimental observations from previous literature. The theoretical and experimental comparison between the case of using exhaust air as coolant and the case of using ambient air as coolant showed an important decrease in PV cells temperature. The maximum decrease value in PV cells temperature obtained from the simulation is 9.46 degrees C in a selected day from August, while the electrical simulation showed that the average increase value in electrical efficiency in a selected day from August is 0.350.

Precedent studies on the BIPV Trombe wall system were focused on two major types, one with PV cells attached to glass (BIPVGTW) and the other with that attached to mass wall (BIPVMTW), characterized by low thermal (BIPVGTW) and electric efficiency (BIPVMTW). This study presents a PV blind-integrated Trombe wall system (BIPVBTW). Adopting developed models on the BIPVBTW, the optimum PV blind slat angles over three seasons (summer, winter and mid-term seasons) and time of day (9:00-17:00) are investigated. Comparative assessment of the three BIPV Trombe wall systems are conducted all year round under Hefei weather conditions, in terms of thermal and electrical performance. The results have illustrated that annual electricity output of BIPVBTW system is similar to that of BIPVGTW system, which is 1.2 times that of the BIPVMTW system. The BIPVGTW system is superior to the BIPVBTW/BIPVMTW systems in cooling load reduction, while using PVBTW/PVMTW heating load is decreased significantly compared to using the PVGTW. Combining electricity generation and cooling/heating load reduction, the total electricity saving of BIPVBTW system is over 45% higher compared to BIPVGTW/BIPVMTW systems.

The PV system covers an area of 59 m(2) (36 PV panels) and was installed on a roof titled by 25 degrees and facing 225 degrees (45 degrees west of south). The panels are cleaned by sweet water every 2 months and it requires around 500 l of the water for the total panels installed on the roof each cycle (i.e. 14 l/Panel). The records show that the annual generated solar electricity from this system (8.64 kW) in 2015 was 8879 kW h and the expected energy set by producer (Petra solar) was 11,990 kWh while it was expected to be 13,485.7 kWh (according to NREL PVWatt Calculator) and 14,137.0 kWh. These results indicate that the installation produced solar electricity less than the expected by 26.0%, 34.2% and 37.2%, respectively. Surprisingly, the total solar electricity actually gained in 6 months (January to June) in 2015 was 4471 kWh, while the total solar electricity actually gained in 6 months (January to June) in 2016 was 5519 kWh. The payback for this BIPV Sadeem Building will be 624 years, while if feed-in- tariff is set to purchase each 1 kWh solar electricity for 380 fils (about USD1) then the payback will be reasonable (about 5 years). This reaches to the conclusion that either the government sells the PV system with a highly subsidized rate or purchases each kWh of solar electricity at not less than USD1. Assuming that each kWh results in emitting about 1 kg of CO2, then this BIPV saves, annually, the emission of about 9 t of CO2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-0321,1879-0690,,,,FEB,2018,82,,1,,,,205,214,,10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.041,,,,,,,WOS:000417079400016,,,,,,

Average solar and visible transmittance of this perovskite BIPV window was 30% and 20% respectively. Solar heat gain for different incident angle was evaluated for this perovskite glazing.

Since the North has an abundance of solar energy, significant energy savings with some added construction cost in houses could be achieved by applying high-performance building envelopes and solar design strategies. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of both passive and active solar design strategies in improving the energy efficiency of northern housing. Firstly, a reference house representing a typical single-family home in the North is modeled using EnergyPlus, and the key passive design parameters are optimized to minimize life-cycle cost. Then, the air-based building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) system is applied to the optimized house and integrated with HVAC systems. It is found that optimal passive solar design can reduce the heating energy demand by 42% with an incremental cost of 8% for Yellowknife and by 27% without incurring an incremental cost for Kuujjuaq. Integrating BIPV/T with HVAC systems can reduce the defrost time of heat recovery ventilator (HRV), extend the working hours and improve the COP of air source heat pump (ASHP). The reduction in the total energy consumption is in the range of 1.4%-3.0% by integrating HRV and 0.3%-0.6% by integrating ASHP due to the mis-match of solar availability and heating energy demand. To maximize the utilization of solar energy available, the optimal use of thermal energy recovered from BIPV/T system in northern housing requires further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-3599,1996-8744,,,,OCT,2021,14,5,,,,,1467,1486,,10.1007/s12273-021-0763-1,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000623703500002,,,,,,

This study aims to identify relevant barriers that still hinder the greater adoption of BIPV perceived by stakeholders in Singapore, as well as the drivers for BIPV that would lead building sector to adopt BIPV technologies. The study involved five important groups of stakeholders i.e. governmental authorities, building developers, architects, engineers, and PV/BIPV manufacturers to participate in a questionnaire survey. The results identified that on-site generation of clean energy bundled with economic benefits, Green Mark certification, and avoidance of CO2 emissions are the most influential drivers, while longterm payback period, high upfront cost, and low energy conversion efficiency are the three most substantial barriers to BIPV. Furthermore, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine whether the various stakeholder groups perceive the drivers and barriers differently. It was discovered that various stakeholder groups perceive the drivers similarly, but the significantly different opinions have been perceived on several barriers.

J,"Huang, MJ",,,,"Huang, Ming Jun",,,The effect of using two PCMs on the thermal regulation performance of BIPV systems,SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPVs) is one of the most promising applications for Photovoltaics (PVs). However, when the temperature in the BIPV increases, the conversion efficiency deteriorates. A PV/PCM system using Phase Change Materials (PCM) for BIPV thermal control has been experimentally and numerically studied previously. One of the main barriers for this application is how to improve the low thermal conductivity of the PCM in order to achieve a quick thermal dissipation response with longer thermal regulation in PVs. Although the metal fins inserted inside the PCM can improve the heat transfer, the thermal regulation period declines as the volume of the PCM is substituted by the metal mass of the PV/PCM system. A modified PV/PCM system integrated with two PCMs with different phase transient temperatures for improving the heat regulation needs to be investigated. The use of combinations of PCMs, each with a set of different phase transient temperatures, is expected to enhance the thermal regulation effect of the PV/PCM system and lengthen the thermal regulation time in PVs. In this study a developed PV/PCM numerical simulation model for single PCM application has been modified to predict the thermal performance of the multi-PCMs in a triangular cell in the PV/PCM system. A series of numerical simulations tests have been carried out in static state and realistic conditions in UK. The thermal regulation of the PV/PCM system with a different range of phase transient temperature PCMs has been discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study used whole-building energy simulation models, a DOE-2.1e BIPV window module created for this study, and an existing daylight-dimming system module. Based on the simulation results, peak demand, energy use, and electricity production from each orientation (east-, west-, south-, and north-facing) were all analyzed. The south-facing window showed the greatest potential to generate electric power and reduce cooling loads/use, whereas the east-facirig window resulted in the largest annual lighting energy savings. As compared to the code-compliant base-case model, the BIPV windows showed great potential for energy savings: about 12-21% in annual energy use, and 14-26% in peak cooling demand. In addition, the parametric study varying the window-to-wall ratio (WWR) with the BIPV window resulted that the larger BIPV window provided more savings in annual total energy use.

In addition, the impact of changes in building operation time, temperature settings, air infiltration from the entrances, and internal load were also analyzed as these all have a large impact on heating and cooling loads. Finally, three types of heating and cooling equipment were tested, and their power and primary energy consumption analyzed, to determine the actual energy used. Under baseline conditions, there was an 18.2% reduction in heating and cooling loads when the BIPV model was used compared to when the clear glass double-layer window was used. In addition, increases in temperature settings and air infiltration from the entrances had a negative effect on the reduction of the heating and cooling loads demonstrating a need for intensive management of these features if a-Si BIPV windows are installed in a building.",,,,,"An, Youngsub/0000-0001-8564-1015; Yoon, Jongho/0000-0001-8813-5310",,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4856,10.3390/su10124856,,,,,,,WOS:000455338100522,,,,,,

This house, with a design goal of near net-zero annual energy consumption, was constructed in 2007 in Eastman, Quebec, Canada - a cold climate area. Several novel solar technologies are integrated into the house and with passive solar design to reach this goal. An air-based open-loop BIPV/T system produces electricity and collects heat simultaneously. Building-integrated thermal mass is utilized both in passive and active forms. Distributed thermal mass in the direct gain area and relatively large south facing triple-glazed windows (about 9% of floor area) are employed to collect and store passive solar gains. An active thermal energy storage system (TES) stores part of the collected thermal energy from the BIPV/T system, thus reducing the energy consumption of the house ground source heat pump heating system. This paper focuses on the BIPV/T system and the integrated energy concept of the house. Monitored data indicate that the BIPV/T system has a typical efficiency of about 20% for thermal energy collection, and the annual space heating energy consumption of the house is about 5% of the national average. A thermal model of the BIPV/T system suitable for preliminary design and control of the airflow is developed and verified with monitored data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, its commercialization has been limited by the low power generation efficiency and durability. Few studies have examined the power generation performance of a full scale DSSC module applied to actual buildings. In this study, a long-term performance test was conducted on vertical and inclined DSSC BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) windows applied to a full-scale mock-up facility to verify the power performance and power characteristics of transparent DSSC BIPV glazing under actual conditions over a 2 year period. The DSSC module was fabricated by the serial connection of nine 2.26Wp transparent DSSC sub-modules. The multi-layered DSSC BIPV glazing, which was composed of a DSSC module (9mm) + air space (12 mm) + clear glass (5mm) was joined to the curtain wall frame of the test cell facility. The unit size of the DSSC BIPV glazing was 0.975 m (W) x 0.965 m (H) and its maximum capacity was 20.34Wp. The size of the test cell facility was 3 m (W) x 3 m (H) x 9 m (D). The building is a container type insulated with 100 mm urethane foam. Four and two DSSC BIPV windows were installed on the vertical south wall and on the 30 degrees sloped roof, respectively. Through the monitoring system, the power performance data of each DSSC BIPV windows and meteorological data were analyzed over a two year period (from 1st Jan. 2015 to 31st Dec 2016). The 2 year data showed that the average daily power yield for each month of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 1.75 to 3.93 kWh/kWp day (average 2.53 kWh/kWp day), whereas that of the 30 degrees sloped DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.16 to 5.34 kWh/kWp day (average 3.60 kWh/kWp day). The operating power efficiency of the vertical DSSC BIPV window ranged from 2.65 to 4.14% with an average of 3.40%, whereas that of the sloped DSSC BIPV window was in the range of 2.64-3.63% with a mean of 3.01%. The power generation efficiency of the vertical plane BIPV window was higher than the sloped BIPV window. In contrast to the average daily power yield, the power efficiency of the vertical window was higher than that of the sloped window, which may be due to the higher efficiency of the DSSCs under overcast conditions. This is consistent with the power performance of the DSSC BIPV windows according to the sky conditions, which showed an increase in power efficiency with increasing cloud cover or decreasing solar intensity.",,,,,"Yoon, Jongho/0000-0001-8813-5310",,,,,,,,,,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,SEP 1,2018,225,,,,,,1013,1021,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.086,,,,,,,WOS:000438181000078,,,,,,

The study first investigated the monthly PR of each inverter to verify what caused the decrease in power performance by analyzing PR variation. Then, the shading analysis was performed using a simulation to analyze the capture loss of measured power performance and ultimately to find out the effect by partial shading components such as small overhang louvers of each floor, obstructions of adjacent building, and nearby hillock. The one-year measurement of the power performance showed that the annual average reference yield was 2.15 h/day and the final yield was 1.52 h/day; moreover, it was analyzed that the annual average capture loss was 0.49 h/day and the system loss was 0.14 h/day. Monthly average reference yield in summer (between April and August) showed only 1.28 h/day which was 54% lower than the other seasons with average 2.77 h/day. The annual average of PR was 0.69 (the monthly maximum of 0.77 and minimum of 0.58); the average PR in the summer with low reference yield was 0.64, while the average PR for other seasons was 0.73. Whereas monthly variation of LS (system loss) did not show big difference of under 9%, monthly LC (capture loss) highly varied with fluctuation. These primarily arise from the effect of the partial shading and vertically installed angle of south-facing BIPV modules. The BIPV system consisted of four arrays and installed on the same south facade. However, the power performance analysis per array showed that each array had different performances. The arrays located above the facade had the highest PR, from 0.74, 0.75, 0.66, and 0.62 respectively in order. In addition, LS and LC analysis of each array showed that there was performance difference mainly by LC, due to the influence of an adjacent building located in the south. The analysis using the simulation showed the adjacent building did not cast any shading but affected on decrease in diffuse solar radiation whose amount was depending on the array location. When it comes to the lowest array, nearly 7% of annual insolation was blocked by front building. The shading analysis, furthermore, revealed that the overhang louvers caused a partial shading problem in spite of short extrusion of 40 mm depth all through the year, and particularly, showed a big effect during summer because of high solar altitude. The extruded louvers caused decrease in 4.5% of average insolation loss over the year. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The typical single-family, detached home roof covers can easily accommodate the proposed PV kits, with 87% of these generators yielding at least 95% of the maximum theoretical generation output of an ideally oriented and tilted PV system. Low-pitched, existing roof covers in residential houses represent excellent areas for PV integration at low latitudes.

Hence the implementations of solar Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in urban China should be carefully assessed from cost-benefit aspects, considering the existence of widely used DSWH systems. This study comprehensively collected the information related to the cost and benefit of DSWH and BIPV systems from literatures and conducted surveys on available roof area of households in Xi'an city with 96 samples. Then 25 year lifetime cost-benefit analyses were performed to demonstrate the comparison between the two solar utilization systems with different roof area. The results indicated that only when the available roof area is more than 6 m(2), BIPV system can utilize more solar energy than DSWH could. One typical set of DSWH requiring 34 m(2) roof area is the optimal setting, and 84% urban China households are capable to install it. BIPV system has an equivalent cost-benefit performance only if the system cost is as low as RMB 0.61kW h, and with the presence of RIVIB 1.00/kW h incentive feed-in tariff. If the system cost of BIPV is RMB 0.9/kW h, available roof area of 14 m(2) is required but only 18% households can afford it. These results are expected to raise a potential decision making issue between DSWH and BIPV, and provide basis of guideline for implementation of projects of both systems in urban area, particularly in China.

For both technologies, the model was validated against three years of data collected from the outdoor test field at Supsi for a conventional ventilated free-rack mounted installation (south facing, 45(circle)-tilt). In the present work, we expand the simulations to model the performance of the same technologies for the same location and to include building integrated (BIPV) installation conditions. For simplicity, we consider two extreme cases: (a) a south-facing facade installation (90(circle)-tilt) and (b) a perfectly horizontal one (0(circle)-tilt). The angle-of-incidence response of the modules is then used to quantify reflection losses, which are very significant in summer and winter for the facade and horizontal installation, respectively. Further, compared to ventilated ones, fully integrated PV modules exhibit average operating temperatures that can reach an offset of +20(circle)C in days of clear sky conditions. This offset is used to model the operating temperatures - and performance losses - of the BIPV modules. The model, whose main limitation is the focus on days of clear sky conditions, allows assessing the distinguished contributions, and peculiar time-phases, of each effect to the yearly energy performance of the devices under test.

One of the main barriers to its larger adoption is its initial capital cost, as BIPV is generally more expensive than traditional roof or fa cade mounted photovoltaic modules(PV). Converting BIPV systems into BIPV with thermal energy recovery (BIPV-T) can improve its benefit and competitiveness compared to other solar energy technologies. This benefit is difficult to estimate, however, as it strongly depends on the usefulness of the thermal energy produced and the incremental cost of the technology to recover the heat. This study aims at evaluating the cost-benefit of BIPV-T focusing on systems that use air as the heat recovery fluid and are integrated into all-electric energy-efficient homes located in heating dominated climates. This cost-benefit is evaluated using the concept of break-even cost defined as the maximum incremental cost to convert a BIPV system into a BIPV-T system to break-even with the cost of (a) a BIPV system and (b) side-by-side PV modules and solar thermal collectors (PV + T). To obtain this cost, the useful equivalent energy production of BIPV, BIPV-T and PV + T systems was first obtained for six energy-efficient housing archetypes located in various cities across Canada. Four different heat management scenarios were considered for the BIPV-T system: (1) fresh air preheating, (2) domestic hot water preheating through an air-to water heat exchanger, (3) domestic hot water and space heating with an air-to-water heat pump and (4) domestic hot water heating (DHW) with a heat pump water heater. Compared to BIPV, BIPV-T systems always produce more useful energy and as a result, the break-even cost compared to a BIPV system was found to be always positive and up to 2700 CAD for a medium 2-storey home located in Montreal. For that same house and considering the price of BIPV equal to that of standard roof-mounted PV modules, the break-even cost of a BIPVT system compared to a PV + T system was estimated at 4200 CAD. If the price of BIPV were to get 10% lower than PV, however, this break-even cost could increase to 6400 CAD.

This paper proposes the cooling system using thermoelectric element so as to solve such problems. The temperature control of thermoelectric element can be controlled independently in the outside environment because that is performed by micro-controller. Also, it can be operated around NOCT through algorithm of the temperature control. Therefore, the outputs of the system are increased and the efficiency is risen.

This article presents a dataset for the solar incident radiation and electricity production of PV systems in the north and south orientations in a dense urban area (in the northern hemisphere). The solar incident radiation and the electricity production of two back-to-back PV panels with a ten-centimetre gap for one year are monitored and logged as primary data sources. Using Microsoft Excel, both panels' efficiency is also presented as a secondary source of data. The implemented PV panels are composed of polycrystalline silicon cells with an efficiency of 16.9%. The results depicted that the actual efficiency of the south-facing panel (13-15%) is always closer to the standard efficiency of the panel compared to the actual efficiency of the north-facing panel (8-12%). Moreover, although the efficiency of the south-facing panel on sunny days of the year is almost constant, the efficiency of the north-facing panel decreases significantly in winter. This phenomenon might be linked to the spectral response of the polycrystalline silicon cells and different incident solar radiation spectrum on the panels. While the monitored data cover the radiation and system electricity production in various air conditions, the analysis is mainly conducted for sunny days, and more investigation is needed to analyse the system performance in other weather conditions (like cloudy and overcast skies).

Government policy plays a significant role in nurturing and protecting energy innovations at the early development stage, such as BIPV. However, various actors could have divergent views on the policies for energy innovations, and policymakers need to consider these views in policymaking to avoid potential failures in policy implementation. By taking BIPV as an example, this study aims to reveal stakeholders' different perspectives on the required innovation policies for new energy technologies based on Q methodology. The results indicate even though stakeholders share similar views on some aspects of BIPV policies, four significantly distinct policy perspectives on BIPV exist in stakeholders' mindsets, including supervisory support, intensively investigate, cautiously stimulate and proactively promote. These policy perspectives require significantly different approaches to promote BIPV, which indicates the complexity in formulating one set of policy mix catering for the various mindsets of stakeholders.

By taking into account that storage is a key factor in the effective use of renewable energy, the present article is an overview about storage systems which are appropriate for BIPV and BIPVT applications. The literature review shows that there are multiple storage solutions, based on different kinds of materials (batteries, Phase Change Material (PCM) components, etc.). In terms of BIPV and BIPVT with batteries or PCMs or water tanks as storage systems, most of the installations are non-concentrating, facade- or roof-integrated, water- or air-based (in the case of BIPVT) and include silicon-based PV cells, lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries, paraffin- or salt-based PCMs. Regarding parameters that affect the environmental profile of storage systems, in the case of batteries critical factors such as material manufacturing, accidental release of electrolytes, inhalation toxicity, flammable elements, degradation and end-of-life management play a pivotal role. Regarding PCMs, there are some materials that are corrosive and present fire-safety issues as well as high toxicity in terms of human health and ecosystems. Concerning water storage tanks, based on certain studies about tanks with volumes of 300 L and 600 L, their impacts range from 5.9 to 11.7 GJ(prim) and from 0.3 to 1.0 to CO2.eq. Finally, it should be noted that additional storage options such as Trombe walls, pebble beds and nanotechnologies are critically discussed. The contribution of the present article to the existing literature is associated with the fact that it presents a critical review about storage devices in the case of BIPV and BIPVT applications, by placing emphasis on the environmental profile of certain storage materials.

The combined efficiency over the span of a full day could reach values up to 80%, but this apparent high value needs to be analysed in detail. From the experimental results, it can be observed that both systems, PV and PV-T, have a good electrical performance. But the PV-T system output does not benefit from the lower module temperatures that it should achieve from the active cooling in its back, presenting the same performance as the simple PV system. Regarding the microinverters configuration performance, it has been very positive working with high efficiencies above 96%, justifying its use in this type of applications. In conclusion, the commercial PV-T system has not performed as expected, showing problems with the integration of the active cooling in the back of the PV modules.

To investigate the thermal performance of the system, the variations of the temperatures, e.g., flat-plate glass cover, PV panel, filling space, heat pipe, and tank water, as well as the ambient temperature, were measured, and the system's thermal efficiency was calculated and studied for different simulated solar radiations and water flow rates. It was found that the temperatures of the flat-plate glass cover, PV panels, filling space, and heat pipe presented the similar variation pattern when the ambient temperature was stable. The tank water temperature could reach the maximum of 53.83 degrees C when the simulated solar radiation was at 900 W/m(2) and the water flow rate was at 200l/h.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a cost-effective approach to automatically detect faults in the energy productions of BIPV systems using historical BIPV energy productions as the only source of information that is typically collected in all BIPV systems. Design/methodology/approach Energy productions of BIPV systems are time series in nature. Therefore, time series methods are used to automatically detect two categories of faults (outliers and structure changes) in the monthly energy productions of BIPV systems. The research methodology consists of the automatic detection of outliers in energy productions, and automatic detection of structure changes in energy productions. Findings The proposed approach is applied to detect faults in the monthly energy productions of 89 BIPV systems. The results confirm that outliers and structure changes can be automatically detected in the monthly energy productions of BIPV systems using time series methods in presence of short-term variations, monthly seasonality, and long-term degradation in performance. Originality/value Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach does not require performance ratio calculation, operating condition data, such as solar irradiation, or the output of neighboring BIPV systems.

The research is divided in two papers: Part 1: Theoretical study and Part 2: Application in case studies. Part 1 consists in identifying and quantifying the shading on a surface, and relates the fraction of shaded area with the percentage of incident irradiation reduction during the same period, in order to propose a shading index (SI) that represents the energy losses due to shadings on PV systems. The method was developed for a theoretical shaded case study simulated in two cities located at low latitude, tropical regions: Singapore (1.35 degrees N) and Florianopolis-Brazil (27.48 degrees S). Results showed that the shading percentage on the analysed surface on an annual basis is closer to the percentage of incident irradiation reduction at same period than when these values are compared on other time bases, as hourly, daily or monthly. Therefore, in this case, the annual percentage of shading can be adopted as the SI. SI was validated using different computer software packages and it was proved to be a convenient way of estimation the PV generation of similar cases of partially shaded PV systems, that could be used even before the PV electrical desing has been done.

We analyze beam irradiances of two horizontal pyranometers situated next to a lake, one facing upwards and one facing downwards, to estimate the contribution of Fresnel reflection to the beam irradiance on a vertical surface. We show that in general the observed beam irradiance on the downward facing instrument matches the calculated Fresnel reflection. In contrast to other studies investigating water albedo, we also found that the reflection percentage decreases consistently with higher wind speeds and lower solar zenith angle. Fresnel reflection has the highest contribution for vertical surfaces in winter, with varying contributions between <1% and >30% of monthly global irradiance over the course of one year for different latitudes, and should thus be included in yield estimates for building integrated PV installations situated next to bodies of water.

Through the overlapping of the energy and construction sector, one of the initiatives that the government has done after research and development is the Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) program. However, though more than ten years have passed after the introduction of BIPV, the implementation is still considered very weak as it is still not a common practice in the construction industry. One of the reasons is because many are still sceptical about BIPV especially among house buyers and are more concern to the prices of the houses. The other factor is developers are dormant in using BIPV and have limited support in BIPV information that can convince house buyers make their decision to invest into BIPV. This research investigates the application issues faced by the developers, their outlook on BIPV and considerations for selection on BIPV. A three stage Delphi interview with eight developer companies as part of a purposive sample is applied, where stage one focuses on the application issues that is faced by developing and stage two the depth of the issues with workable solutions is proposed and validated among the developing consensus. Stage three helps mapping out crucial criteria of selection process that the developers will employ and other consideration towards BIPV. The preliminary results show that more establish developers have employed green technology, but none has considered BIPV yet with cost as a major factor in mind. Their process of selection is not established and individual has various interests that needed to be maintained. It can be concluded that developers indeed are a substantial catalyst for implementing BIPV.

Uniform heat flux condition was developed on the heaters to closely simulate non-uniform temperature distribution on vertical PV modules. The two thermocouples on the probe measured local air temperature and contact temperature with the wall surface.

In addition to effectively generating energy, BIPV need to be energy efficient. They would need to passively regulate the responsiveness of the building envelope to the external environment to provide (natural) indoor thermal comfort, thus accomplishing the prime function of a building. Thermal comfort is an important parameter in building design as it contributes to overall health and productivity. Tropical regions, such as India, are generally characterized by high temperatures and humidity where passive designs need to integrate a combination of both, appropriate thermal massing and space orientation for adequate ventilation. BIPV poses unique considerations (and opportunities) as the inherent thermal mass is low and the radiative transmittance is high. Consequently, the BIPV also permits rapid heat-loss at night from the indoors through radiation, particularly when integrated as a roof. Regulating indoor thermal comfort in tropical regions poses a particular challenge under such conditions, as the Mean Radiant Temperature is likely to be high. Thermal comfort is also a key factor in assessing the energy efficiency of a building envelope as it determines the dependence on active (power-intensive) regulation for providing thermal comfort. Thus, building design strategies for optimizing BIPV performance would require an integrated consideration of three interdependencies, viz., maximizing PV performance, passive climate-responsive environment and natural thermal comfort. The paper investigates the performance of a 5.25 kWp roof integrated BIPV lab at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (India) and is based on a year-long systematic study of parameters determining PV performance, indoor thermal comfort and building climate response. Regulating indoor thermal comfort is of particular concern as temperature stratification has been noted under BIPV roof. The current paper investigates the influence of thermal comfort on building climate response and BIPV performance and suitable strategies have also been evaluated through a simulation model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-88-6046-058-5,,,,2013,,,,,,,181,190,,,,,,,,,WOS:000396444500020,,,,,,

It is thus essential to properly evaluate and compare the PV temperature conditions of different PV module categories (in terms of PV technology and material type). Several explicit correlations exist for the evaluation of the PV module temperature, among which the simplest and most handy is a linear expression (i.e. T-mod = T-amb+k G) which links T-mod with the ambient temperature (T-amb) and the incident solar radiation flux (G). Within this expression the value of the dimensional parameter k, known as the Ross coefficient, depends on several aspects (i.e. module type, wind velocity and integration characteristics). However, dispersed values for this parameter can be found in literature (in the range of 0.02-0.06 K m(2)/W) according to different module types, while more information are provided regarding different integration characteristics. This paper aims at giving an overview of the value of k for different module types according to monitored data registered over one year time period at the ABD-PV plant in Bolzano (Italy). The highest values of k, which means the highest module temperature at a certain G, are registered for the three glass-glass (G-G) module types (k(Tmod, c) from 0.033 K m(2)/W to 0.037 K m(2)/W). The glass-tedlar (G-T) module types operate at slight lower temperature values (k(Tmod, c) ranging from 0.029 K m(2)/W to 0.032 K m(2)/W). (C) 2014 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted by carrying detailed numerical analyses of energy produced by the BIPV facade and its consumption in adjacent office room. Calculations of energy generated by PV panels were made using simulation programme ESP-r. Advanced model, used in analyses, take into account dependence of the main electrical parameters of photovoltaic cell from temperature. Findings - The findings reveal that energy generated by photovoltaic panels during transitional and cooling seasons is sufficient for lighting and ventilation requirement. However during winter months BIPV facade can cover energy demand only for ventilation. Originality/value - The paper provides an original analysis of experimental BIPV facade system as a source of on-site produced renewable energy to cover energy demand in offices building under certain climate conditions. The results reported in presented paper shows the potential of BIPV facades and display this potential in a context of building net energy balance.",,,,"Heim, Dariusz/P-5881-2015","Heim, Dariusz/0000-0002-1036-5818; Knera, Dominika/0000-0002-5053-4647",,,,,,,,,,,,1477-7835,1758-6119,,,,,2016,27,6,,,SI,,649,662,,10.1108/MEQ-05-2015-0104,,,,,,,WOS:000413396700004,,,,,,

To accomplish this objective, three BIPV systems located in Singapore with photovoltaic (PV) systems playing an aesthetically appealing role in their architecture were analysed in detail for a 1-year period. The systems were analysed regarding the available solar irradiation, the shading profiles and the resulting yield and performance ratio (PR) in order to compare the performance of different subsystems with variable architectural characteristics and string configurations. All systems are partially shaded in the early morning or late afternoon, a common situation inherent to BIPV systems. Results show that even with a theoretical non-optimal combination of azimuthal deviations and tilt angles, some PV systems show better performances in terms of yield and PR than those which are installed at more ideal conditions. The high ratio of diffuse irradiation in Singapore, the distance of shading obstacles and times when shading occurs and the subsystem and string configurations strongly influence the systems performance results. With the declining costs of PV systems, BIPV can offer attractive solutions with high integration appeal, architectural sophistication and the promotion of sustainable energy supply. In the tropics, rooftop BIPV systems can perform with relatively small losses and be aesthetically appealing when compared with optimally tilted and oriented PV generators.

The algorithmic approach predicts PV temperature at the centre of the cell, the back and the front glass cover with fast convergence and serves the PV power output prediction. The simulation model is robust, predicting PV temperature with high accuracy at any environmental conditions, PV inclination, orientation, wind speed and direction, and mounting configurations, free-standing and BIPV. These, alongside its theoretical basis, ensure the model's wide applicability and clear advantage over existing PV temperature prediction models. The model is validated for a wide range of environmental conditions, PV geometries and mounting configurations with experimental data from a sun-tracking, a fixed angle PV and a BIPV system. The deviation between predicted and measured power output for the fixed-angle and the sun-tracking PV systems was estimated at -1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. The median of the temperature difference between predicted and measured values was as low as 0.5 degrees C for the sun-tracking system, and for all cases, the predicted temperature profiles were closely matching the measured profiles.

As the building sector accounts for almost 40% of the energy consumption in Europe, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems gain peoples' interest lately concerning the replacement of the conventional construction materials of the buildings envelope with photovoltaic (PV) panels which can serve at the same time as construction material and energy producer. The aim of this study is to present an overview of the available published research on the BIPV systems and identify the barriers and risks associated with the application of BIPV and discuss the future perspectives and solutions through recommendations for future research and development. The most important barriers of the BIPV systems are the feed in tariff implementation, the public acceptance, the governmental economic support in terms of subsidies and technical aspects like the power losses and the architectural considerations. The future perspectives of the BIPV systems proposed are based on the barriers discussed. It is stated that new solutions in the PV industry are many and various and there is room for improvement regarding design, configuration, ventilation, positioning, guidelines, monitoring and performance prediction. In total, more than 100 articles have been identified and analysed since 2000. Many of these articles have a predominant focus on the investigation of the performance of the system, and the ventilation of the PV panels in BIPV applications for electricity production, due to the negative role of the temperature on PVs electrical efficiency, and the heat transfer behavior of the system. This paper shows that although research in the adoption of BIPV systems in terms of their performance and optimization is fairly new, it has gained attention in the last decades. However, their practical applications have been slow in comparison with the conventional rack-mounted PV panels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In cold climate regions, we predict that there will also be a growing focus on how to avoid snow and ice formation on the exterior surfaces of BIPV. During the winter period there is substantially less incident solar radiation. This is also the period when the solar radiation is most needed for heating, lighting and power production purposes. The task to avoid accretion of snow and ice is challenging due to the fact that snow, ice and ambient weather conditions exist in countless variations and combinations. Snowfall, freezing of rain water and condensation of air moisture with subsequent freezing, are examples of aspects that have to be addressed in a satisfactory way.

W.",,,Comparative performance assessment of a non-ventilated and ventilated BIPV rooftop configurations in the Netherlands,SOLAR ENERGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Backside ventilation is one of the most common passive cooling methods of PV modules in the built environment, but might be under constraint when integrating PV in the building envelope. To investigate the short and long term effect of backside ventilation on Building Integrated PV (BIPV) performance and lifespan, a comparative BIPV field test is conducted in a real life lab located in the Netherlands. The field test includes 24 modules in 4 segments with different levels of backside ventilation. PV energy output, module backside temperature, relative humidity in the air gap, and air velocity in the air gap have been monitored for three years in the period January 2013-December 2015. At the end of the monitoring period Electric Luminescence (EL) images were made and Standard Testing Condition (STC) power was determined. The ventilated segments show a similar behaviour (6% difference) in PV energy output, but the non-ventilated segment shows a strong decrease of 86% in output after three years. A maximum temperature of 72 degrees C is reached in the ventilated segments and a maximum temperature of 83 degrees C in the non ventilated segment. Relative humidity (RH) levels reach a maximum of 100% in all segments. Air velocity in the non-ventilated segment is 13-39% of the air velocity in the ventilated segments. STC power determination and EL imaging show lower peak power and more defects in the non-ventilated modules, and modules placed at vertical higher positions in the non-ventilated segment have a lower power output of 50-60%. The results indicate that, considering the first generation Metal Wrap Through (MWT) modules investigated, the non-ventilated BIPV modules exposed to the highest temperatures show the lowest power output, lowest STC power and show the most damaged cells in the EL imaging. Even though PV module manufacturing shows continuous technological advances, the methodology and results of this work has added value for the prediction of BIPV operating aspects and lifespan when designing and realizing a BIPV installation. Moreover, the BIPV field test presented in this study has been a very illustrative BIPV demonstration project for manufacturers, installers and designers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper firstly presents an integrated simulation framework to couple photovoltaic electricity generation to building energy savings through adaptive shading. A high-resolution radiance and photovoltaic model calculates the photovoltaic electricity yield while taking into account partial shading between modules. The remaining solar irradiation that penetrates the window is used in a resistance capacitance building thermal model. A simulation of all possible dynamic configurations is conducted for each hourly time step, of which the most energy efficient configuration is chosen. We then utilise this framework to determine the optimal orientation of the photovoltaic panels to maximise the electricity generation while minimising the building's heating, lighting and cooling demand. An existing adaptive photovoltaic facade was used as a case study for evaluation. Our results report a 20-80% net energy saving compared to an equivalent static photovoltaic shading system depending on the efficiency of the heating and cooling system. In some cases the Adaptive Solar Facade can almost compensate for the entire energy demand of the office space behind it. The control of photovoltaic production on the facade, simultaneously with the building energy demand, opens up new methods of building management as the facade can control both the production and consumption of electricity.

An experimental mockup composed of a three-layer ETFE cushion and amorphous silicon photovoltaic panels (a-Si PV) has been developed and a series of experiments have been conducted in summer, especially under sunny and sunny to cloudy conditions. On the whole, the experimental results showed that this system operated smoothly and steadily. In this paper, two studies, i.e. one-day study and three-day study have been done to investigate system performance and feasibility. For energy, the average stored electricity was 61 W h and the average ratio of consumption electricity to output electricity under sunny condition was lower than that under sunny to cloudy condition. Meanwhile, an average temperature difference between air temperatures inside and outside of the cushion was 18.1 C. Therefore, system electricity feasibility and potential in solar energy utilization have been verified. For cushion structures, temperatures on structural ETFE membranes used to resist external loads were within the acceptable range and pressure performance was satisfactory. Therefore, structure feasibility has been demonstrated. This study reveals the technical feasibility of ETFE cushion structure integrated photovoltaic.

The methodology employs a correlation between thermal and electrical output of the BIPV/T system, and analysis of the effect of combinations of tilt and orientation angles of the BIPV/T system. Optimal configurations are implemented in the roof of a rectangular housing unit. Gable roof with 45 tilt angle is used as reference.

Some roof shape designs enable increasing the potential of BIPV/T systems by up to 30%, as compared to the reference roof. The effect of roof design on heating and cooling loads is not highly significant (<5%). While redesigning unit shapes does not significantly affect their energy performance, it can provide some design flexibility.

In this study, two prediction models used most commonly, the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT) model and the Sandia National Laboratory temperature prediction model (SNL), were investigated for their suitability in the prediction of PV module's temperatures for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) installation in the tropical climate conditions of Thailand. It was found that, in general, the SNL model tends to give better results of temperature prediction than those of the NOCT model. Nevertheless, both models are strongly over-biased in temperature predictions. The discrepancies of the predictions are basically caused by the dissimilarity of the BIPV installation and the standard installation as specified by the models, rather than the effect of differences in climatic conditions between the temperate and tropical zones. In the worst case, it was found that the highest value of the mean bias error (MBE) is +8 degrees C, or equivalent to +21% of the mean observed temperature, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is +/- 10 degrees C, or equivalent to +/- 24% of the mean observed temperature. However, although these errors were large, their effects on the accuracy of the final prediction of the electrical power output generated by the PV module over a long term would not be great. The error of the expected generated energy output would not be more than 6% of the averaged actual energy output, which is acceptable for most applications.

However, compared to standard double glazing, an clement incorporating either mono or poly crystalline PV cells in a glass-glass construction comes at a cost premium. To justify such an application there must be significant added value in the PV solution.

The temperatures of the glass cover, PV panel, micro-channel flat-plate heat pipes, and tank water were measured, as well as the ambient temperature. The thermal and electrical efficiency was also calculated for the system operated under the conditions with different simulated radiations and water flow rates.

Photovoltaic (PV) systems are promising solar energy applications to generate electricity without emitting pollutants and requiring no fuel. In modern urban cities, most buildings are high-rise with limited spaces for PV system installation, the concept of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) would be an appropriate alternative form of the application. This paper studies a medium size grid-connected BIPV system mounted in an institutional building. Technical data including solar radiation and energy output were analyzed. The operational performance and electricity benefits of the BIPV system were examined in terms of cost, energy and environmental aspects. The monetary, embodied energy and greenhouse gas payback periods were estimated and reported. To shorten the payback periods, the BIPV system should incorporate with more passive energy-efficient architecture designs.

Part 1: State-of-the-art, theory and potential",SOLAR ENERGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Building Integrated Photovoltaic Thermal (BIPV/T) systems are promising solutions for serving local electricity and heat demands in Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). Despite BIPV/T offering clear energetic and space saving advantages compared to separate BIPV and solar thermal, overheating occurs when no thermal demand exists, resulting in reduced yields, stagnation damage, and excessive fluid pressures. Whilst continuous fluid flows mitigate overheating, corresponding parasitic demands and space requirements are significant (pumps, large storage tanks or heat rejection equipment). This two-part study examines an alternative approach to BIPV/T, addressing overheating by combining BIPV and Integrated Collector-Storage Solar Water Heater (ICSSWH) concepts. Solar heating capabilities of ICSSWH collectors are well established and their overnight heat loss characteristics provide passive overheating control. BIPV-ICSSWH approaches have yet to be investigated extensively. This paper (Part 1 of 2) reviews state-of-the-art and performance benchmarks in BIPV/T and ICSSWH; proposes new performance metrics enabling fairer comparisons; and develops a heat transfer model for BIPVICSSWH facade elements employing Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diodes (PLVTD) to regulate absorber temperatures and heat losses. Multi-day solar thermal collection, photovoltaic generation, and overnight heat retention behaviours are simulated in different climates. The modelling results (experimentally validated in Part 2 of 2) suggests BIPV-PLVTD-ICSSWHs with single transparent covers and zeta approximate to 90% PLVTD diodicity achieve eta(T,col) approximate to 60% solar thermal efficiency at N approximate to 0.035m(2)K.W-1, PV/T performance ratio PRT3 approximate to 75%, and heat loss coefficient U(r,sys)A(sys)/u approximate to 20 W.m(-3) K-1.

Following this trend, solar power would become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050. Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, in which conventional materials can be replaced with PV panels that become an integral part of the building, can be enhanced with concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems. In order to increase the cost efficiency of a BIPV system, an optical concentrator can be used to replace expensive PV material with a lower cost option, whilst increasing the electrical output through the concentration of solar power. A concentrator called rotationally asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (RACPC) was analysed in this work under diffuse light conditions. Software simulations and experimental work were carried out to determine the optical concentration gain of the concentrator. Results from this work show that, under diffuse light, the RACPC has an optical concentration gain of 2.12.

Despite huge development in prediction of solar radiation data, there is a gap in extraction of pertinent information from such data. Hence the available data cannot be effectively utilized for engineering application. This is acting as a barrier for the emerging technology. For making accurate engineering and financial calculations regarding any solar energy project, it is crucial to identify and optimize the most significant statistic(s) representing insolation availability by the Photovoltaic setup at the installation site. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) technique has been applied for identifying the statistic(s), which are of high significance from a project designer's point of view. A MATLAB (TM) program has been used to build the annual frequency distribution of hourly insolation over any module plane at a given location. Descriptive statistical analysis of such distributions is done through MINITAB (TM). For Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) installation, similar statistical analysis has been carried out for the composite frequency distribution, which is formed by weighted summation of insolation distributions for different module planes used in the installation. Vital most influential statistic(s) of the composite distribution have been optimized through Artificial Neural Network computation.

Yogyakarta city doesn't have the potential for fossil energy resources, therefore Yogyakarta city was very appropriate to use as an object of renewable energy projections. In the projection of BAPV and BIPV systems as projection scenarios, a platform that used was an application to make a long-term projection, that is LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternative Planning).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1827-1,,,,2019,2097,,,,,,,,30090,10.1063/1.5098265,,,,,,,WOS:000472941400094,,,,,,

Houses with south, southeast and south-west facing roofs are considered eligible for the retrofit since solar irradiation is maximum on south facing surfaces in the northern hemisphere. The PV system is used to produce electricity and supply the electrical demand of the house, with the excess electricity sold to the grid in a net-metering arrangement. The BIPV/T system produces electricity as well as thermal energy to supply the electrical as well as the thermal demands for space and domestic hot water heating. The PV system consists of PV panels installed on the available roof surface while the BIPV/T system adds a heat pump, thermal storage tank, auxiliary heater, domestic hot water heating equipment and hydronic heat delivery system, and replaces the existing heating system in eligible houses. The study predicts the energy savings, GHG emission reductions and tolerable capital costs for regions across Canada. Results indicate that the PV system retrofit yields 3% energy savings and 5% GHG emission reduction, while the BIPV/T system yields 18% energy savings and 17% GHG emission reduction in the Canadian housing stock. While the annual electricity use slightly increases, the fossil fuel use of the eligible houses substantially decreases due to BIPV/T system retrofit. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Functioning both as envelope material and on-site electricity generator, BIPV can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Motivated by the current barriers and misconceptions that withhold a widespread integration of BIPV, particularly regarding financial implications and solar exposure levels that are believed to be unfavourable, this paper aims at bringing new knowledge and a rigorous and adaptable method to inform decision-making and promote the use of BIPV in urban renewal processes. Focusing on the architectural design, we here present a methodology to select active (BIPV) surfaces during the retrofitting process based on a trade-off between the self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS) of a building. The approach consists in iteratively identifying surfaces that achieve a varying annual irradiation value (threshold). It also includes the evaluation of the effect of electricity storage systems. The methodology and the results of its application are presented through the comparison of two case studies in Neuchatel (Switzerland). The outcomes of this new approach for addressing building renovation projects in the urban context can help architects, designers and engineers to better size the installation and the repartition of active surfaces in the renovated thermal envelope. Results show that it is important to take into account a larger range of irradiation levels to choose the active surfaces, especially in high-rise buildings with a greater proportion of facade than roof. In such cases, the irradiation threshold can vary between 600 and 800 kWh/m(2).year depending on the strategy adopted in terms of Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) system improvement or storage system implementation. Such findings demonstrate the need for context-specific methods towards a proper evaluation and better valorisation of BIPV potential. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This type of prediction is often based on accelerated ageing and tests in indoor condition. However, the combination of different phenomena, such as the mean solar radiation available on the site, the presence of dust, the shadowing or UV radiation over long-outdoor exposure, affect in different ways the real performance of the PV systems. This paper presents a detailed assessment of the testing campaign on the pilot PV plant at the Politecnico di Milano, which underwent 13 years of continuous operation; such period is particularly representative because it can be considered as about half of the supposed lifetime cycle of a photovoltaic system which is usually taken into account for technical-economic evaluations. The results obtained show that the PV plant analyzed didn't present a significant decrease in long-term performance: the measured PR decay is equal to 0.37%/year. In addition, the visual inspection and IR analysis showed that no PV modules are affected by serious damage. This result is due to a good system design during the preliminary stage, high-quality components and also the back ventilation of the modules, which avoids overheating in the warmer periods of the year. Finally, an economic analysis was carried out - based on real historical data - which makes the economic evaluation more reliable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A simplified physical model of the system is proposed for the summer operating configuration, which is more challenging from a numerical perspective. The model describes the active envelop in terms of a simplified geometry, and includes parameters such as density of PV cells, relative coverage of degree of transparency/opaque surfaces, and the ratio of height/width of the double-skin.

Despite BIPV/T offering clear energetic and space saving advantages compared to separate PV and solar thermal, overheating problems occur when no thermal demand exists, resulting in reduced yields, stagnation damage, and excessive fluid flow pressures. This two-part study examines an alternative approach combining BIPV, Planar Liquid-Vapour Thermal Diodes (PLVTD) and Integrated Collector-Storage Solar Water Heaters (ICSSWH) to achieve BIPV/T functionality and retain heat overnight to minimises parasitic demands and reduce overheating.

This paper (Part 2 of 2) describes prototype realisation and multi-day solar simulator laboratory thermal and photovoltaic testing for covered and uncovered variants exposed to different irradiance levels.

Photovoltaic performance reduced with increasing absorber temperature as expected, although maximum power point efficiencies (eta(E,mpp) = 11.4% at T-1 approximate to 25 degrees C and 5.6% at T-1 approximate to 89 degrees C, without cover) were lower than expected owing to partial delamination and PV cell damage.

The authors' concept of using building integrated photovoltaic installation (BIPV) was presented and tested. This study checked whether the presence of PV modules would also affect heat transfer through the external wall of the building on which the installation is located. The analysis consisted of determining, for two variants, the heat transfer coefficients across the partition, in order to estimate the potential thermal energy savings. The first variant concerned the existing state, i.e., heat transfer through the external wall of the building, while the second included an additional partition layer in the form of photovoltaic panels. As a result, the use of panels as wall cladding allowed the improvement of the thermal parameters of the building wall (by increasing the thermal resistance of the wall), and the reduction of gas consumption for heating. The panels also generate electricity for the factory's own needs. Payback time, compared to calculations which do not include changes in thermal parameters, was shortened from 14 to 11 years. The main reason for this is that gas consumption is reduced due to the improved heat transfer coefficient of the wall and the reduction of the heat loss of the facility. This aspect is usually overlooked when considering photovoltaic installations and, as argued by this paper, can be important.",,,,"Kurz, Dariusz/J-4257-2014; Dobrzycki, Arkadiusz/L-7217-2014","Kurz, Dariusz/0000-0002-6737-0052; Mikulski, Stanislaw/0000-0003-1925-6519; Dobrzycki, Arkadiusz/0000-0001-5640-685X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,MAY,2020,13,10,,,,,,,2549,10.3390/en13102549,,,,,,,WOS:000539257300141,,,,,,

Functioning both as envelope material and electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions while providing savings in materials and electricity costs. These are precisely the objectives of most European energy directives, from zero-to positive-energy buildings. In Switzerland for instance, one way to achieve the objectives of the Energy strategy 2050 is to install PV systems to cover 1/3 of the annual electricity demand. However, despite continuous technological and economic progress, the significant assets of BIPV remain broadly undervalued in the current practice. Various obstacles (technology choice, small volumes, lack of information and good examples, etc.) tend to increase the costs and reduce the acceptance of BIPV solutions. The present paper is an integral part of an interdisciplinary research project. Focusing on the architectural design issues, it presents the first results of a representative case study carried out in the city of Neuchatel (Switzerland). The approach involves four main phases (Fig. 1): (i) archetypes identification, (ii) building detailed analysis, (iii) development of architectural renewal design scenarios, and (iv) multi-criteria assessment of each scenario (energy consumption, electricity production, cost-effectiveness, and Life-Cycle Analysis).

BIPV systems offer considerable advantages as compared to stand-alone PV installations. For example, BIPV systems can play a role as essential components of the building envelope. BIPV systems operate as distributed power generators using the most widely available renewable source. Since BIPV systems do not require additional space, they are especially appropriate for urban environments. BIPV/Thermal (BIPV/T) systems may use exterior air to extract useful heat from the PV panels, cooling them and thereby improving their electric performance. The recovered thermal energy can then be used for space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) heating, supporting the utilization of BIVP/T as an appropriate technology for cold climates. BIPV and BIPV/T systems are the subject of several ongoing research and demonstration projects (in both residential and commercial buildings) led by Concordia University. The concept of integrated building design and operation is at the centre of these efforts: BIPV and BIPV/T systems must be treated as part of a comprehensive strategy taking into account energy conservation measures, passive solar design, efficient lighting and HVAC systems, and integration of other renewable energy systems (solar thermal, heat pumps, etc.).

Hence, it is important to focus on the building envelope properties of a BIPV system in addition to energy generation performance when conducting experimental investigations of BIPVs. The aim of this work was to illustrate challenges linked to the building envelope properties of a BIPV system, and to develop and evaluate relevant methods for testing the building envelope properties of BIPV systems. A sample roof area with two BIPV modules was built and tested in a turnable box for rain and wind tightness testing of sloping building surfaces with the aim of investigating the rain tightness of the BIPV system, and observing how it withstood wind-driven rain at large-scale conditions. The BIPV sample roof went through testing with run-off water and wind-driven rain with incremental pulsating positive differential pressure over the sample at two different inclinations. The BIPV sample roof was during testing constantly visually monitored, and various leakage points were detected. In order to prevent such water penetration, the steel fittings surrounding the BIPV modules should ideally be better adapted to the BIPV modules and constricted to some extent. It is however important to maintain a sufficient ventilation rate simultaneously. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The adoption of new technologies, such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), but also new and innovative business models such as community solar, have both been identified as relevant drivers. However, the adoption of BIPV is still encountering numerous barriers that hinder its more widespread deployment within the solar PV market. The goal of this research effort was to assess whether community solar as a successful business model for the adoption of conventional solar PV could be equally promising in relation to the further adoption of BIPV. For this purpose, we conducted an experimental survey (n = 413) to compare customers' willingness to buy a community solar offer exclusively associated with BIPV to a community solar offer solely designed with conventional rooftop solar PV. Our results revealed no significant difference between willingness to buy based on our experimental treatment (BIPV vs. conventional PV), indicating that community solar can be a successful distribution channel for the further adoption of BIPV. As findings about specific business models for BIPV are rare, our research creates an important foundation upon which policy makers and project developers can build. (C)2019 Elsevier B.V.

BIPV products development has been ongoing for the past 30 years, but their practical applications have been slow in comparison to conventional rack-mounted solar PV. One of the main reasons is that the technical barriers, which span from design phase through to commissioning and maintenance phases, have not been understood by stakeholders. The aim of this research is to identify the technical barriers and risks associated with the application of BIPV from building design through to operation stages, together with proposing possible solutions. Where a solution could not be proposed, recommendations for future research and development are made. A four-step research approach is employed, which includes examination of previous publications and collection of feedback from the industry professionals. The research highlighted the importance to apply advanced simulation tools and energy performance monitoring platforms in practice, and encourage stakeholder collaborations in the whole supply chain. This paper contributes to the BIPV area by providing structured knowledge from systematic and longitudinal perspective in relation to the technical barriers and risks, to help professionals understand and improve their knowledge.

Only carcinogens, ecotoxicity and minerals had a small net lifetime burden. A financial analysis was undertaken from the householder's perspective, alongside cost-benefit analysis from a societal perspective. The results of both indicated that the systems are unlikely to pay back their investment over the 25 year lifetime.

This paper presents the results of numerical simulation for the performance prediction of building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal double-skin facade (BIPV/T-DSF). Different BIPV materials (amorphous silicon PV, dye-sensitized solar cell and Perovskite based solar cells) were considered as the exterior cladding of a North-facing facade of an office building located in Australia. The performance assessment involved the selection of three climates in Australia, represented by the cities of Darwin, Sydney and Canberra. The air cavity created between the outer skin and the inner one were alternatively assessed in the non-ventilated, naturally-ventilated and mechanically-ventilated modes of operation, while a full sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the influence of different design parameters, such as internal skin's thermal transmittance, cavity depth, ventilation louvres' opening ratio and cavity ventilation rate. By comparing the different operational modes and BIPV technologies, it was found that naturally-ventilated DSF integrating the Perovskite-based solar cell could be the optimal configuration achieving the highest savings. Total annual energy savings of 34.1%, 86% and 106% annual were reached respectively in Darwin, Sydney and Canberra, in comparison to conventional technologies. In addition, this facade technology could further reduce the building's heating and cooling loads by harvesting thermal energy generated within the air cavity.

The investigation regards a real multistorey apartment block, representative of a significant amount of edifices built in Italy in 1950-1990, which often need refurbishment because of obsolescence. This building type is generally well suited to receive a new double-skin facade, supporting both PV and other common cladding materials, while also representing a good compromise in terms of aesthetic quality, cost, weight, durability and ease of maintenance. In order to make general conclusions, a parametric analysis is performed, by virtually changing the orientation, the number of floors and the climatic conditions, and by considering different PV technologies. The results show that for an 8-storey building with the main axis along E-W, the initial investment can be repaid within around nine years, if considering the current fiscal incentives and a 50% self-consumption rate for the electricity produced by the PV modules. The presence of fiscal incentives is essential to make the investment attractive. Better PV efficiencies, lower prices and higher self-consumption rates can enhance the economic profitability, which may generate a significant impact on the retrofit of European multi-storey residential stock. These results can be effectively extended to the PV integration on the facades of new apartment blocks too. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Air was circulated behind the photovoltaic arrays to recover the thermal energy. TRNSYS was used to evaluate the performance of the TS VC ASHP coupled with the BIPV/T. The thermal performance of the TS VC ASHP was evaluated for two scenarios when the TS VC ASHP was running in heating mode. The two scenarios are: (A) directly feeding ambient air to the TS VC ASHP, and (B) coupling the TS VC ASHP to a wall integrated BIPV/T. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the TS VC ASHP was evaluated and compared for these two separate scenarios. Results suggest that the COP of the TS VC ASHP can be improved for the months of February through April by coupling the TS VC ASHP to a wall integrated BIPV/T system. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The BIPV facade is designed to provide energy generation along with conventional design objectives such as aesthetics and environmental control. The challenge however, is that architectural design objectives sometimes conflict with energy performance, such as the provision of view and daylight versus maximum power output. In innovative cases, the characteristics of conventional BIPV facades have been modified by researchers to address such conflicts through customization as an emerging trend in BIPV facade design. Although extensive reviews exist on BIPV product types, design integration, adoption barriers and performance issues, research on BIPV customization has not been reviewed as a solution to BIPV adoption. This paper seeks to review the potential of BIPV facade customization as a means of enhancing BIPV adoption. The current paper identifies customization parameters ranging from the customization category, level, and strategies, and related architectural potential along with an assessment of their impact. The findings reflect that elemental and compositional level customization using combined customization strategies provide enhanced BIPV products. These products are well integrated for both energy generation and aesthetic applications with a power output increase of up to 80% in some cases.

The VCS concept is based on an integrated thermal structural design with active storage of solar thermal energy while serving as a structural component - the basement floor slab (similar to 33 m(2)). This paper describes the numerical modeling, design, and thermal performance assessment of the VCS. The thermal performance of the VCS during the commissioning of the unoccupied house is presented. Analysis of the monitored data shows that the VCS can store 9-12 kWh of heat from the total thermal energy collected by the BIPV/T system, on a typical clear sunny day with an outdoor temperature of about 0 degrees C. It can also accumulate thermal energy during a series of clear sunny days without overheating the slab surface or the living space. This research shows that coupling the VCS with the BIPV/T system is a viable method to enhance the utilization of collected solar thermal energy.

In this context, the BIPVs integration with the building envelope limits the costs by serving dual purposes. BIPVs have a great advantage compared to non-integrated systems because there is neither need for allocation of land nor stand-alone PV systems. This study seeks to outline various commercially available approaches to BIPVs and thus provides a state-of-the-art review. In addition, possible future research opportunities are explored. The various categories of BIPVs may be divided into photovoltaic foils, photovoltaic tiles, photovoltaic modules and solar cell glazings. Silicon materials are the most commonly used, and a distinction is made between wafer-based technologies and thin-film technologies. In addition, various non-silicon materials are available. The main options for building integration of PV cells are on sloped roofs, flat roofs and facades. The evaluation of the different BIPV products involves, among others, properties such as solar cell efficiency, open circuit voltage, short circuit current, maximum effect and fill factor. It is expected that the BIPV systems will improve in the years to come, regarding both device and manufacturing efficiency. The future seems very promising in the BIPV industry, both concerning new technologies, different solutions and the variety of BIPV options. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

BIPV has significant influence on the heat transfer through the building envelope because of the change of the thermal resistance by adding or replacing the building elements. Four different roofs are used to assess the impacts of BIPV on the building's heating-and-cooling loads; namely ventilated air-gap BIPV, non-ventilated (closed) air-gap BIPV, closeroof mounted BIPV, and the conventional roof with no PV and no air gap. One-dimensional transient models of four cases are derived to evaluate the PV performances and building cooling-and-heating loads across the different roofs in order to select the appropriate PV building integration method in Tianjin, China. The simulation results show that the PV roof with ventilated air-gap is suitable for the application in summer because this integration leads to the low cooling load and high PV conversion efficiency. The PV roof with ventilation air-gap has a high time lag and small decrement factor in comparison with other three roofs and has the same heat gain as the cool roof of absorptance 0.4. In winter, BIPV of non-ventilated air gap is more appropriate due to the combination of the low heating-load through the PV roof and high PV electrical output. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Techno-economic performance of BIPV system with appropriate energy storage has been evaluated for grid power supply limits with appropriate energy tariff for minimizing the annualized energy cost. It has been assumed that the capital costs associated with PV has been included in the building mortgage and expected that in the near future, the grid power supply limits would be introduced and therefore the BIPV house owner may need to install the battery with additional investments and it may affect the techno-economic performance of the BIPV energy system. It has been observed that during month-wise appropriate grid power supply limits, battery with BIPV system can perform much better through energy throughput compare to other reported scenarios. The correlation analysis has been presented for techno-economic performance indicators and observed that there is a strong correlation among PV energy production and grid energy supply.

Given the flexibility of the technology, the use of ray-trace modelling is indispensable in the design, performance evaluation, and optimisation of LSCs. This work begins by comparing a three dimensional (3D) ray-trace model of an LSC with experimental results. The study includes 70 samples - both square and circular LSCs, containing five different fluorescent organic dyes (BASF Lumogen) each at seven different concentrations. The figure-of-merit used for performance evaluation was the average power density determined at the LSC edge sheet, measured using an optical fibre connected to a spectrometer. The results demonstrate that 3D ray-trace results gives good agreement with the experimental measurements, to within around +/- 5% within a wide concentration range (optical density = 0.05-8) and a maximum difference of +/- 13%. The wide range of colours achieved is presented in a CIE chart. Overall, the validated experimental results give confidence in the use of modelling for future larger LSCs for BIPV. Therefore, based on these results and the colours achievable, a model of a stained-glass window is constructed and its performance throughout a solar day is simulated.

A typical rural building having a roof area of 60 sq. m is considered for the study. It was observed that the considered roof area could accommodate, nearly 7kW BIPV system, and on the other side, most buildings seen in Malaysia are of the roof based constructed at different roof pitches. Considering this, a SSPR-BIPV is proposed and analyzed in seven different pitched roofs (the steepness of roof slopes are 15 degrees, 18 degrees, 22 degrees, 30 degrees, 35 degrees, 40 degrees, and 45 degrees) under the tropical weather conditions in Malaysia.Results and discussionAs per the study constraints, the 7kW CdTe BIPV under seven different pitched roofs is capable of generating electricity within the range of 9510 to 7710kWh. Performance ratio and energy losses for seven pitched roofs were identified to be in the range of 74.92 to 76.37% and -23.63 to -25.08% respectively. From the results, it is observed that in a BIPV system, as the building roof pitch increases, the energy yields and performance ratios tend to decrease, thereby increasing the overall energy losses.ConclusionHence, this study reveals that there exists a considerable influence of pitched roof over the BIPV performance and suggests using lower roof pitch angles during the installation of BIPV roof especially in the case tropical weather conditions.",,,,"Manoj Kumar, Nallapaneni/R-8605-2018","Manoj Kumar, Nallapaneni/0000-0002-7382-7784",,,,,,,,,,,,,2314-8543,,,,AUG 14,2019,8,1,,,,,,,2,10.1186/s43088-019-0003-2,,,,,,,WOS:000648608100002,,,,,,

This study examines whether the integration of the photovoltaic (PV) into individual residential buildings in the GCC countries is worth the investment. A prototype residential building is developed and a building integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) system is then designed. The system performance is simulated, and through economic analysis, it is shown that the current BiPV technology is not a cost-effective option for the GCC countries based on the present electricity tariff, PV system cost and system efficiency. The only way such a system would be viable with current technology is if the electricity tariff were to increase substantially. However, if the tariff remains constant for the foreseeable future. BiPV solar energy technology will only be feasible if the total system cost drops drastically. This study shows that BiPV systems offer cost reductions in both energy and economic terms over centralised PV plants, especially if the costs of avoided building construction materials are taken into account. To bring about the benefits of BiPV technology for the GCC residential sector, therefore, the first logical and most practical step is the implementation of a continuous promotion strategy that consists of both subsidies for investments and reasonable tariffs.

However, transforming building surfaces into active electricity generators must consider the thermal behaviour of photovoltaic (PV) panels since it affects both the power conversion efficiency of the PV modules and the thermal comfort of the building. Although several methods have been developed for the evaluation of the thermal performance of the PV modules, at present, no clear consensus exist on which model fits better for this application considering different PV technologies and real operating conditions. This work presents the study of the thermal behaviour of four different PV technologies (polycrystalline silicon, cadmium telluride, amorphous silicon; and organic PV) based on measurements collected by an experimental system located in Murcia (southeast of Spain) during a full year. Two prediction models to estimate the operating cell temperatures of PV modules (NOCT and Sandia) have been evaluated for their suitability in BIPV systems. The results show how both models strongly depend on the incident solar irradiance magnitude and orientation. Furthermore, the correlation between ambient and module temperature difference and the in-plane irradiance shows a thermal hysteresis effect that is mostly independent of the technology but strongly dependent on orientation, with special impact for east and west faces. The results should be taken into consideration for more accurate estimations of electricity production of BIPV systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

While solar represents the most ubiquitous energy source, its appropriate harnessing mechanism requires a careful approach and design. Amid the various direct and indirect electricity generation techniques available, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) carries immense potential to harness solar energy integrated as a component of the building envelope. It is an onsite-distributed power source, offering advantages of size and scale variability, modularity and building integrability. To be energy efficient as a building envelope, BIPV would need to passively regulate the responsiveness of the building envelope to the external environment to accomplish the prime function of a building, i.e. to provide (natural) indoor thermal-comfort for conducive and productive living. However, the requirements for climate-responsive building design may infringe upon those required for optimal PV performance. Besides technological considerations attributed to varying PV (material-dependent) performance efficiencies and high initial investment, a pragmatic approach should also integrate social, environmental and economic factors for successful adoption of a BIPV. It would, thus, require addressing the design requirements for energy-efficient building performance, effective PV integration and societal feasibility. This article attempts to provide an integrability framework encompassing the climate responsiveness factors influencing BIPV performance, which can support further research in this arena.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1748-1317,1748-1325,,,,DEC,2013,8,4,,,,,271,281,,10.1093/ijlct/cts039,,,,,,,WOS:000215335200007,,,,,,

Shadows from nearby objects are mapped onto the modeled BIPV arrays and simulated on an annual, hourly basis, with varying array configuration as well as object size and placement. Results of these simulations show that the impact of MICs on system power output varies depending on factors such as radiation availability, time shaded throughout the year, shadow size and distribution on the array, and inverter design.

The differences in the performance loss rates (PLRs) between module types and mounting configurations were determined by using the year-over-year methodology. The glass/backsheet module was markedly affected by the higher operating temperature: PLR changed from 0.01%/yr for ventilated to -0.42%/yr for insulated. However, the glass/glass module showed an opposite and unexpected trend: PLR changed from -0.10%/yr for ventilated to 0.26%/yr for insulated. Analysis of the IV curve parameters revealed that the decreased performance of the insulated glass/backsheet module was chiefly due to the loss in the fill factor with increased resistance; however, the gain in the short-circuit current (I-sc) was the main driver for the increased performance of the insulated glass/glass module. Real-world temperature coefficients were further examined and they were mostly found to be in line with the values measured indoors. Lower power-temperature and higher current-temperature dependence of the insulated glass/glass module, compared to the ventilated construction, supported the observed performance and current behavior of this module.",,,,"Gok, Abdulkerim/Y-8830-2019","Gok, Abdulkerim/0000-0003-3433-7106",,,,,,,,,,,,2156-3381,2156-3403,,,,SEPT,2020,10,5,,,,,1371,1378,,10.1109/JPHOTOV.2020.3001181,,,,,,,WOS:000562057700023,,,,,,

The thermal and power performance of the vacuum PV glazing were investigated by experiments and numerical simulations. A prototype of the vacuum BIPV curtain wall was set up for a short-term outdoor testing to consolidate its thermal and power performance under typical weather conditions of Hong Kong. A comprehensive energy model was then developed to predict the dynamic power and thermal performance of the vacuum BIPV curtain wall to evaluate its annual energy saving potential compared to other advanced window technologies used in buildings in Hong Kong.

Frequently, the PV collectors are installed on the top of the building. One cost effective method to regulate the temperature of rooftop integrated photovoltaic panels is to provide an open air channel beneath the panel. The cell temperature of these PV modules is very much influenced by the capability of ventilating this channel. The ventilation may be modified by different factors such as the wind velocity, the air gap size, and the forced convection induced by a fan or by a conventional air conditioning system. This paper describes an experimental setup to study the influence of the air gap size and the forced ventilation on the cell temperature (and consequently on the electrical efficiency of the PV module) of a BIPV configuration, for different values of the incident solar radiation, ambient temperatures, and aspect ratios, as well as for several forced ventilation conditions. Semi empirical correlations for the Ross coefficient, module temperature, electrical efficiency, and power output are proposed, showing a good agreement with respect to experimental measurements. A critical channel aspect ratio close to 0.11 can be considered to minimize overheating of PV devices. For a duct velocity V-v = 6 m/s, a power output increase of 19% is observed over the natural ventilation case (V-v = 0.5 m/s). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effect of PV integration on environmental impact is not fully understood. In this study a single indicator for environmental impact assessment of BIPV is investigated in the Netherlands. A BIPV rooftop with 24 multi-crystalline 60-cell modules has been designed with and without backside ventilation, and the environmental impact of these configurations has been assessed in the current situation and three future scenarios. The results are expressed in terms of electricity output difference (AEout), Energy PayBack Time (EPBT), and the single indicator Land Claim (LC); the calculated claim in land-time on the carrying capacity to realize the BIPV rooftop. The EPBT calculations are based on two different datasets, SimaPro and the Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE), and the LC calculations are based on two different models, SimaPro and MAXergy. Calculations indicate that the ventilated BIPV rooftop design generates 2.6% more electricity than the non-ventilated BIPV rooftop design on a yearly basis. Calculations indicate that the EPBT of the ventilated BIPV rooftop design (3.56 and 4.59 years, based on SimaPro and ICE, respectively) is 9 and 6% longer than the EPBT of the non-ventilated BIPV rooftop design (3.25 and 4.32 years, based on SimaPro and ICE, respectively). Calculations indicate that the LC of a m(2) ventilated BIPV rooftop design (24.4 and 19.4 m(2) a, based on SimaPro and MAXergy, respectively) is 18 and 10% higher than the LC of a m(2) non-ventilated BIPV rooftop design (20.0 and 17.4 m(2) a, based on SimaPro and MAXergy, respectively). In the optimal future scenario EPBT might decrease to 2.06 years and LC might decrease to 10.6 m(2) a. This study indicates that the non-ventilated BIPV design shows a lower environmental impact in spite of a lower electric performance and that environmental impact can significantly be reduced in future scenarios.

Next, simplifications are introduced into the model. The model predictions are compared to experimental data from a BIPV curtain wall installed in a test building in Leuven, Belgium. The results show that the detailed BIPV model is capable of estimating the BIPV daily energy yield with an average difference of 6.2 % (2.0 % for clear sky days) and the back-of-module temperature with an average difference of 1.74 ?C. The use of a linear power model instead of a high-resolution one-diode model affects the average differences, but not significantly: 8.7 % for daily energy yield predictions (4.5 % for clear sky days) and 1.71 ?C for temperature predictions.

Despite its advantages to contribute to meeting renewable energy targets and substitute conventional building materials, the diffusion of BIPV has so far remained well below expectations. This paper investigates barriers to and facilitators of adoption based on 43 qualitative interviews with stakeholders across the BIPV value chain. It conceptualizes a framework that classifies the determinants of the adoption processes of renewable energy technologies and of BIPV in particular. Product-specific, stakeholder-specific and institutional barriers are identified. Central product-specific barriers include high initial costs and high complexity. The main stakeholder-specific barriers are low awareness of BIPV, and the reluctance of many architects to adopt BIPV. Institutional barriers refer to political risks. The paper derives recommendations for policy makers and marketers. Successful BIPV policies should create clear incentives for BIPV adopters, either in the form of financial support or inclusion of BIPV in building codes or labels. As for marketing, BIPV suppliers should develop targeted communication strategies towards building owners and architects and offer turn-key solar roofs in order to overcome concerns about the complexity of BIPV.

In particular, one of the research lines of the project involves the construction of BIPV ceramic modules by depositing a thin film of amorphous silicon on a ceramic support. Research and development activities previously carried out by the Ceramic Centre of Bologna in collaboration with other companies have led to the production of prototype of a ceramic photovoltaic module.

The use of these modules allows the realization of active technical elements, reducing the use of raw materials. The environmental impact assessment of the BIPV ceramic module was conducted through the life-cycle approach, in accordance with the international standards of the ISO 14040 series, in order to define the eco-profile, identifying the processes with the greatest impacts and suggesting improvements.

This paper presents the life cycle impacts of the Solaire BIPV and extrapolates its performance to other facade systems. Engineering diagrams, detailed material inventories and 5?years of irradiation and actual performance data in 15-min intervals offer insights into current BIPV construction and performance. The Solaire BIPV employs waste-stream monocrystalline silicon wafers. Correspondingly, zero energy input was allocated to this BIPV from wafer production, resulting to a very low energy payback time (EPBT) and global warming potential burden (0.8?years and -10.2?g?CO2/kWh, respectively). A negative EPBT results from subtracting the impact of the thermally and structurally equivalent concrete and brick wall that the BIPV array replaced. Data from current photovoltaic-dedicated Si wafer supply were also used; these resulted with an EPBT of 3.8?years and a global warming potential of 61?g?CO2/kWh. The performance ratio and EPBT of the Solaire system were compared with those in the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Task 2 inventory database. The drawback of facade BIPV is its vertical orientation, receiving lower incident irradiation than rooftop and ground installations. Nevertheless, BIPV offers two main advantages over such installations: it does not require any virgin land for its operation, and it replaces structural units, thus avoiding the cost, embodied energy and corresponding emissions related to those. We detail herein how the replacement of traditional cladding materials can offset the performance drawback of BIPV, in terms of environmental burden and EPBT.

The trade-off between environmental and economic parameters represents a challenge for governments. The objectives of this study are: firstly, to review studies in relation to the use of PV systems in the Gulf region and secondly, to assess the trade-off between environmental and economic parameters that influence the value of building integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) technology applied into the UAE building sector. This work examines residential buildings and concludes that the economic viability of BiPV systems is subject to capital cost, system efficiency and electricity tariff. To be a cost-effective option in the UAE, subsidies for PV investments and reasonable electricity tariff must be implemented. It is suggested that BiPV systems offer cost reductions in both energy and economic terms over centralised PV plants, especially if the costs of saved operating energy and avoided building materials are taken into account. Each square meter of BiPV is capable of making a significant reduction in CO2 emissions generated by conventional power plants. This will limit the impact of global warming on the UAE and others.

This system can generate electricity during the whole year. In heating season, hot air is created to decrease heating load for the building. In non-heating season, hot water is generated to supply the household demand. Meanwhile temperature of PV panel is decreased by water cycle, therefore higher electrical performance is able to be achieved. Secondly, mathematical model is established and verified by the experimental results. Thirdly, annual performance of the system in three different typical cities are evaluated. The annual electrical generation in Beijing, Hefei and Xining are 247.7 kWh, 152.6 kWh and 268.4 kWh respectively. The solar fraction in Beijing, Hefei and Xining are 49.9%, 38.7% and 41.3% respectively. The system is able to satisfy 79.1%, 66.8% and 60.4% hot water energy demand in these cities respectively. The overall annual energy saving in Beijing, Hefei and Xining are 2661.8 kWh, 1908.4 kWh and 2412.3 kWh respectively.

A prototype of a building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) air collector was built, which is intended to perform the functions of thermal and electrical generation, light transmission and shading control. In this work, the prototype was tested under different conditions to investigate its thermal and electrical performances. The results showed a maximum temperature rise (from bottom to top) of 31 degrees C and average thermal and electrical efficiencies of 31% and 7%, respectively. The experimental data were used to build a two-dimensional model in COMSOL Multiphysics, in order to assist in the optimization of the various system components for the design of the next prototype. Simulations were performed on the glazing system to optimize the thermal output, through the use of coatings and additional glass panels. Different configurations were analyzed, and it was found that a 3-pane system with low-e coatings applied to the inside surfaces represents the best cost-effective solution, which results in a 64.7 degrees C air temperature output and a 40% increase in temperature rise over the existing prototype.

Especially in warm and sunny climates, solar electricity generation using building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) can assist in reducing commercial building loads, offering peak-shaving (power) benefits on top of the on-site generation of electricity (energy). This on-site power delivery capability gives these consumers the possibility of renegotiating demand contracts with their distribution utility. Commercial buildings that operate during daytime quite often have an energy consumption profile that is well matched by solar radiation availability, and depending on the building's available surface areas, BIPV can generate considerable portions of the energy requirements. In this work we present the role of grid-connected BIPV in reducing the load demands of a large and urban commercial building located in a warm climate in Brazil. The building and adjacent car parking lots can accommodate a 1 MWp BIPV generator, which closely matches the building's typical maximum power demands. Based on real solar radiation data and simultaneous building electricity demands for the year 2007, simulation of the annual solar generation profile of this on-site generator showed that the 1 MWp BIPV system could account for around 30% of the total building's energy consumption. In addition to the energy benefit, maximum power demands were reduced due to a good match between midday air-conditioning cooling loads and solar radiation availability on both a daily and seasonal basis. Furthermore, we have simulated the effect of this considerably large urban-sited generator on the local distribution network load, and have shown that the 1 MWp BIPV installation can also offer considerable benefits to the local utility in shaving daytime peak loads at the corresponding feeder.

It verified that the normative sky index in the weather forecasted data had the least importance as a predictor for hourly prediction of photovoltaic power output. Six different machine-learning algorithms were assessed to select an appropriate model for the hourly power output prediction with onsite weather forecast data. The recurrent neural network outperformed five other models, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, classification and regression trees, chi-square automatic interaction detection, and random forests, in terms of its ability to predict photovoltaic power output at an hourly and daily resolution for 64 tested days. Feature engineering was then used to apply dropout observation to the normative sky index from the training and prediction process, which improved the hourly prediction performance. In particular, the prediction accuracy for overcast days improved by 20% compared to the original weather dataset used without dropout observation.

Higher operating temperatures have a negative effect both on the efficiency and lifetime of the PV system. Decreasing the PV operating temperature in BiPV applications is thus a crucial aspect to both enhance the system efficiency and to decrease the temperature-induced degradation process. This study investigates the effectiveness of a passive low-cost strategy to improve the PIT performance of BiPV systems by decreasing the module temperature. It consists in the application of an heat sink system on the PV module back side to enhance the PV cooling.

This paper evaluates the cost effectiveness of BIPV system for a building in Dhaka considering the local as well as international market prices of different components of BIPV system.

This is almost the longest outdoor test of DSSCs. Performances of DSSCs prepared with two different kinds of dyes are tested. DSSCs with dye Z991 generate about 15% more electricity yearly than those with dye Z907 in the first two years and then the gap is widening because of the better stability of dye Z991. Efficiency of DSSCs with dye Z991 decreases 17% at the first two years and then becomes stable, while DSSCs with dye Z907 are out of use after 4-year outdoor testing. For BIPV use, Pm.,, increases with the solar Irradiance Pi and gets the highest value around 12:00, while the efficiency is almost unchanged from 8:00 to 16:00 as the sun moves. The output of DSSCs increases not linearly with the irradiance, especially under irradiance lower than 20 Wh, implying that efficiency measured under AM1.5G conditions is not a crucial indicator to evaluate the performance of DSSCs. The total energy yields of DSSCs throughout the years are slightly higher than that of pc-Si cell with the same installed capacity, and DSSCs generate 15-20% more electricity from May to August when temperature is higher and irradiance is lower.

The effect of CPC truncation and V-trough side wall angles were studied. The truncated CPC demonstrated much improved light acceptance outside the designed angle of acceptance when compared to the original CPC design and V-trough-like characteristics past the original design acceptance angles, consequently reducing material consumption for the manufacture of truncated CPC and therefore reduction in the cost of the system. Truncated CPCs showed optical efficiency equal to their full height counterparts, but a lower concentration ratio (4 at full, 3.6 at half and 2.7 at 50 mm height) due to an equivalent reduction of the inlet aperture size. The V-trough had a higher optical concentration ratio over 15-30 degrees angle of incidents (AoI), with the CPC taking over from 30 degrees AoI upwards. Experiments were performed on a 50 mm truncated CPC and a 22 degrees Trough Wall Angle (TWA) V-trough collector under outdoor conditions. Experimentally measured data showed good correlation with ray tracing simulation results. Both experimental and the ray tracing analyses showed the CPC concentrator achieving a 2.4% higher power output compared to the V-trough design. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the low heat exchange efficiency of air, overheating issues may occur that can reduce the electrical production of the system, as well as its durability. With the introduction of multiple intakes of air along the PV string, the goal is to improve the heat extraction from all PV panels, while achieving lower and more uniform PV temperatures. This study presents the results of a numerical investigation on the comparison of the performance of single and multiple-inlet BIPV/T systems for a possible retrofit or new buildings, with an example of a potential large scale installation on an office building. The comparison was carried out considering a cold winter and a hot summer day, under varying wind conditions, in terms of electrical and thermal performance, and PV temperature distributions. For the modelling of a multiple-inlet BIPV/T system, a flow distribution model was developed utilizing pressure drop and flow correlations, as well as wind tunnel pressure measurements representing the wind effects on the flow distributions, and a modified energy balance model for the multiple-inlet system. It was found that a multiple-inlet BIPV/T system may have up to 1% higher electrical efficiency corresponding to 7% additional power to the total output of a 120 kW system and up to 24% higher thermal efficiency, while resulting in the lowest and most uniform PV temperatures.

A 2D dynamic thermal and electrical mathematical model of the solar BIPV/T component is described and validated first in steady state under a solar simulator and later in dynamic conditions with three tests models and a 35 m(2) solar PV/T drying installation test bench mounted in situ. Finally, numerical parametric studies were performed using the validated model by varying the emissivity of some constitutive layers and the air gap thickness. These analyses have demonstrated, as expected, that, in order to cool PV modules and to increase their electrical performance, a relevant choice of their emissivity or of the metal absorber emissivity is important. Also, there is an optimal air gap thickness, of nearly 8 cm in the configuration studied, for which increasing the level of ventilation is less significant and thus permitting the reduction of extractors' electrical consumption. As further step, the annual thermal and electrical performance of the solar collector will be analysed experimentally and numerically in real conditions considering the fulfilment of fodder drying requirements.

However, its effective design remains challenging. Different but often related design concerns regarding BIPV are normally treated, in the current practice, in multiple but separated design phases with different models and tools. The complexities in maintaining the consistency between those models employed in separated phases make seamless PV and building integration, one of the major concerns of BIPV design, far from satisfying. To this end, this paper proposes a uniform BIPV design platform: e-BIM, which is a BIM (Building Information Modelling) - centric BIPV design and analysis software platform, to address the related design concerns via one uniform data model. The concept of domain-specific models is introduced to allow the external PV-related models to be integrated into the uniform model. To simplify model synchronization problem, the domain-specific views corresponding to specific domains are provided to designers and meanwhile a synchronization engine is developed to automate data consistency among views and the uniform model. The current prototype is developed based on Autodesk Revit and tested in a practical BIPV application. The results show that this platform achieves seamless BIPV design for architects, PV system designers and electricity professionals. Moreover, compared to the initial BIPV design, the photovoltaic system cost is reduced by 11.7% and the transmission losses by 2.95%.",,,,"Deconinck, Geert/H-9508-2014","Deconinck, Geert/0000-0002-2225-3987",,,,,,,,,,,,0926-5805,1872-7891,,,,MAR,2018,87,,,,,,127,137,,10.1016/j.autcon.2017.10.020,,,,,,,WOS:000426024900012,,,,,,

In the input there are known values (e.g. PV installation costs [(sic)/kWp] or present costs for the electricity [(sic)/kWh]) and unknown ones (e.g. degradation rate [%/year], maintenance costs [(sic)/kWp year] or discount rate [%/year]). The optimization is performed using the expected value out of a set of parametric scenarios generated by the unknown input values. The results show that, if capacity and position of the system are tailored on its aggregated electric demand, a large penetration of photovoltaic electricity is profitable at current prices without incentives or valorization from the grid.

The study period is 2 years, and the examined parameters are daily energy yields (normalized to module area), temperature-related losses, and soiling losses. It was noted that the final yield of a module highly depends on a combination of module efficiency in addition to the afore-mentioned performance losses. Normalized yield of bifacial monocrystalline modules are found to be the highest, while the standard polycrystalline modules generally show higher yield than other technologies due to a combination of temperature effect and soiling effect. Though CdTe and CIGS modules have the lowest temperature coefficients, their daily yields are affected by higher soiling losses. The effect of tilt angle on the temperature loss is relatively low, however, it is significant on the soiling losses where lower tilt angles result in higher soiling loss.

At this time, the main drawback with BIPV systems is the cost per kilowatt per hour of electricity generated. Besides cheaper production of photovoltaic panels, increases in their efficiency can be obtained by reducing panel temperatures. This is often achieved by adding a cavity beneath the panels to allow ventilation of the rear of the panel. However, the details of airflow in the cavity and the effect on cooling have not been rigorously researched. Life-time enhancement against degradation is also an effective technique to reduce the cost of electricity generated. Moisture ingress and thermal stresses are among the primary reasons for degradation of BIPVs; these processes are directly affected by air and moisture flow around the panels. The surface temperature thermography and airflow observations performed in this work helps to understand the transport mechanisms above and below the panels. For this purpose, a novel setup was developed consisting of a building model with a mock BIPV panel plus a solar simulator placed inside an atmospheric wind tunnel. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and infra-red thermography were performed to simultaneously monitor the surface temperature and airflow above and below the panel. The study clearly shows how the accelerated airflow within the cavity increases the heat exchange between the PV and airflow and consequently reduces the PV temperature. It is also shown that the stepped open arrangement of panels is more effective in reducing the temperature comparing to a flat arrangement. This arrangement also has a better resistant against the air and moisture ingress. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The country has abundant solar energy resource estimated to be between 4.5 and 6.5 kWh/m2/day, yet solar energy contributes less than 1% to the country's energy mix. More than 90% of the country's primary energy comes from fossil fuels leading to an unsustainable per capita carbon footprint of about 9 tCO2e. Previous research has shown that photovoltaics can significantly augment the constrained fossil fuel generated electricity supply. This paper discusses the practical application of photovoltaics as a building element in energy efficient residential housing. The study also aims to determine the feasibility of implementing BIPV systems in the residential sector in South Africa. An energy efficient solar house was designed using simulation software and constructed. Ordinary solar panels were integrated onto the north facing roof of the house. A data acquisition system that monitors meteorological conditions and BIPV output was installed. It was observed that elevated back of module temperatures reaching up to 75 degrees C on sunny days decreased module efficiency by up to 20% in the afternoon. The temperature profiles reveal that BIPV products can significantly influence indoor heating and cooling loads.

Lack of confidence in the economic viability of BIPV has become one of the critical issues in investment decisions. Therefore, there is a need to review the real economic value of recent BIPV projects to dispel the common myth of the high cost of BIPV. This paper reviews forty-five (45) BIPV projects attached to non-domestic buildings located in twelve (12) western countries between 2009 and 2018 to understand their real economic value. Levelized cost energy, net present value and discounted payback periods are estimated to identify both direct and indirect benefits of BIPV. The economic assessment revealed that projects are economically feasible when both direct and indirect are measured. Analysis further discovered that 1) curtain wall, double-skin facades, discontinuous roofs and skylights among the building application types, 2) educational buildings among the functions of non-domestic buildings and 3) c-Si among the module technologies are economically feasible performances. BIPVs are complex and unique designs with diverse economic performances. It is important to carefully select the parameters to assess the performance levels of the application before any decision is made.

The BIPV modules reduce the cooling load by minimizing the heat gain by the room in comparison with conventional double clear glass windows.

Its effect on the photovoltaic conversion of a hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector however has received little attention. In this study an investigation has been carried out to determine what effect flow distribution will have on the photovoltaic yield of a BIPV/T collector of various size. A three step numerical analysis was conducted to model flow distribution, temperature variation, and photovoltaic yield for a PV/T collector of various design (manifold sizes), geometric shape (aspect ratio), and operating characteristics (mass flow rate and flow direction in manifolds) in order to vary flow uniformity within the collector. The results revealed that flow distribution within the collector will have a significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of a hybrid PV/T collector. For the scenario where flow distribution was most uniform, photovoltaic performance was improved by over 9% in comparison to a traditional photovoltaic (PV) collector operating under the same conditions. For poor flow however, performance was only improved by approximately 2%. Parameters found to influence flow distribution include the manifold to riser pipe ratio where a ratio of 4:1 was found to be ideal and that increasing to a 6:1 ratio offered negligible improvement. Additionally it was found that array geometry (characterised by its aspect ratio in this study) plays an important role on both flow distribution and photovoltaic yield. This study has identified that the optimal mass flow rate is dependent on the shape or aspect ratio of the array. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental investigations of natural convection on a vertical photovoltaic (PV) panel exposed to solar radiations are presented. The variation of non-isothermal surface temperature of a PV is expressed with a second-order polynomial relation. In the absence of any correlation to predict the natural convection heat transfer coefficient on a PV, experimental results are presented in the form of variations of the local Nusselt numbers (Nuz), and the average Nusselt numbers (Nu), with Rayleigh number (Ra). The variations are best expressed with a power law correlation form of Nu=a*(Ra)(b) for the range 10(6)<Ra<10(8) where a and b are determined experimentally. The power-law correlations for photovoltaic were compared with a number of correlations developed from natural convection research in laboratories.

Majority of solar cells are made of silicon and performance of crystalline silicon solar cells are dependent on temperature. Power of a PV system can drop remarkably in summer when the solar irradiance is strong. It is very important to reduce the temperature of BIPV systems to improve the efficiency of electricity generation. In this paper, temperatures of PV panels with different air cooling methods have been measured. Output powers of PV systems have been evaluated based on the net output power. The temperatures of solar panels with an air channel on their backsides are higher than those of regular add-on solar panels. Nevertheless, the temperatures of solar panels naturally cooled on the backside are lower than those without any air cooling on the back side. The temperature difference can reach around 7 degrees C when the solar radiation intensity is strong. Forced air cooling can further reduce the temperature of solar panels, which is usually below 50 degrees C at high solar irradiances. At some instances, the net output power of solar PV panels with forced air cooling is greater than that with natural air cooling. The net output power of an 80W(p) solar panel can increase by 2 - 5 W.

The zero-energy building concept is primarily based on the principle that the amount of renewable energy created on the site will be equal to the total amount of energy used by the building during its operational phase throughout its entire lifetime.

Grey-box models are based on a combination of prior physical knowledge and statistics, which enable identification of the unknown parameters in the system and accurate prediction of the most influential variables. The experimental data originates from tests carried out with an air-based BIPV system installed in a Test Reference Environment. BIPV systems represent an interesting application for achieving the requirements of the EU EPBD Directive. Indeed, these systems could reduce the ventilation thermal losses of the building by pre-heating the fresh air. Furthermore, by decreasing PV module temperature, the ventilation air heat extraction can simultaneously increase electrical and thermal energy production of the building. A correct prediction of the PV module temperature and heat transfer coefficients is fundamental in order to improve the thermo-electrical production. The considered grey-box models are composed of a set of continuous time stochastic differential equations, holding the physical description of the system, combined with a set of discrete time measurement equations, which represent the data driven part.

It was produced by cutting standard crystalline silicon solar cells into narrow strips and then automatically welding and connecting the strips into continuous strings for laminating between two layers of glass. The overall energy performance of the BIPV insulated glass unit (IGU) including power, thermal and daylighting performance was investigated experimentally. The daily energy conversion efficiency of the active solar cell area was about 15% on sunny days, but it was less than 12% on cloudy days and overcast days. Due to the combined effect of both the semi-transparent PV laminate and the insulated glass unit, the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the BIPV IGU was as low as 0.25, which was much lower than commonly used glazing windows. Daylight analysis by means of high dynamic range (HDR) cameras and daylight glare probability (DGP) indicated that the BIPV IGU could reduce discomfort glare to some extent compared to clear glass windows. The net energy production of the BIPV IGU was estimated without considering the differences in HVAC energy use in this study. The artificial lighting energy consumption was about 431 W h/day while the average BIPV electricity production for the same period was 1940 W h/day. The net power generation was therefore 1509 W h/day for this BIPV IGU in Berkeley, California. Shading tests for the BIPV IGU were also conducted and the results revealed that the vertical configuration of solar cell wiring in the BIPV laminates was much more sensitive to horizontal shading patterns than vertical shading models. Thus, if shading was unavoidable in some cases, a reasonable arrangement of PV strings should be considered to bring down the energy loss as much as possible. Also, the impacts of environmental factors on the energy conversion efficiency of BIPV IGU were analyzed. Specifically, the power output declined by 0.42% of the peak power for each Celsius degree temperature rise.

A three-dimensional model is developed based on the typical BIPV facade. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with the shear stress transport (SST) kappa-omega turbulent model is used in the study. The effects of geometric configurations on the BIPV cell temperature in steady state are evaluated including the sizes of the bottom and top openings and the depth of the back air cavity (or so-called cavity depth). When the sizes of the inlet and outlet openings are the same, the effects on the decrease of cell temperature are limited. By enlarging the bottom (inlet) opening, the impact of ventilation in the cavity behind is more significant and the cell temperature decreases. Cavity depth is also a vital factor affecting BIPV cell temperature. The paper identifies the optimal cavity depth of approximately 100-125 mm. Flow disturbance and a vortex may be observed at the bottom and top of the air cavity, respectively, as the cavity depth increases which negatively affects the ventilation causing these flow disturbances to increase the cell temperature. Thermal effects of environmental conditions are compared with regard to two selected BIPV configurations. The wind velocity and the attack angle also have an obvious impact on cell temperature.

The insolation and optimum tilt angle values are based on modified HDKR (Hay, Davies, Faucher, Reindi) model which accounts for hourly insolation considering shadow effect. Electrical and thermal performance of semi-transparent BIPV thermal system is evaluated for different mass flow rate of air through the duct with series combinations. EPBT and LCC of BIPV thermal systems are evaluated for three different orientations of PV modules i.e., optimum tilt angle, horizontal and vertical orientations by considering adverse effect of shadow. The cost of energy produced by the system ranges between 1.61 and 3.61 US$/kW h depending on the climatic conditions of the place and the EPBT of the system is found to be ranging between 7.30 years and 16.9 years which is lower than the expected service life (30 years) of the modules. Both LCCA and EPBT are increased because of shadow effect but these values are decreased due to air flow through the duct which is provided below the PV module.

These include: amorphous silicon-,kesterite-, chalcopyrite-, CdTe-, dyesensitized-,organic- and perovskite-based systems. For the most part, amorphous silicon has been the workhorse in the semi-transparent solar cell field owing to its established, low-temperature fabrication processes. Excitement around alternative classes, particularly perovskites and the inorganic candidates, has recently arisen because of the major efficiency gains exhibited by these technologies.

It highlights the value of PV electricity for the GCC society from the perspective of consumers, utilities and environment. Through a systematic modelling analysis it is shown that the efficiency of PV system drops by 4-6% due to high range of module temperature and also a change in power output due to high ambient temperatures. Consequently, the outputs of horizontal and vertical PV modules are found to be less than estimates based on standard test conditions. Economically, this study shows that building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are not viable in GCC countries and cannot compete with conventional electricity sources on a unit cost basis. From a society point of view, however, the integration of PV technology into buildings would have several benefits for the GCC countries, including: first, savings in capital cost due to central power plants and transmission and distribution processes; second, an increase in the exported oil and natural gas used for electricity generation; and third, a reduction in the CO2 emissions from conventional power plants.

Roofs can also host photovoltaic (PV) modules that convert sunlight to electricity. In this study we assess the effects of installing a building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roof on an office building in Yuma, AZ. The system consists of thin film PV laminated to a white membrane, which lies above a layer of insulation. The solar absorptance of the roof decreased to 0.38 from 0.75 after installation of the BIPV, lowering summertime daily mean roof upper surface temperatures by about 5 degrees C. Summertime daily heat influx through the roof deck fell to +/- 0.1 kWh/m(2) from 0.3-1.0 kWh/m(2). However, summertime daily heat flux from the ventilated attic into the conditioned space was minimally affected by the BIPV, suggesting that the roof was decoupled from the conditioned space. Daily PV energy production was about 25% of building electrical energy use in the summer. For this building the primary benefit of the BIPV appeared to be its capacity to generate electricity and not its ability to reduce heat flows into the building. Building energy simulations were used to estimate the cooling energy savings and heating energy penalties for more typical buildings. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, an environmental analysis based on the LCA (life cycle assessment) methodology was performed using the SimaPro software.

It consists of (1) a multilevel mechanism framework, encompassing eleven mechanism categories of instruments and activities and (2) a general design framework including design principles, general project instructions and the main design guidelines. Relying on a survey conducted among PV experts on established mechanisms, the present study suggests that building codes (e.g., fire safety, structural safety, etc.) and initiatives and incentives related to PV/building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) should be the highest priority for authorities, followed by assessment of BIPV/PV properties, working toward social acceptance, conducting research projects and information exchange, and education and training activities. Considering all three pillars of sustainability, the design framework is based on the following interrelated design principles: (1) compatibility and coherence with the local context, (2) technical soundness, (3) economic viability, (4) user-centered design, (5) connecting with community and socio-cultural context, and (6) adaptability and flexibility. Despite Singapore's scarcity of land, the established design guidelines cover a wide spectrum of solutions, including PV integration into both buildings and non-building structures. The synthesis of the two interconnected and inseparable frameworks aims to create an environment conducive to long-term widespread PV integration and stimulate the deployment of BIPV, which should help Singapore and other cities reduce their dependency on imported fossil fuels, while also making them more livable and enjoyable.",,,,,"Tablada, Abel/0000-0003-3354-7726; Lau, Siu-Kit/0000-0002-2357-8281",,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,JUN,2021,13,11,,,,,,,6452,10.3390/su13116452,,,,,,,WOS:000660765500001,,,,,,

In principle, PV can be integrated directly in products, such as devices, vehicles, and buildings. Nowadays, the development of photovoltaic modules is still primarily driven by the idea of economies of scales, which leads to unvaried PV modules that are only good for large-area installations. These photovoltaic modules are not suitable for the integration into building skins, roof tiles, or electric devices because of their rigidness and their electrical constraints. Even companies which could provide a solution for these applications (flexible thin-film PV firms) are not providing customized PV modules because of the associated set-up times. This paper addresses these obstacles and the development of novel solar cell materials and manufacturing processes. A novel manufacturing process is designed to enable the adjustment of all the properties of a thin-film module on-the-fly and facilitates the production of customized photovoltaic modules with the desired voltage, size, and shape. Combined with the material characteristics given by the underlying thin-film solar cell technology, a new-breed of design-led, sustainable, and decentralised energy solutions will be able to realize.

Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) type windows are promising systems and can possess a range of semitransparent levels depending on the type of PV used. In this work, the semitransparent Perovskite BIPV windows was investigated by employing daylight glare analysis for an office building located in Riyadh, KSA and three wavelength dependent transmission spectra for colour comfort analysis. The results showed that the transmissions range between 50-70% was optimum for the comfortable daylight for south facing vertical pane BPV-windows.

Nevertheless, poor or absent ventilation under BIPV panels could cause them to overheat and reduce their efficiency. It is well established that the presence of an air gap between a photovoltaic (PV) module and roof covering facilitates ventilation cooling under the device and consequently reduces cell temperature and improves its performance. In this study, we investigated the thermal performance of PV modules installed in a real scale experimental building over a traditional clay tile pitched roof in Italy for almost one year (from August 2009 to June 2010). One PV module was rack-mounted over the roof covering with a 0.2 m air gap; the others were fully integrated and installed at the same level of the roof covering (one with an air gap of 0.04 m, the other mounted directly in contact with the insulation). Temperature and heat flux measurements for each panel, and environmental parameters were recorded. Experimental results demonstrate that even though the rack-mounted PV module constantly maintains cell temperature below that of the other full-building integrated modules, due to the presence of a higher air gap, the difference in the energy produced by the PV modules estimated for the entire monitoring period is less than 4%.

So far, the installation of such modules has been performed without esthetic concerns, typical locations being rooftops or solar power plants. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems represent an interesting, alternative approach for increasing the available area for electricity production and potentially for further reducing the cost of solar electricity. In BIPV, the visual impression of a solar module becomes important, including its color. The color of a solar module is determined by the color of the cells in the module, which is given by the antireflection coating (ARC). The ARC is a thin film structure that significantly increases the amount of current produced by and, hence, the efficiency of a solar cell. The deposition of silicon nitride single layer ARCs with a dark blue color is the most common process in the industry today and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is mostly used for this purpose. However, access to efficient, but differently colored solar cells are important for the further development of BIPV. In this paper, the impact of varying the color of an ARC upon the optical characteristics and efficiency of a solar cell is investigated. The overall transmittance and reflectance of a set of differently colored single layer ARCs are compared with multilayered silicon nitride ARCs, all made using PECVD. These are again compared with porous silicon ARCs fabricated using an electrochemical process allowing for the rapid and simple manufacture of ARC structures with many tens of layers. In addition to a comparison of the optical characteristics of such solar cells, the effect of using colored ARCs on solar cell efficiency is quantified using the solar cell modeling tool PC1D. This work shows that the use of multilayer ARC structures can allow solar cells with a range of different colors throughout the visual spectrum to retain very high efficiencies.

The interest in integration of PV among Japanese architects has increased accordingly, which has resulted in many sophisticated and innovative designs. This short communication introduces four examples of successful architectural integration from different fields. The Japanese government aims at an installed PV capacity of 4820 MWp in 2010. In parallel, the Japanese PV industry needs to develop into a strong sector which is able to operate without direct market support. The role of architects in this process should not only be to increase the volume of building integrated PV, but also to make comprehensive, integral designs, which include sunlight shading, thermal insulation, energy saving, passive use of solar energy, and obviously also photovoltaics. Furthermore, architects could make an important contribution to establishing a new, sustainable urban environment in which BIPV is used on a large scale as a distributed source of energy.

Past studies indicate that CIGS cells degrade rapidly when exposed to moisture. As a result, an effective approach to encapsulation is required for CIGS cells to satisfy the international standard IEC 61646. CIGS modules fabricated for use in large power plants can be encapsulated with glass sheets on the top and bottom surfaces and can be effectively sealed around the edges. In the case of BIPV applications, however, it is desirable to utilize CIGS cells grown on flexible substrates, both for purposes of achieving reduced weight and for cases involving non-flat surfaces. For these cases, approaches to encapsulation must be compatible with the flexible substrate requirement. Even in the case of large power plants, the glass-to-glass approach to encapsulation may eventually be considered too costly. We are investigating encapsulation of flexible CIGS cells by lamination. Sheets of PET or PEN coated with multilayer barrier coatings are used to laminate the flexible cells. Results are discussed for laminated cells from two CIGS manufacturers. In both cases, the cell efficiency decreases less than 10% after 1000 hours of exposure to an environment of 85 degrees C/85%RH.

Replacement of these buildings is not an option since affordable housing continues to be required in Chinese cities. Comfort requirements are currently increasing from previously undemanding behaviour to more energy-demanding comfort expectations. Retrofit of conditioning equipment in old buildings will lead to a significant increase in energy consumption, if the buildings are not upgraded (insulated, air tightened, etc.). Furthermore, although China is leading in the production of photovoltaic modules, the utilization of building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) is not yet implemented at a significant scale. However, the prevailing building typology is characterized by a southerly orientation, a favourable floor-to-roof ratio, a rather simple building envelope, appropriate floor plans and not at least a roof structure able to carry PV systems. Climates in many areas in China are more favourable for solar energy generation than in other countries, such as Germany, where BIPV is already widely utilized. This paper investigates the potentials of energy upgrade of a building typology representative for a large percentage of the existing Chinese building stock for 26 climates in China. Strategies of efficiency (energy-upgrade measures), consistency (renewable energy generation and revitalisation of existing structures) as well as sufficiency (reduced comfort requirements) are discussed as the pillars of a strong concept for sustainable upgrade of China's existing building stock.

Then, nanocolloidal platinum paste was deposited as a catalytic material using the screen printing method. The electrical parameters of the manufactured DSSCs with and without a counter electrode tile were characterized by measuring their current-voltage characteristics under standard AM 1.5 radiation. A dye-sensitized solar cell integrated with ceramic tiles and nickel foil was produced and displayed an efficiency of over 4%.

In order to define a unified strategy, aligning the stakeholders' views, the following disputable factors are pointed out and discussed: (1) incomplete understanding of BIPV and building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV) among stakeholders, (2) costs of BIPV systems, (3) low awareness of and confidence in integrability of PV modules, (4) incomplete knowledge about and insufficiently investigated PV performance and (5) potential of PV facade and roof integration. Since the costs are the key identified factor for BIPV implementation, life-cycle cost (LCC) assessments of PV facade and roof integrations have been performed, which supported the search for solutions to identified problems.

Several solutions on individually colored solar cells and photovoltaic modules are available and/or are under development. Those colored photovoltaic products usually generate less power than reference devices which are optimized for maximum efficiency. Color and photovoltaic energy generation are both determined by fundamental optical effects such as reflection and absorption of light. In the current paper, fundamental physical calculations are conducted in order to quantify the impact of different colors on the power loss of photovoltaics. In particular monochromatic colors are investigated by generating pill box reflection spectra and an incident solar reference spectrum. The remaining solar intensity is considered to be converted in an ideal solar cell comprised of crystalline silicon. Moreover, power losses related to standardized colors defined in the classical RAL color set are investigated. Key findings of the results are that even highly saturated monochromatic colors can be realized at relatively low power losses of less than 7%. Standardized colors result in higher power losses. In particular, Blue, Green, dark Grey, Brown and Black correspond to half the power loss determined for Yellow, Orange, Red, Violet, bright Grey and White. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The causes of capture losses were degradation of the power generation efficiency of the horizontal installation module due to the accumulation of dust and reduced energy production due to application of the same inverter for the crystal system module and amorphous module. As a result, the BIPV systems with an installation angle of 30 degrees exhibited approximately 57% higher energy production than vertically (90 degrees) installed systems under the same solar radiation.

Despite the fact that there are many examples showing that PV can be an aesthetically neutral or visually attractive element in architecture, many BIPV systems display few architectural qualities. But if well applied, PV can increase a building's character and value. Within Task 7 of the IEA PVPS programme a team of experts with an architectural background studied which key requirements needed to be complied with (design criteria for good-quality PV projects) in order to produce successful PV integration. These criteria are discussed in the article. PV is not automatically considered an indispensable material in architectural terms. This is why, no matter how well it is integrated, PV remains an 'added' element. Architects can take this as their starting point and can use one of the design approaches that are presented in the article. These criteria for incorporating PV in the building design and the design criteria for good-quality PV projects are important to architects and architectural critics in determining why a BIPV project, be it their own design or that of a colleague, is or is not aesthetically pleasing. This offers learning opportunities and reasons for follow-up or improvement options. Architects who apply PV in a well-thought-out way can make their clients very happy, and thereby contribute to a greater acceptance of PV technology.

Open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of the integrated a-Si PV cell decreases almost linearly at 0.40% for an increase of 1 degrees C until the maximum temperature (91.5 degrees C) in the experiments; while V-OC of the integrated organic PV cells decreases at 0.12% for an increase of 1 degrees C first until a significant degradation occurred at 78 degrees C. Such GFRP sections with PV cells are further examined under tensile or compressive loadings. The tensile results show that both types of PV cells can normally function up to GFRP breakage at about 1% strain. However, in compression, obvious decreases in V-OC are witnessed when a compressive strain of 0.23% on average is reached for the integrated a-Si PV cells. Such a critical compressive strain for the integrated organic PV cells is 0.25% on average. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study adopts a sociotechnical network perspective and proposes a meta-network analysis (multi-link and multi-node network) to assess complex sociotechnical systems and uses an example of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) uptake to demonstrate the approach. A comprehensive literature review and 20 interviews assisted in the development of the sociotechnical network. The adoption process is transformed to a three-node network,with nodes as social actors, technical artefacts and actions (drivers that influence the deployment). The findings reveal significant sociotechnical elements as adopters/clients: governments, BIPV panels, energy storage systems and the building.

Airport buildings in sunny and warm regions present a perfect match between energy demand and solar resource availability. Airport buildings are also typically large and horizontal, isolated and free of shading, and have a great potential for the integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.

However, under some conditions, in sunny urban areas with electricity load curves dominated by air conditioning loads, there is a high correlation between PV generation and utility feeder loads. In these situations, a considerable fraction of a given PV generator can be considered dispatchable power. In this work, we assess the potential of grid connected, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) generation in the state capital, Florianopolis, in south Brazil (27 degrees S, 48 degrees W), which is supplied by the local utility company through 56 feeders. Our interest was to identify which feeder could obtain more benefits with implementation of a PV plant with a specific nominal power. Two factors are important in this analysis: the peak demand reduction value, and the LOLP (loss of load probability, in failures per year), or LOLE (loss of load expectation, in hours per year). We analyzed the hourly demand curves of the 56 feeders and compared them with the PV power generation values obtained from a 2 kW(P) BIPV installation that has been operating continuously for nearly 10 years connected to one of these feeders. For our calculations, we defined a PV installation of 1000 kW(PAC), which corresponds to penetration level values between 10% and 20%, depending on the specific feeder considered. Our results demonstrate that the use of PV power plants can reduce significantly the summer demand peaks in regions where the load reflects commercial customers demand for midday air conditioning.

To this aim, a series of vertical heaters are cooled by natural convection of air flowing between two parallel walls. The objective of the work is to investigate the physical mechanisms which influence the thermal behaviour of a double-skin photovoltaic (PV) facade. This results in a better understanding of the related phenomena and infers useful engineering information for controlling the energy transfers from the environment to the PV surfaces and from the PV surfaces to the building. Furthermore increasing the heat transfer rate from the PV surfaces increases the conversion efficiency of the PV modules since they operate better as their temperature is lower. The test section consists in a double vertical wall, 2 m high, and each wall is constituted by 10 different heating modules 0.2 m high. The heater arrangement simulates, at a reduced scale, the presence of a series of vertical PV modules. The heat flux at the wall ranges from 75 to 200 W/m(2). In this study, the heated section is 1.6 m in height, preceded by an adiabatic of 0.4 m in height. Different heating configurations are analyzed, including the uniform heating mode and two different configurations of non uniform, alternate heating. The experimental procedure allows the wall surface temperature, local heat transfer coefficient and local and average Nusselt numbers to be inferred. The experimental evidences show that the proper selection of the separating distance and heating configuration can noticeably decrease the surface temperatures and hence enhance the conversion efficiency of PV modules.

To this end, three-dimensional (3-D) sceneries are ray-traced in CAD. The PV power output is then modeled by translating irradiance intensity data of rendered images back into numerical data. To ensure accurate results, the solar irradiation data used as input is compared to numerical data obtained from rendered images, showing excellent agreement. As expected, also ray-tracing precision in the CAD software proves to be very high. To demonstrate PV energy yield simulations using this innovative concept, solar radiation time course data of a few days was modeled in 3-D to simulate distributions of irradiance incident on flat, single- and double-bend shapes and a PV Powered computer mouse located on a window sill. Comparisons of measured to simulated PV output of the mouse show that also in practice, simulation accuracies can be very high. Theoretically, this concept has great potential, as it can be adapted to suit a wide range of solar energy applications, such as sun-tracking and concentrator systems, Building Integrated PV (BIPV) or Product Integrated PV (PIPV).

Key technologies for achieving these BIPV functionalities are developed and introduced into the 60 MW production line. These key technologies include post-scribing passivation of nano-size thin-films, large-area film uniformity, front reflective layers, 4-step laser scribing, transverse laser scribing, and peripheral pen-type junction boxes. This paper demonstrates and discusses the potential and versatility of these silicon thin-film modules in BIPV applications. It also shows that the BIPV modules' specifications and performance mainly depend on the key technologies and their associated manufacturing processes in the production line.

New system architectures have been proposed to optimize performance. The common approach of these new architectures is to track the Maximum Power Point (MPP) of every solar module individually. A simulation model is developed to quantify the benefits and drawbacks of different PV system architectures. The model includes a shading evaluation of the installation with means of 3D modeling, irradiance calculations, PV cell modeling and finally an empirical power conversion model. The energy yield of three leading architectures is confirmed (string inverter, power optimizer, micro inverter) for clear and partial shading conditions by means of an outdoor field test. Results with the irradiance profile of the Netherlands show that the string inverter system outperforms MLPE in 2 out of 3 partial shading scenarios that were evaluated in this study. It is found that the energy yield benefit of MLPE has a seasonal and latitude variation with the highest contribution during winter months. Additionally a study was performed to evaluate the energy yield at different irradiance profiles. Results show that there is a marginal benefit of the micro inverter system at higher irradiance locations when partial shading is present. The analysis method can be used by PV installers and system designer to determine which is the optimal system architecture for maximum energy yield especially when partial shading is present.

Our studies show that the yield of both the panels are comparable, with a difference of only 0.7% with the MC-Si a bit higher. However that is within the limits of power tolerance for the panels and is not conclusive. A sunny day output power profile shows the CIGS panels have a significant advantage during the noon hours with a lower voltage drop and higher hourly specific yield. Our cost analysis of CIGS solar panels show that they are potentially cheaper than aluminum composite panel cladding (including system) and only slightly more expensive than ceramic tiles (panels only). Our analysis of the solar insolation (PSH) on east and west facing sidewalls shows they are about half the insolation on the roof. Although this increases the payback period, one would need to subtract the original potential cost of the facade that it has replaced. The use of PV panels also effectively creates a double skin facade structure and provides additional insulation to the building.

The mono-, poly-crystalline silicon, CdTe, CIS and CIGS modules were mounted on two identical platforms, installed close to a row of buildings. Based on the data collected from individual or groups of modules on the two platforms, analyses focused on the photovoltaic output, considering: the mean monthly values; the influence of the neighboring buildings; the influence of the irradiance, temperature and wind in different seasons (winter, summer); the influence of tracking on each PV module type. The qualitative analysis shows that small PV platforms installed in the built environment require accurate investigations on the air currents with influence on snow and frost retention/melting and water vapor condensation. In the temperate climate, with snowy winters and rather warm summers, the best performing modules are of poly-crystalline silicon; among thin film modules, the best output corresponds to CIGS, while the steadiest efficiency corresponds to CdTe. Tracking has a leveling effect on the conversion efficiency, making the PV output more predictable during days with preponderant direct solar irradiance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence strategic placement of PV systems and shielding of conducting systems wherever possible has been recommended.

By conducting an adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) with a representative sample of Swiss homeowners planning to undertake a roof renovation project, we investigate the extent to which financial and non-financial factors drive homeowners' preferences for PV in Switzerland. We reveal that the color and country of origin of the PV modules are the main drivers for increasing share of preference for PV. In addition, we estimate the price premium that homeowners are willing to pay for building-integrated PV (BIPV) versus rack-mounted PV. We find a premium in willingness to pay of 21.79% for a roof with a BIPV installation in comparison with a rack-mounted PV installation. We further show that an increase in revenues from electricity sales (e.g. via feed-in tariffs), when transparently disclosed over an aggregated time frame, would be almost equally effective in spurring demand for PV as a decrease of initial investment costs (e.g. via one-off investment grants).

In fact, it is conceived as a stand-alone independent component, which can ensure the uninterrupted autonomous operation of a motorized shading system, even during cloudy days. In this respect, although the available power is limited, it was demonstrated that it is more than enough to cover the energy demand of high efficiency moveable venetian blinds, allowing a substantial energy saving on building's energy demand.

In each case, a uniform heat flux was applied along the top wall and the bottom wall was assumed to be adiabatic. Effect of varying inclination angle on the velocity and temperature fields is explored through the mean and turbulence quantities. A comparison between experimental and modelling results shows that open-ended channels with low inclination angles are characterised by low chimney effect and induced flow rate, thereby decreasing the heat transfer along the photovoltaic panels. In addition, propagation of disturbances and vortical structures in the channel which are necessary to enhance heat transfer are less eminent in these cases. Furthermore, heat transfer characteristics of turbulent natural convection in tilted channels are recast in terms of relevant dimensionless parameters so that they may be readily applied in cases with the aspect ratio and heat fluxes which are considered in this study.

In building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), the overall energy management of an installation must include not only the electrical output from the photovoltaic component but also the net light and heat flows as well as the temperature distributions. As the light reflectance and emittance of solar cells are strongly angle dependent, total thermal hemispherical emittance should be used instead of normal spectral emittance for accurate calculation of radiative heat transfers and hence solar cell operating temperature. Here we report the analysis of solar cell and internal glass temperature as a function of the measured total hemispherical emittance for the first time. We present a comprehensive model using total hemispherical emittance for determining solar cell and internal glass surface temperatures for insulating and laminated glazing units incorporating an operating photovoltaic cell. In warm weather (30 degrees C outdoors), solar cell and internal glass temperatures are 45-55 degrees C in laminated glass while in an insulated glazing the solar cell temperature is 60-75 degrees C and the internal glass temperature is maintained close to ambient temperature (20 degrees C indoors). We show that the solar cell front and rear emittance, location, and encapsulation method as well as the type of glazing system impact on the solar cell performance and internal glass temperatures. This study provides recommendations for designing BIPV glazing systems that minimize power loss from the solar cells while optimizing transmitted heat and shows the importance of engineering the correct front and rear solar cell emittances.

To reduce the energy consumed by indoor lighting, we propose a sensor-less light-emitting diode (LED) dimming system using daylight harvesting. In this study, we used light simulation software to quantify and visualize daylight, and analyzed the correlation between photovoltaic (PV) power generation and indoor illumination in an office with an integrated PV system. In addition, we calculated the distribution of daylight illumination into the office and dimming ratios for the individual control of LED lights. Also, we were able directly to use the electric power generated by PV system. As a result, power consumption for electric lighting was reduced by 40 - 70% depending on the season and the weather conditions. Thus, the dimming system proposed in this study can be used to control electric lighting to reduce energy use cost-effectively and simply.

The experimental and computed data fitted comparatively well through the relative error estimation after calibration.

The utilization of semi-transparent PV modules provides the benefit of low solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) as a key characteristic of window products. Meanwhile, it also produces a drawback as the remaining solar energy could be converted into heat gain which increases cooling load. Due to the excellent thermal insulation performance of vacuum glazing, the integration of STPV and vacuum glazing provides the potential to achieve the best energy-efficient performance by the low solar heat gain of the PV modules and low heat losses of the vacuum glazing.

They are (i) elliptical entry aperture; (ii) hyperbolic profile section and (iii) square exit aperture. Due to the increasing demands for stationary solar concentrators for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), this new design focuses on the use as a stationary solar concentrator. The complete optical analysis of the concentrator is carried out via 3-D ray trace technique. The analysis is based on all necessary design parameters, i.e., elliptical entry axis, concentrator height and the exit aperture geometry, in order to obtain the optimal overall optical performance of the new 3-D solar concentrator. Four different geometrical low concentration ratios were investigated: 4x, 6x, 8x and 10x. Results of the computer simulation show that the designed concentrator of 4x concentration ratio gives the higher optical efficiency of 68% compared to the other low concentration ratios. The 6x, however, gives a higher optical concentration ratio, despite having a lower optical efficiency (55%) than the 4x. A prototype of the designed concentrator was manufactured and tested under indoors conditions. The experimental results have shown an agreement by a difference of 5% with the simulation results. These results highlight how different factors need to be taken into consideration when carrying out optimisation studies. Overall, the proposed concentrator looks promising with sound results to confirm its performance and validate it as a stationary solar concentrator and thereby promote its use in WICPV.

The energy that is transmitted, absorbed and reflected in each element of the building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) modules such as solar cells and glass layers were considered in detail in the SPVHG model. Solar radiation model for inclined surface has been incorporated into the SPVHG model. The model is applicable to photovoltaic (PV) modules that have different orientations and inclinations. The annual total heat gain was evaluated by using the SPVHG model. The impacts of different parameters of the PV module were investigated. It was found that solar heat gain is the major component of the total heat gain. The area of solar cell in the PV module has significant effect on the total heat gain. However, the solar cell energy efficiency and the PV module's thickness have only a little influence on the total heat gain. The model was also validated by laboratory tests by using a calorimeter box apparatus and an adjustable solar simulator. The test results showed that the simulation model predicts the actual situation well. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Hourly solar insolation (Wh/m(2)), represented as the amount of solar irradiance collected on the ground during a 1-h period, is the most common solar radiation data available and widely used in weather files applied in building energy modeling programs (BEMPs). Because the solar beam and position vary over time, the use of hourly insolation data as the input might result in errors in the estimation of the direct incident solar radiation on a particular surface. In this study, methods used in BEMPs for direct incident solar radiation calculations are first analyzed, and an improved method adopting a new algorithm for estimating the solar irradiance is proposed. The algorithm assumes that the solar irradiance changes linearly within a 1-h period and can be estimated based on the solar irradiance at the half clock and slope. The collected direct normal solar irradiance data of 2016 from eight solar radiation stations in China were used to demonstrate the proposed method and evaluate its performance by comparing the results with those from three conventional methods used in BEMPs along with the ground truth measurements. In addition, in this study, factors affecting the accuracy of the calculation results are explored. The results of the estimated direct incident solar radiation show that the proposed method achieves the best accuracy, followed by the methods used in DOE-2, EnergyPlus, and DeST. The proposed method guarantees that the hourly direct solar insolation will remain the same and reflects the variation in the direct solar irradiance across a 1-h time frame. The proposed method can be adopted in BEMPs to improve the accuracy of the solar radiation calculation, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulated building performance and the BIPV production.

Therefore, this study proposed a Photovoltaic (PV) blind-integrated daylight responsive dimming system using LED lighting. It integrates a PV blind system with a daylight responsive dimming system, which can generate electricity and save electrical lighting energy at the same time. In addition, using LED lighting resulted in greater dimming efficiency compared to conventional fluorescent lighting. The PV blind slat angle should also be controlled according to the profile angle of the sun to maximize power generation. However, it can reduce electrical lighting energy saving indoors. To evaluate the impact of the PV blind slat angle control on such reductions in energy savings, this study conducted experiments throughout the season to identify the amount of electricity generation of the PV blind systems and the amount of electrical lighting energy savings by implementing the slat angle of blinds control. Power generation and electrical energy savings in the test room were about 32% more and 35% less, respectively, than those in the reference room. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Building integration of STPV (semi-transparent photovoltaic) elements affects deeply the building energy demand since it influences the heating, cooling and lighting loads as well as the local electricity generation. This work analyses over different window-to-wall ratios the overall energy performance of five STPV elements, each element having a specific degree of transparency, in order to assess the energy saving potential compared to a conventional solar control glass compliant with the local technical standard. The prior optical characterization, focused to measure the spectral properties of the elements, was experimentally undertaken. The obtained data were used to perform simulations based on a reference office building using a package of specific software tools (DesignBuilder, EnergyPlus, PVsyst, and COMFEN) to take proper account of the STPV peculiarities. To evaluate the global energy performance of the STPV elements a new Energy Balance Index was formulated. The results show that for intermediate and large facade openings the energy saving potential provided by the STPV solutions ranges between 18% and 59% compared to the reference glass.

This SWF is necessary to evaluate broad band-average optical properties from their spectral values, and obtain the desired rating of such bulk properties. The SWFs currently specified by rating institutions in Europe and North America for SHGC and VT are now outdated, and their inadequacies are discussed. Six potential replacements, which have been recently adopted by ASTM are described, including three direct irradiance spectra and three global irradiance spectrum incident on tilted surfaces of various tilts (20 degrees, 37 degrees and 90 degrees). Some of these spectra have been tailored for use in building energy applications, including Building-integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). The effect of tilt on the U-factor and hence SHGC of glazing systems used for skylights on roofs is discussed, using a representative dataset of 37 glazing system specimens. The spectral effects on SHGC induced by a change in the current North American SWF are also obtained for this dataset, and show small to moderate deviations from current ratings (-2% to +7% for windows, and -3% to +11% for skylights). The variations in VT are within +/- 2% for most glazing systems. To remove the current inconsistency in the SWFs used for SHGC and VT, it is recommended that a single SWF be used for both properties. For improved accuracy and reliance on active standards, it is also recommended that the SWF for SHGC and VT be either one of the two recent ASTM G197-08 global irradiance spectra, depending on application (incidence on a vertical surface for window applications, and incidence on a 20 degrees-tilted surface for skylight applications). No change in colorimetric calculations (based on the D65 illuminant) is recommended, however. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A large potential for BIPV deployment is related to building facades. The assessment of BIPV facades depends on the accurate modelling of exterior convective heat transfer coefficients (eCHTC). However, eCHTC models commonly used in BIPV modelling tend to be simplified. This paper proposes a simulation framework that combines detailed computational fluid dynamics with a multi-physics BIPV model to investigate the influence of eCHTC on the performance of BIPV facades (cell temperature and power). The evaluation is performed for different building geometries, wind speeds, wind directions, solar irradiations, and ambient temperatures. The results show that local variations in eCHTC can cause variations in cell temperature up to 42 degrees C between the BIPV modules across the facade. These temperature differences are associated with differences in power up to 17% across the BIPV facade. In general, lower temperatures (and higher power output) occur near the edges of the facade while higher temperatures (and lower power output) occur at the middle and at the bottom of the facade.

The laboratory was designed as a zero-energy building (ZEB) with PV systems installed on rooftops and facades, not maximising annual generation, but to achieve a compromise between aesthetic appeal and the energy output. Further PV systems were installed on the same site in the shapes of a carport, an electric bus (eBus) shelter and charging station, and different ground-mounted PV systems fixed at latitude tilt and single-axis tracking. Monthly analyses were carried out during the period, such as the solar irradiation availability on site, changes in the number of building occupants, the increase of installed capacity of PV systems, and energy generation and consumption. With 111 kWp, the total PV generation in the period could supply 148% of building energy needs and 97% of the Fotovoltaica/UFSC Laboratory (building plus eBus). However, there were some downtime events in certain PV systems due to R&D activities, which affected total energy production. If systems had operated at their optimal performance all the time, the laboratory could have generated 38% more energy, which means 134% of building plus eBus consumption. Therefore, the Fotovoltaica/UFSC Laboratory can be considered not only a ZEB, but a positive-energy building (PEB).

BIPV has influence on microclimate in urban environments and the performance of BIPV is also affected by urban climate. The effect of BIPV on urban microclimate can be summarized under the following four aspects. The change of absorptivity and emissivity from original building surface to PV will change urban radiation balance. After installation of PV, building cooling load will be reduced because of PV shading effect, so urban anthropogenic heat also decreases to some extent. Because PV can reduce carbon dioxide emissions which is one of the reasons for urban heat island, BIPV is useful to mitigate this phenomena. The anthropogenic heat will alter after using BIPV, because partial replacement of fossil fuel means to change sensible heat from fossil fuel to solar energy. Different urban microclimate may have various effects on BIPV performance that can be analyzed from two perspectives. Firstly, BIPV performance may decline with the increase of air temperature in densely built areas because many factors in urban areas cause higher temperature than that of the surrounding countryside. Secondly, the change of solar irradiance at the ground level under urban air pollution will lead to the variation of BIPV performance because total solar irradiance usually is reduced and each solar cell has a different spectral response characteristic. The thermal model and performance model of ventilated BIPV according to actual meteorologic data in Tianjin(China) are combined to predict PV temperature and power output in the city of Tianjin. Then, using dynamic building energy model, cooling load is calculated after BIPV installation. The calculation made based in Tianjin shows that it is necessary to pay attention to and further analyze interactions between them to decrease urban pollution, improve BIPV performance and reduce cooling load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0-7918-4737-3,,,,2006,,,,,,,499,504,,,,,,,,,WOS:000243400500059,,,,,,

Spread Hotel or Diffuse Hotel or Albergo Diffuso is an innovative concept which aims to renovate decayed buildings situated in historical locations. New economical inputs are needed to revitalize these settlements and their social tissue. Diffuse Hotel concept is very diffused in Italy due to its rich historical heritage. The present paper displays a renovation project of a rural historical settlement into a Spread Hotel. The site under analysis is located in Palazzolo Acreide, Sicily, Italy. The settlement strongly needed to be refurbished in order to provide habitability and to guarantee a proper level of comfort according to italian standards. The area is also listed in the UNESCO Heritage. The Diffuse Hotel at a national level is considered as an affordable and comfortable concept that enables the travellers to experiance Italy through a tipical, historical and comfortable hotel. The historical built enviroment preservation is strategic in Italy and can strongly support economical revitalization.

However, fixed shading devices can reduce daylight availability, increase artificial light needs and block the beneficial winter solar radiation. This paper is part of a research on the characteristics of the optimum shading device. The aim is to investigate the balance between the energy needs for heating and cooling the space that the shading device is used for and the energy that is used for lighting the same space and the energy that the shading device can produce. In order to investigate the balance between the above mentioned parameters, thirteen types of fixed shading devices have been studied and categorized according to their energy performance, for a single occupant office room. The same office room is tested for two different Mediterranean latitudes in Athens and in Chania, Crete in Greece and for two different south facing windows' sizes. The thermal behavior of the devices is assessed through computer simulation application and the daylight analysis is assessed with both computer simulation and physical modeling. Stable parameters were the internal loads in the office room, the south orientation of the facade and the type of glazing. Variable parameter was the type of the fixed shading device. The study shows that all shading devices with integrated south facing PV can efficiently produce electricity which may be used for lighting. The study highlights the fact that shading devices such as Surrounding shading, Brise-Soleil full facade and Canopy inclined double work efficiently against thermal and cooling loads and may be used to produce sufficient electricity and control daylight. The study defines the geometrical parameters that will be incorporated to the overall characteristics of the optimum fixed shading device and proposes new fields of development for the BIPV technologies.

The concept of zero energy building (ZEB) is an attractive approach in order to reduce the energy requirement of buildings leading to more sustainable cities. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is one suitable technology for providing electricity to the buildings with a minimum impact. Traditionally, photovoltaics (PV) have been installed looking for maximum yearly energy production. In this work the feasibility of PV working in non-optimal orientations will be explored by using two experimental setups: a photovoltaic facade with a southwest orientation and an architectural model of a building with the facades in the cardinal points, covered with PV. The results show interesting features, considering yearly and hourly generation profiles. Although the annual energy production for the facades and the roof is between 50% and 76% of an optimum angle installation, the fa ades have a more stable production along the year: monthly production can vary by a factor 2 vs a variation of factor 4 for irradiance. Moreover, the hourly production profiles are displaced from noon so they can match the demand. With some current net metering proposals, non-optimal orientations could even be more economical than the maximum producing orientation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A more widespread use of grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) is hindered by a number of reasons which include the declining, but still high costs of the photogenerated kilowatt hour, and the lack of knowledge about the benefits of distributed generation with PV in the urban environment. When strategically sited, PV generators integrated to building facades and rooftops in urban areas at limited penetration levels can benefit local feeders with these distributed negative loads. A number of studies have been published, with learning curves demonstrating the cost-reduction potential of large-scale PV production, and in some markets the cost of PV electricity is approaching residential tariffs, the so-called grid parity. Due to the intermittent nature of the solar radiation resource, PV is considered non-despatchable power, but under some conditions, in sunny urban areas with electricity load curves dominated by air-conditioning loads, there is a high correlation between PV generation and feeder loads. In these situations, a considerable fraction of a given PV generator can be considered despatchable power. In this work we assess the potential of building-integrated, grid-connected PV generation in the state capital Florianopolis, in South Brazil. The deployment of six different commercially available PV technologies is compared with total roof area availability, solar generation profiles, and local feeder load curves for a selected number of urban areas in the city.

Although conventional TN-LC cells are widely used to adjust the brightness in many display applications, the sheet polarizers used in such cells decay when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays and have a low light efficiency. Accordingly, in this study, a sub-wavelength metal grating PBS is used to replace not only the sheet polarizers in the conventional TN-LC cell but also the upper and lower alignment layers and transparent electrodes. Therefore, a translucent a-Si:H solar cell integrating with the novel TN-LC cell with the sub-wavelength metal grating PBS could improve power efficiency and durability in UV ray environment. The experimental results show that the transmittance gap between the on and off' states of the enhanced translucent a-Si:H solar cell/novel TN-LC cell is of the order of 26.6% (i.e. 4.3-30.9%) for incident light with a wavelength of 800 nm, 6.3% (i.e. 10.8-17.1%) for an incident wavelength of 400 nm and 2.7% (i.e. 0-2.7%) for an incident wavelength of 510 nm. Moreover, it is shown that the novel TN-LC cell increases the maximum electrical power developed by the translucent a-Si:H solar cell and improves its power conversion efficiency by 0.209% in the off state and 0.417% in the on state. As a result, the proposed device represents an ideal solution for building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, automobile industry applications and many other adjustable brightness photovoltaic applications.

This results in a better understanding of the related phenomena and infers useful engineering information for controlling the energy transfers to the building where the PV system is applied In real applications, the PV integrated double facade allows local production of electricity and heat to be employed for the building needs. Furthermore increasing the heat transfer rate from the PV surfaces increases the conversion efficiency of the PV modules since they operate better as the working temperature is lower. The test section consists in a double vertical wall, 2 in high, and each wall is constituted by 10 different heating modules 0.2 m high. The separating distance between the walls is varied from 0.03 to 0.16 m, and the convective heat flux at the wall ranges from 75 to 200 W/m(2). In this study, the heated section is 1.6 in in height. Different heating configurations are analysed, including the uniform heating mode and two different configurations of non uniform, alternate heating.

Wind speed and temperature were measured along the central line of the module, on the top (illuminated) as well as on the back (shaded) side. Short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage were determined from I-V measurements, and the maximum power was calculated. The wind and temperature patterns and the electrical performance were considerably affected by the mounting setup. The BAPV configurations were always better cooled by the wind than the BIPV setup because of the additional cooling in the air gap. Although a better cooling does not automatically guarantee a higher electrical performance, the BAPV configurations showed the highest performances in the test. In addition, the development of a boundary layer above and (in the case of BAPV) below the module and the trapping of heat into it, created a surface temperature gradient that significantly affected the electrical performance of the individual solar cells in the module. This is important because in most PV modules, solar cells are connected in series. Since the operational temperature influences mainly the open-circuit voltage, the open-circuit voltage of the whole module, and hereby the power output, will be determined by the behavior of each individual solar cell. In the tests reported here, the BAPV module with the thickest air gap (5.5 cm in this study) was the best performing configuration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-092X,,,,,AUG,2018,170,,,,,,64,75,,10.1016/j.solener.2018.05.043,,,,,,,WOS:000442713900006,,,,,,

However, from the power generation point of view, these PV modules are subjected to non-uniform illumination and partial shading due to the surrounding buildings and structures in most urban scenario. The power output of the modules do not match with the inverter rating as they do not receive direct radiation for most of the day and implementation of vertical orientation minimizes the power generation. Connecting them in series and/or parallel is an option to increase power generation, but it is highly influenced by the shading patterns. In this paper, we propose a scheme of power converters for BIPV in which each module is connected to a dedicated DC-DC power converter and the outputs of several such converters are connected to a grid-tied inverter. This configuration helps to track the maximum global power of the BIPV modules and inject power into the grid even under the partially shaded conditions.

Conventional silicon and III-V semiconductor solar cell based on crystalline bulk, quantum well and quantum dots structure or amorphous and thin film structures provided a feasible solution. However, natural dye sensitized solar cells NDSSC are a promising class of photovoltaic cells with the capability of generating green energy at low production cost since no vacuum systems or expensive equipment are required in their fabrication. Also, natural dyes are abundant, easily extracted and safe materials. In NDSSC, once dye molecules exposed to light they become oxidized and transfer electrons to a nanostructured layer of wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2. The generated electrons are drawn outside the cell through ohmic contact to a load. In this paper we review the structure and operation principles of the dye sensitized solar cell DSSC. We discuss preparation procedures, optical and electrical characterization of the NDSSC using local dyes extracted from Henna (Lawsonia inermis L.), pomegranate, cherries and Bahraini raspberries (Rubus spp.).

The selective plate, which is the main component of the BIPV RC system, exhibits high spectral absorptivity (emissivity) in the PV conversion band of crystalline silicon solar cells and in the atmospheric window band (i.e., 0.3-1.1 gm and 8-13 pm), as well as low spectral absorptivity (emissivity) in other bands.

In particular for facade integrated modules with crystalline Silicon (c-Si) solar cells alternative colors are demanded. In this paper an approach for tuning the color of standard c-Si solar cells is presented relying on plasmonic coloring. Metallic (Ag) nano-particles with a diameter of around 100 nm were created on the surface of standard c-Si solar cells. At those nano-particles plasmonic scattering at around 450 to 550 nm causes a color change from blue to green. The green color is resulting from plasmonic scattering and it is found to be insensitive to the angle of observation. A performance analysis of the c-Si cells before and after coating shows that the power of the cells is decreased by less than 10% when applying the plasmonic coating. A first test module comprising of plasmonic-green c-Si cells was carefully characterized and mounted at a test facade for building integrated modules in order to generate data in the targeted field of application. First results of the test module demonstrate that plasmonic coloring is a feasible approach to tune the color of standard c-Si solar cells for being applied in building integrated photovoltaics.

K.",,,Estimation of photovoltaic conversion efficiency of a building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) collector array using an artificial neural network,SOLAR ENERGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earlier studies have shown that the thermal efficiency of a solar thermal collector is influenced by the quality of coolant flow distribution within the array. The quality of flow distribution within a header/riser type fluid network is influenced by a number of parameters including the coolant mass flow rate, the direction of flow in the manifolds, and most importantly the geometry of the array. As a building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) collector will be a made to measure product, meaning its dimensions will be dictated by the specific roofing and energy requirements of the customer, the issue of flow distribution and its effect on both thermal and photovoltaic performance raises some concern. In order to quantify the detrimental effect flow distribution may have on the photovoltaic output of a BIPVT array, a numerical approach was presented by authors in earlier work where factors known to influence flow distribution were varied. The authors demonstrated that photovoltaic output may be severely hindered if the issue of flow distribution is not adequately addressed. In this new study we use this numerical method to additionally show that photovoltaic output is not always improved by reducing the fin width W (by increasing the number of risers for each module) despite the theoretical rise in fin efficiency F as a consequence of flow distribution. Under certain scenarios it was shown that a single riser will in fact improve PV output and also reduce system installation cost and complexity. The combination of these new finding and results previously obtained by the authors highlights the need in selecting the optimal design parameters to meet the specific requirements of each installation. The numerical approach carried out to calculate PV output however was time consuming and computationally intensive and therefore not feasible to perform for each and every customer. To address this issue, the authors have proposed in this paper to train an artificial neural network which can be used to approximate the photovoltaic yield of an array of specified shape operating under parallel\reverse flow in the manifolds and also with one or two fluid channels cooling each string of cells. By approximating the yield for each scenario, the optimal configuration can then be chosen. It was found that the neural network can be successfully trained for this specific application offering a fast alternative to the original numerical approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Supplying sufficient electrical energy, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is one of the major concerns of policymakers and scientists all over the world. In Saudi Arabia, local authorities are increasingly aware of the necessity of reducing the environmental impact of nonrenewable energy by exploring alternative sustainable energy sources and improving buildings' energy efficiency. Recently, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology has been regarded as a promising technology for generating instantaneous sustainable energy for buildings. To achieve a substantial contribution regarding zero energy buildings, solar energy should be widely used in residential buildings within the urban context. This paper examines how to achieve an appropriate model for integrating photovoltaics on the rooftop of residential buildings in Hail city to provide alternative energy sources. The estimated rooftop areas in Hail city, utilizable for PV application were calculated. Using PV*SOL simulation software, the performance ratio and the system efficiency, as well as the annual energy output in several tilt angles, were determined and presented. The amount of energy expected when using all effective roof area in the city was also calculated. The amount of CO2 emissions that could be reduced as a result of using a PV system was estimated. The results show a significant area of rooftop suitable for PV system in residential buildings in Hail city, which exceeds 9 million square meters. On the other hand, the performance ratio and the system efficiency are affected by the tilt angle of the PV module, where the efficiency increases with higher tilt angle, this is due to the PV module temperature, where, with the decrease in the PV module temperature its efficiency increases. The results indicate that the 30 degrees tilt PV produced the highest amount of energy, whereas the 75 degrees tilt PV records the smallest one although it achieves the best possible efficiency. There is a significant amount of energy produced from the use of all residential rooftops in Hail, and there is also a significant reduction in the amount of CO2 emissions. It is expected that this research would develop innovative building design strategies and specifications allowing for better climate and energy efficiency as well.",,,,"Abdelhafez, Mohamed Hssan Hassan/AAQ-9655-2021; Noaime, Emad/AAP-8520-2021; Albaqawy, Ghazy/AAP-4257-2021","Abdelhafez, Mohamed/0000-0002-5201-272X; Boukendakdji, Mustapha/0000-0003-3118-0035",,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,1845,10.3390/su13041845,,,,,,,WOS:000624771600001,,,,,,

The BIPV/T system absorbs solar energy on the top surface, which includes the photovoltaic panels and generates electricity while also heating air drawn by a variable speed fan through a channel formed by the top roof surface with the photovoltaic modules and an insulated attic layer. The BIPV/T system channel has a length/hydraulic diameter ratio of 38, which is representative of a BIPV/T roof system for 30-45 deg tilt angles. Because of the heating asymmetry in the BIPV/T channel, two average Nusselt number correlations are reported as a function of Reynolds number: one for the top heated surface and the other for the bottom surface. For the top heated surface, the Nusselt number is in the range of 6-48 for Reynolds numbers ranging from 250 to 7500. For the bottom insulated surface, the Nusselt number is in the range of 22-68 for Reynolds numbers ranging from 800 to 7060. This paper presents correlations for the average Nusselt number as a function of Reynolds number; this correlation is considered adequate for the design of BIPV/T systems where forced convection dominates. Local Nusselt number distributions are also presented for laminar and turbulent flow conditions.

This layer significantly reduces heat loss and improves the thermal efficiency of BIPV/T systems. However, the frame border that supports the glass cover casts a shadow over cells near the frame according to the air layer thickness, system orientation and location of the sun, thereby affecting photovoltaic performance. This study aims to find out the effect of such air layer on thermal and photovoltaic performance of BIPV/T systems. The distribution of frame shadows and photovoltaic loss caused by such shadows is analyzed. Then thermal and photovoltaic performance of BIPV/T system with different air layer thicknesses is evaluated. The influences caused by the air layer thickness, orientation of the BIPV/T system, solar altitude, and solar azimuth are analyzed. An approach is presented to evaluate the annual performance of the BIPV/T system. The results show that the frame shadow reduces system photovoltaic efficiency to 2.6% (normal efficiency, 13.0%) in the worst case scenario in Hefei (E117 degrees 17', N31 degrees 52'). The maximum annual electrical loss caused by the frame shadow is 70.15 kWh/m(2) at an azimuthal angle of -45 degrees. The quantity of total outputs increases with increasing air thickness.

The desiccant wheel is in charge of reducing the moisture caused by the process air and requires a hot spot for regeneration. This hot spot can be supported by solar thermal energy. This study evaluates the thermal potential of the ventilation and cooling system in a PV modules' installation. It is done according to the exploitation of the thermal energy transferred to the refrigerant as support to the hot spot, contributing to the regeneration of the desiccant wheel. For this to happen, an experimental installation has been developed, which consists of two inclined PV modules, with an air-flow channel below them. This system enables PV cells to refrigerate, thus improving the electric performance as well as making use of the residual heat generated from this process. One of the two modules is disposed of a series of plates interspersed in its cooling channel, with the aim of modifying the air flow, rising its residence time below the module and making the increase in air temperature more significant. Natural and forced convection have been tested at several air speeds for different irradiance conditions and ambient temperatures.

For some instances where the model and/or the system are interesting, BA systems are also cited.

Subsequently, the validated optical model has been used to design and optimise the proposed BIPV smart window. The effects of HPC concentration, geometric concentration ratio, thermotropic membrane thickness and glass refractive index on PV power outputs have been evaluated. Finally, a prototype of the BIPV smart window with a 6 wt% HPC membrane has been manufactured and tested under indoor conditions. From the experimental tests, it was found that the total transmittance of the double-pane glass sample with a 6 wt% HPC membrane layer decreases from approximately 90%to 14%, when the membrane temperature increases from 27 degrees C to 56 degrees C. The measured short-circuit current for the prototype BIPV smart window is up to 1.15 times higher than that of its counterpart system with a similar PV area but no membrane.",,,,,"Wu, Yupeng/0000-0001-8693-7459; LIU, XIAO/0000-0001-5161-3307",,,,,,,,,,,,0927-0248,1879-3398,,,,MAY,2021,223,,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.solmat.2021.110972,,,,,,,WOS:000626139400004,,,,,,

Large commercial building envelopes can be utilized due to their great potential of reducing building energy consumption and increasing PV integration impact, especially in climate zones with rich solar resources. Most current studies have been focused on predicting electricity generation of BIPV systems with existing envelope geometries, while few studies have discussed the generation of proper envelope shapes for PV integration due to the challenge of integrating architecture and engineering. This paper introduces a novel optimization method for BIPV shape development based on the shape grammar theory. The method reforms given building shapes/envelopes to produce a set of better BIPV shape alternatives, as well as determines the best placement and matching BIPV systems for the optimized envelopes. The main set of criteria considered during the generation and optimization process include PV power generation, PV economic impact and building energy consumption. Architectural preferences are included in generating preferred design alternatives, such as view consideration and shape direction. Commercial buildings in Egypt are used to demonstrate and validate the applications of the developed method and tool. The method and tool can help designers in achieving an optimal design of building envelope that is most suitable for maximizing PV integration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) module and its temperature are negatively correlated. It is therefore of interest to lower the temperature of the PV module by increasing the heat transfer from the PV module. The experiment and data originate from a test reference module the EC-JRC Ispra. The set-up provides the opportunity of changing physical parameters, the ventilation speed and the type of air flow, and this makes it possible to determine the preferable set-up. To identify best set-up, grey-box models consisting of stochastic differential equations are applied. The models are first order stochastic state space models. Maximum likelihood estimation and the extended Kalman filter are applied in the parameter estimation phase. To validate the estimated models, plots of the residuals and autocorrelation functions of the residuals are analyzed. The analysis has revealed that it is necessary to use non-linear state space models in order to obtain a satisfactory description of the PV module temperature, and in order to be able to distinguish the variations in the set-up. The heat transfer is increased when the forced ventilation velocity is increased, while the change in type of air flow does not have as striking influence. The residual analysis show that the best description of the PV module temperature is obtained when fins, disturbing the laminar flow and making it turbulent, are applied in the set-up combined with high level of air flow. The improved description by the model is mainly seen in periods with high solar radiation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is one of these technologies and brings its own set of challenges and problems with a resulting mutual articulation of this technology and the building. A Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approach explores how negotiations between informal groups of project actors with shared interests shape the ongoing specification of both BIPV and the building. Six main groups with different interests were found to be involved in the introduction of BIPV (Cost Watchers, Design Aesthetes, Green Guardians, Design Optimizers, Generation Maximizers and Users). Their involvement around three sets of issues (design changes from lack of familiarity with the technology, misunderstandings from unfamiliar interdependencies of trades and the effects of standard firm procedure) is followed. Findings underline how BIPV requires a level of integration that typically spans different work packages and how standard contractual structures inhibit the smooth incorporation of BIPV.

In order to develop and promote suitable energy policies for the future it is necessary to gain an understanding of stakeholder views in all countries, including those with substantial fossil fuel reserves. The volume of construction work in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has recently been at unprecedented levels, with a huge environmental impact from construction and also from potential future energy demands. The aim of this paper is to assess the potential to exploit use of a particular, but valuable, renewable energy option: building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) in those countries. Such exploitation could offset, at least in some part, the future environmental burdens. A large-scale survey, followed by a number of in-depth interviews, has been undertaken in order to examine the use of BIPV. Empirical research findings are presented, and then analysed in order to determine the current viability of a large-scale expansion of BIPV in the GCC region. The research indicates that the main factors hindering expansion are high costs and the negative public perception of BIPV in the countries concerned. Proposals are therefore provided to assist the development of suitable policies and the wider introduction of viable BIPV in the GCC markets. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Such applications may include: selection of materials for the building envelope and insulation according to the irradiation received at each point; monitoring the installation of photovoltaic systems to ensure that they are located in the optimal irradiance zones; or building restoration to improve the energy efficiency and electric generation. The proposed method enables to estimate the incidence of the solar irradiance as well as to visualize the effect it produces in every region of the buildings that compose the urban area of a city. The process includes the use of Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) information along With 5-min horizontal irradiance data. This developed algorithm has been verified through being applied to different building envelopes distributed in different geographical areas. The results demonstrate a satisfied performance which makes that the methodology can be extrapolated to any city where the LiDAR Data and irradiance information are available, permitting an accurate analysis of the solar irradiance over the building envelopes. The algorithm succeeds in obtaining a map of solar radiation captured by the envelope of any urban building that estimates the photovoltaic power generation depending on the geographic location and on the influence of shading caused by adjacent buildings. The provided results show clear evidence of the influence of the shade effect produced by both, the building itself and other nearby buildings. Even if the shading effect is a factor that determines the irradiation gradient, the orientation of the facades has been proven to be the most important parameter in seeking a higher value of irradiation. As a result, south facing walls present wider regions with greater irradiance values, which are of interest for photovoltaic implementation. In addition, monthly analyses have shown that the best-oriented facades have produce their maximum solar power during equinox months, March and September. This method is considered as a useful tool for sustainable urban planning and for building integrated photovoltaics development. Although the entire envelope of a building can be studied, this paper is limited to the analysis of the facades. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This technology is still not widely used, however. One of the reasons is that its advantages compared to traditional PV modules and solar thermal collectors are unclear. This study addresses the lack of a methodology on how to perform such comparison. It also presents a case study on how this novel approach can be used to demonstrate the actual energy and economic benefits of BIPV/T air systems compared to side-by-side PV modules and solar thermal collectors for residential applications. In this methodology, the thermal energy produced by both systems is transferred into water using a heat exchanger and the concept of annual equivalent useful thermal energy production is used to combine thermal and electrical energy. To perform the analysis, a detailed model of a BIPV/T system was developed and validated against experimental data. Then, the following systems were modeled in TRNSYS: a BIPV/T air system and side-by-side PV modules and liquid solar thermal collectors (PV + T). A case study was performed by simulating the performance of both systems on a 40 m(2) south-facing roof located in Montreal, Canada. The total energy produced by both systems was assessed by converting electricity into heat with various conversion factors. For a factor of 2, the BIPV/T system was found to produce 5-29% more equivalent useful thermal energy than the PV + T system for a water temperature at the heat exchanger inlet corresponding to 10 degrees C. Under similar operating conditions and for systems operating all year long, the acceptable cost to recover the heat from the BIPV system in order to break even with the cost of the PV + T system was found to be 7000 CAD.

Moreover, the simultaneous presence of radiation and convection related to upstream wind, in addition to the combined impact of back-ventilation and surface convection, is barely addressed in literature. However, these simplifications can result in the unrealistic loading climate conditions.

The present work is situated within these latter perspectives. This paper presents a numerical study concerning a double skin laminar flow in a vertical DSF-channel asymmetrically heated under realistic environmental conditions. Finite volume based commercial software Ansys Fluent is used to solve the governing equations. Our interest for this work is to study: (i) the influence of the vertical spacing (0<S<A) between two identical heat sources (PV panels) on a facade, (ii) the influence of the alternation of numerous heat sources on the two channel facades, on the flow dynamics and heat transfer. The current numerical results were compared to those that were found experimentally with a very good agreement between them. They showed that the flow characteristics inside the DSF-channel strongly depend on the spacing between the two heat sources.

In the cool approach of the arrangement (I), the outdoor air stream enters the HRW and is precooled there by exchanging heat to the building exhaust air.

As an innovative building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) window, the vacuum PV glazing was proposed to provide excellent thermal performance and utilize renewable energy. However, the daylighting performance of the vacuum PV glazing and the effect on energy consumption have not been thoroughly investigated. Most whole building energy simulation used the daylighting calculation based on Daylight Factor (DF) method, which fails to address realistic calculation for direct sunlight through complex glazing materials. In this study, a RADIANCE model was developed and validated to adequately represent the daylight behaviour of a vacuum cadmium telluride photovoltaic glazing with a three-layer structure. However, RADIANCE will consume too many computational resources for a whole year simulation. Therefore, an artificial neuron network (ANN) model was trained based on the weather conditions and the RADIANCE simulation results to predict the interior illuminance. Subsequently, a preprocessing coupling method is proposed to determine the lighting consumption of a typical office with the vacuum PV glazing. The performance evaluation of the ANN model indicates that it can predict the illuminance level with higher accuracy than the daylighting calculation methods in EnergyPlus. Therefore, the ANN model can adequately address the complex daylighting response of the vacuum PV glazing. The proposed coupling method showed a more reliable outcome than the simulations sole with EnergyPlus. Furthermore, the computational cost can be reduced dramatically by the ANN daylighting prediction model in comparison with the RADIANCE model. Compared with the lighting consumption determined by the ANN-based coupling method, the two approaches in EnergyPlus, the split-flux method and the DElight method, tend to underestimate the lighting consumption by 5.3% and 9.7%, respectively.",,,,"Wang, Meng/AAL-7860-2021; Yang, Hongxing/E-5737-2014","Wang, Meng/0000-0001-8178-844X; , Yun Kyu/0000-0003-0839-9928; Yang, Hongxing/0000-0001-5117-5394",,,,,,,,,,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,APR 1,2020,263,,,,,,,,114624,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114624,,,,,,,WOS:000520402600020,,,,,,

As a result some exciting high-profile building projects with PV have been built, for example, the small service pavilion Meereslauschen in Steinhude or the new headquarters building of the Wood Trade Association in Munich. These projects show that the use of PV is very varied and offers opportunities for creative architects. However non-technical problems still need to be solved to allow a meaningful and widespread application of PV in the built environment. To decrease costs it is essential to develop further standard BIPV components.

Effective thermal regulation of BIPV is of great importance because the undesirable heat produced by photovoltaic (PV) modules will not only decrease the energy conversion efficiency, but also increase the building cooling load. The photovoltaic double skin facade (PV-DSF), regarded as one of the most feasible approaches to mitigate these problems, has been widely adopted and constructed globally. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on PV-DSFs in terms of both energy performance and heat transfer characteristics. The energy performance of PV-DSFs involves a combination of energy supply from PV systems and energy demand for indoor heating, cooling and lighting. Investigations on the air flow and heat transfer characteristics in PV-DSFs are essential for understanding the heat transfer mechanisms and optimizing the system configurations.

In this perspective, we assess the case for market deployment of BIPV windows, specifically intended for commercial U.S. high-rise buildings. Research and development on solar powered windows has been predicated on the hypothesis that sunlight-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device cost per unit area are the key figures of merit that might drive market adoption. Here we investigate the market landscape and desirability for solar powered windows by identifying and evaluating the customer needs for the commercial high-rise building window market. In the course of this assessment, we performed 150 interviews with experts across the value chain for commercial windows. We found that the market forces are complicated by a misalignment of incentives between the end users of BIPV windows and the key decision makers for building projects that could incorporate this technology. Our assessment leads us to frame new figures of merit for BIPV windows that address the underlying needs of prospective customers as well as technical metrics for energy generation. We finally discuss one possible direction for BIPV window technology in which photovoltaics are integrated with switchable windows. Here, the integrated PV converts visible and infrared light transmission into useable electricity enabling standalone, self-powered active windows that can potentially address market needs for smart windows, thereby enabling a pathway for BIPV window deployment.

A well known highly efficient collector is the open-loop unglazed transpired collector (UTC) which consists of dark porous cladding through which outdoor air is drawn and heated by absorbed solar radiation. Commercially available photovoltaic systems typically produce electricity with efficiencies up to about 18%. Thus, it is beneficial to obtain much of the normally wasted heat from the systems, possibly by combining UTC with photovoltaics. Combination of BIPV/T and UTC systems for building facades is considered in this paper - specifically, the design of a prototype facade-integrated photovoltaic/thermal system with transpired collector (BIPV/T). A full scale prototype is constructed with 70% of UTC area covered with PV modules specially designed to enhance heat recovery and compared to a UTC of the same area under outdoor sunny conditions with low wind. The orientation of the corrugations in the UTC is horizontal and the black-framed modules are attached so as to facilitate flow into the UTC plenum. While the overall combined thermal efficiency of the UTC is higher than that of the BIPV/T system, the value of the generated energy - assuming that electricity is at least four times more valuable than heat - is between 7% and 17% higher. Also, the electricity is always useful while the heat is usually utilized only in the heating season. The BIPV/T concept is applied to a full scale office building demonstration project in Montreal, Canada. The ratio of photovoltaic area coverage of the UTC may be selected based on the fresh air heating needs of the building, the value of the electricity generated and the available building surfaces.

The vertically placed BIPV systems are able to cover larger areas of buildings' surfaces, as compared with conventional rooftop PV systems, and reach their peak of production during winter and spring, which renders them suitable for energy harvesting especially in urban areas. Driven by both these relative advantages, the proposed strategy aims to maximize the district's autonomy from the external grid, which is achieved through the cooperation of interactive buildings. Therefore, the major contribution of this study is the management and optimal cooperation of a group of buildings, each of which is equipped with its own system of vertical BIPV panels and BESS, carried out by an MPC strategy. The proposed control scheme consists of three main components, i.e., the forecaster, the optimizer and the district, which interact periodically with each other. In order to quantitatively evaluate the benefits of the proposed MPC strategy and the implementation of vertical BIPV and BESS, a hypothetical five-node distribution network located in Greece for four representative days of the year was examined, followed by a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of the system configuration on its performance.",,,,,"Rakopoulos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-4948-4862",,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,JUN,2021,14,12,,,,,,,3369,10.3390/en14123369,,,,,,,WOS:000666039700001,,,,,,

In other words, a PVT system can improve the electricity efficiency of BIPVs while using the waste heat of BIPVs as a source of thermal energy for the building. By generating thermal and electrical energies simultaneously, PVT systems can improve the utilization of solar energy while enhancing the energy performance of buildings. To optimize the performance of an air-type PVT collector, it is necessary for the system to extract more heat from the PV module. Consequently, this approach decreases PV temperature to improve PV electrical energy generation. The thermal and electrical performance of an air-type PVT collector depends on its design, which affects airflow and heat transfer. Moreover, the performances of the PVT collector can differ according to the coupled facility in the building. In this study, the thermal and electrical performances of an advanced air-type PVT collector with a direct expansion air handling unit (AHU) were analyzed experimentally. For this purpose, six prototypes of an advanced air-type PVT collector were developed. Furthermore, a direct expansion AHU with a heat recovery exchanger (HRX) was designed and built. The advanced PVT collectors with a total capacity of 740 Wp were installed in an experimental house and were coupled to the direct expansion AHU system with a maximum airflow of 700 CMH. The performance of PVT collectors was analyzed and compared with the BIPV system. Results showed that building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) collectors produced 30 W more power than the BIPV system. When operating the AHU system, the temperature of the BIPVT collector was generally lower than the BIPV. The maximum difference in temperature between BIPVT and BIPV was about 22 degrees C.

The study focuses upon a Northern European climate and the significance of module orientation upon energy yield across diurnal, seasonal change and climatic conditions are discussed. It is shown that the optimum position of a BIPV facade depends upon season and that a south facing BIPV facade provides the greatest energy yield during winter months. The results also show how west-facing modules can significantly contribute to power generation during peak power periods (5-8 p.m.), which is imperative for balancing energy demand for buildings of the future and in particular supply the energy needs of buildings during peak hours in Northern Europe. Electrical characteristics under standard and part-load conditions were collated from laboratory scale OPV module experimental data and scaled for commercial-size modules in order to simulate BIPV arrays based upon OPVs. The simulated data is compared to experimental data and the closeness shows that BIPV systems based upon OPVs can be accurately simulated prior to installation. The system simulations compare typical energy demand profiles of small commercial buildings and illustrate that OPV arrays show strong potential to be used with excess energy generation for 8 months of the year based upon a 4.22kWp OPV system. Four 4.22kWp OPV systems scenarios have been investigated for (1) the highest annual energy generation, (2) architecturally evenly-spaced around the building (avoiding a North facade), (3) grid-balancing and (4) East-West split. Whilst Scenario 4 shows the lowest overall energy yield over the course of the year, energy production during peak hours is substantially higher than in other scenarios.

A social construction of technology (SCOT) analysis documents how the energy generation of BIPV disappeared from view at certain points as actors focused on building features. A contribution is made to the theoretical development of SCOT by responding to two issues: privileging of cognitive closure mechanisms and the neglect of institutional analysis. The concept of inflection mechanisms is introduced as a second type of closure mechanism.

Architects and building owners need these tools in order to determine if the potential energy savings realized from building integrated photovoltaics justifies the additional capital expenditure. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks to provide high quality experimental data that can be used to develop and validate these predictive performance tools. The temperature of a photovoltaic module affects its electrical output characteristics and efficiency. Traditionally, the temperature of solar cells has been characterized using the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT), which can be used in conjunction with a calculation procedure to predict the module's temperature for various environmental conditions. NOCT procedure provides a representative prediction of the cell temperature, specifically for the ubiquitous rack-mounted installation. The procedure estimates the cell temperature based on the ambient temperature and the solar irradiance. It makes the approximation that the overall heat loss coefficient is constant. In other words, the temperature difference between the panel and the environment is linearly related to the heat flux on the panels (solar irradiance). The heat transfer characteristics of a rack-mounted I'll module and a BIPV module can be quite different. The manner in which the module is installed within the building envelope influences the Cell's operating temperature. Unlike rack-mounted modules, the two sides of the modules may be subjected to significantly different environmental conditions. This paper presents a new technique to compute the operating temperature of cells within building integrated photovoltaic modules using a one-dimensional transient heat transfer model. The resulting predictions are compared to measured BIPV cell temperatures for two single crystalline BIPV panels (one insulated panel and one uninsulated panel).

In this context the development of products with the best compromise between electrical efficiency and control of transparency will see the most competition between competing companies and those that win this battle will inevitably come to be successful in the market.

The hourly solar irradiation on each of the building surfaces over one year period is calculated using CitySim simulations, while taking the effects of irradiation threshold for roof and facades into account.

Some of the integration strategies, however, change the boundary conditions in which the PV systems work. Indeed, when embedded in the fa ade or in shading devices elements, the effects of partial shading and actual thermal conditions on power production need to be taken into account. In this work, suitable PV models to estimate the performance of such systems and to analyse the effects of partial shading are introduced and validated against measurements. In order to model the whole system, a detailed optical-thermal electrical model is developed. The electrical model is based on a five parameter PV cells equivalent circuit and it is coupled to a dynamic thermal model and to a specific irradiance calculation method. At the same time, a simplified model is developed to reduce the computational time. A dedicated experimental apparatus, built to reproduce the typical mutual shading conditions that might occur in shading devices, has been used to assess the accuracy of the model predictions - in terms of array voltage, current and cell temperature - and to analyse the effects of mismatching on the shaded cells. The results show that both the detailed and the simplified models predict the electric power production with good accuracies, with daily averaged relative errors between 2% and 10% and with the main deviations occurring during severe mismatching conditions. In such conditions the accuracy of the simulations can be significantly improved using the detailed model and shortening the simulation time-step. Indeed, a model sensitivity analysis has been performed, showing that the detailed model represents adequately the physical response of the PV system to variable environmental conditions, but the results of the simulations are very sensitive to the input data (geometrical tolerances and time-step) during partial shadings. Concerning the thermal model, both stationary and dynamic approaches provide temperature predictions accurate enough for daily power estimations. Nevertheless, the dynamic approach is able to better describe the cell temperature and is necessary for time-steps below the characteristic time of the system. Thus, the detailed optical-thermal-electrical PV model proposed demonstrated to be a valuable tool to investigate the effects of building integration of PV systems, allowing designers to evaluate electrical and thermal effects (e.g. power losses, hot spots). It can also be used for the assessment of simplified models. The simplified model demonstrated to provide comparable results - while requiring less computational effort- respect to the detailed model, thus being suitable to be integrated in long term simulations (i.e. building simulations for early performance evaluation).",,,,"Dama, Alessandro/AAJ-1038-2020","Dama, Alessandro/0000-0002-5886-0316; Piccoli, Emanuele/0000-0002-2496-626X",,,,,,,,,,,,0038-092X,,,,,MAY 1,2019,183,,,,,,356,370,,10.1016/j.solener.2019.03.015,,,,,,,WOS:000467892000033,,,,,,

Residential buildings are responsible for 23% of the national electricity demand. Thus, it is necessary to search for new energy sources to both diversify and complement the energy mix. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is building momentum worldwide and can be an interesting alternative for Brazil due its solar radiation characteristics. This work analyses the potential of seven BIPV technologies implemented in a residential prototype simulated in three different cities in Brazil (Natal, Brasilia and Florianopolis). Simulations were performed using the software tool EnergyPlus to integrate PV power supply with building energy demand (domestic equipment and HVAC systems). The building model is a typical low-cost residential building for middle-class families, as massively constructed all over the country. Architectural input and heat gain schedules are defined from statistical data (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica-Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and Sistema de Informacoes de Posses de Eletrodomesticos e Habitos de Consumo-Consumer Habits and Appliance Ownership Information System (SIMPHA)). BIPV is considered in all opaque surfaces of the envelope. Results present an interesting potential for decentralized PV power supply even for vertical surfaces at low-latitude sites. In each facade, BIPV power supply can be directly linked to local climatic conditions. In general, for 30% of the year photovoltaic systems generate more energy than building demand, i.e., during this period it could be supplying the energy excess to the public electricity grid. Contrary to the common belief that vertical integration of PV is only suitable for high latitude countries, we show that there is a considerable amount of energy to be harvested from vertical facades at the sites investigated.

The optoelectronic properties of the fabricated cells showed that the HB layers improved the fill factor by decreasing shunt loss and increased the short-circuit current density by enhancing generated-carrier collection. We used scattering matrix analysis to simulate the transmittance characteristics of the semitransparent solar cells fabricated using the HB layers and showed that the HB layers shifted the transmission peak to longer wavelengths. We used a figure of merit (FOM), the product of the efficiency and the average transmittance in the range 400-800 nm, to represent the performance of the semitransparent solar cells and compared the FOMs of the cells fabricated for application to BIPV windows. The cell fabricated using triple HB layers showed the highest FOM, more than 20% higher efficiency than the reference cell (fabricated without using any MB layers), and its transmittance was similar to that of the reference cell.

This paper investigates the potential power gain provided by these MICs in situations where the architecture or surroundings of a building necessitate that a PV array include panels with differing orientations, which can significantly reduce system efficiency. A flexible, comprehensive simulation model for BIPV systems is developed, which allows for variations in insolation and temperature at the PV cell level, while accurately modeling MICs and their effect on array performance. This model is used to simulate various directional array combinations in series string and parallel configurations for a representative set of climates around the US. Results of these simulations show power gains attributed to both the photovoltaic generator/converter portion of the system and to increased inverter efficiency arising from a constant, controlled string voltage.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is addressing this deficiency by evaluating computer models used to predict the electrical performance of BIPV components. To facilitate this evaluation, NIST is collecting long-term BIPV performance data that can be compared against predicted values. The long-term data, in addition, provides insight into the relative merits of different building integrated applications, helps to identify performance differences between cell technologies, and reveals seasonal variations. This paper adds to the slowly growing database of long-term performance data on BIPV components. Results from monitoring eight different building-integrated panels over a 12-month period are summarized. The panels are installed vertically, face trite south, and are an integral part of the building's shell. The eight panels comprise the second set of panels evaluated at the NIST test facility Cell technologies evaluated as part of this second round of testing include single-crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, and two thin film materials: tandem-junction amorphous silicon (2-a-Si) and copper-indium-diselenide (CIS). Two 2-a-Si panels and two CIS panels were monitored. For each pair of BIPV panels, one was insulated on its back side while the back side of the second panel was open to the indoor conditioned space. The panel with the back side thermal insulation experienced higher midday operating temperatures. The higher operating temperatures caused a greater dip in maximum power voltage. The maximum power current increased slightly for the 2-a-Si panel but remained virtually unchanged for the CIS panel. Three of the remaining four test specimens were custom-made panels having the same polycrystalline solar cells but different glazings. Two different polymer materials were tested along with 6 mm-thick, low-iron float glass. The two panels having the much thinner polymer front covers consistently outperformed the panel having the glass front. When compared on an annual basis, the energy production of each polymer-front panel was 8.5% higher than the glass-front panel. Comparison of panels of the same cell technology and comparisons between panels of different cell technologies are made on daily, monthly, and annual bases. Efficiency based on coverage area, which excludes the panels inactive border is used for most between panel comparisons. Annual coverage-area conversion efficiencies for the vertically-installed BIPV panels range from a low of 4.6% for the 2-a-Si panels to a high of 12.2% for the two polycrystalline panels having the polymer front covers.

To evaluate the limits and competitiveness of PV energy in Spain, several companies, utilities and institutions have been working together in a project called FotoRED. Within this project, several computer tools have been developed to analyse the potential of connecting photovoltaic stations to the utility grid. One of these tools is the simulator presented here, a program to estimate the energy balance and economic behaviour of grid-connected PV buildings. Depending on several construction parameters of the building, the photovoltaic generators installed, the geographical location, weather conditions, etc., the program estimates the energy consumed in the building, the photovoltaic energy that can be generated on-site and the resulting energy balance on a daily, monthly and yearly basis. The economic behaviour of the building can also be simulated over a 30-year period, generating cash-flow diagrams, investment payback curves and other economic information to describe the building's expected performance. Many building designs and several existing buildings have been simulated with this tool so far. One example of these is presented and the conclusions reached during several simulation runs are discussed.

On the one hand there is the need for finding a balance between the preservation of the aesthetic appearance and the historical values, but on the other hand, finding the space where to effectively integrate the systems might be quite challenging. The solar systems can be divided in photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal (ST) systems. Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) and Building Integrated Solar Thermal (BIST) are PV or ST panels integrated into the building envelope, combining the energy generation with other functions, such as noise, weather protection, thermal insulation, sun shadow, and other aspects. Nowadays, the dynamism of the market allows to design highly compatible products which look like traditional architecture materials. This situation fosters the integration of these products in the BIPV and BIST systems within the heritage sites, especially thanks to the use of advanced customisation processes, special and low-reflecting glasses, and innovative cost-competitive coatings. There is a limited number of studies on the application of these technologies in heritage contexts, due to the presence of architectonic, conservative, and cultural barriers. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the available literature on the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in heritage sites and buildings, which would foster the preservation of their cultural and natural values as well as reducing primary energy consumption, increasing comfort levels, minimizing environmental impacts, and improving technical quality and economical outlays. A common framework will thus defined to support restorers, historic conservators, and energy experts and to facilitate the diffusion and application of RES in heritage contexts. This conceptual framework will provide industries and academics with operative strategies and will encourage their diffusion and application in sensible contexts.",,,,,"Polo Lopez, Cristina Silvia/0000-0001-6590-1043",,,,,,,,,,,,1757-8981,,,,,,2020,949,,,,,,,,12113,10.1088/1757-899X/949/1/012113,,,,,,,WOS:000647639100116,,,,,,

Optical and electrical properties of the i-layers are described. These properties are linked to the microstructure and hence to the i-layer deposition rate, that in turn, affects throughput in production. The importance of contact and reflection layers in achieving low electrical and optical losses is explained, particularly for the superstrate case. Especially the required properties for the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) need to be well balanced in order to provide, at the same time, for high electrical conductivity (preferably by high electron mobility), low optical absorption and surface texture (for low optical losses and pronounced light trapping). Single-junction amorphous and microcrystalline p-i-n-type solar cells, as fabricated so far, are compared in their key parameters (J(sc), FF, V-oc) with the 'theoretical' limiting values. Tandem and multijunction cells are introduced; the muc-Si: H/a-Si: H or 'micromorph' tandem solar cell concept is explained in detail, and recent results obtained here are listed and commented. Factors governing the mass-production of thin-film silicon modules are determined both by inherent technical reasons, described in detail, and by economic considerations. The cumulative effect of these factors results in distinct efficiency reductions from values of record laboratory cells to statistical averages of production modules. Finally, applications of thin-film silicon PV modules, especially in building-integrated PV (BIPV) are shown. In this context, the energy yields of thin-film silicon modules emerge as a valuable gauge for module performance, and compare very favourably with those of other PV technologies.

The importance of BIPV and facade utilization in new city developments is discussed, along with key questions raised by the commercial developer regarding the practical implementation of BIPV solutions. Based on feedback from the building industry, a simplified model has been implemented to evaluate surface areas producing a profit or a loss over the PV system lifetime. As tilted photovoltaic (PV) modules installed on flat roofs are not building integrated, three simulation variants have been performed for flat roofs with a small inclination up to ten degrees. For some buildings this will give a small gain in annual PV production and payback time.

This work focuses on the real opinion of the citizens about the aesthetic impact resulting from the use of photovoltaic systems in buildings. A survey was conducted using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to evaluate the feelings through two classic dimensions of affect: hedonic valence (pleasant-unpleasant) and arousal (activation or emotional intensity). Overall, results (error range of 5%) show that all the prototypes were rated positively and with a medium level of arousal, although the integrated systems obtained higher values in both dimensions of affect.

To fill this research gap, a systematic review of the literature on PVSD was conducted. The current body of knowledge on PVSD is summarized, including aspects such as PVSD types, PV material, orientations, tilt angles, and research approaches. Several noteworthy conclusions are drawn based on the quantitative analysis of 43 journal papers on PVSD. The majority of the studies are South Korea-based (35.9%), followed by China, Greece, and Switzerland. In addition, the focus of the literature has been on the technical approach (76.5%), office building (73.3%), and equator-facing orientation (57.1%). Only 15 types of PVSD have hitherto been studied, with the emphasis on two types: the inclined single panel and horizontal louvres between double layers. Moreover, 21 architectural cases of PVSD in practice are presented and two obstacles to PVSD development are discussed. Suggestions for future study are made, including intensifying the focus on PVSD in countries with the significant solar source, such as Singapore and Australia; diversifying the exploration of multiple PVSD types (instead of only two types); and emphasizing multi-objective optimization studies on PVSD.

Using a typical magnetron sputtered InSnO (ITO) anode and a low energy sputtered InZnSnO (IZTO) cathode, we fabricated bidirectional transparent electrodes for semi-transparent PSCs. In particular, by the sequential sputtering of a thin buffer and then a thick dense IZTO layer (two-step sputtering), we fabricated a transparent IZTO cathode for a p-i-n planar type PSC without any plasma damage. Compared to the power conversion efficiency (PCE 3.43%) of PSCs with an ITO cathode prepared by typical DC magnetron sputtering, the PSC with a two-step sputtered IZTO cathode showed a much higher PCE (15.72%) due to the absence of plasma damage. The high PCE of the semi-transparent PSC with IZTO cathode is comparable to the PCE (17.04%) of an opaque PSC with opaque Ag cathode. Furthermore, with diluted perovskite solution, we able to achieve PCE of 13.61% and AVT of 24.70% both high enough to use as PSC for BIPV. These results demonstrate that the two-step linear facing target sputtering (FTS) process is a feasible approach to make high-quality transparent top cathodes for semi-transparent PSCs.

In regions in which there is a shortage of free land and no fossil fuel reserves, building-integrated photovoltaics with an additional attribute of semitransparency (BISTPV) can help to realize sustainable economic growth. The net electricity savings in dwellings and commercial edifices can be substantially enhanced by using BISTPV shrewdly. In addition to building applications, semitransparent (ST) solar cells can be used in yacht hatches, signboards on express-ways, automobiles, electronic displays, and other applications. It is anticipated that in the foreseeable future, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells, and chalcopyrite solar cells based BISTPV modules will replace aesthetically repulsive c-Si-based ST modules, which are currently the key player in the BIPV market. DSSCs are superior to a-Si:H and chalcopyrite-based PV in terms of the appropriate choice of dyes, for which wavelengths that have a low eye sensitivity factor can be selectively harnessed. The transparency, or ability to see-through, can be further increased by making use of highly transparent photoanodes and counter electrodes. However, the stability issues that are associated with DSSCs have halted their propagation to the BIPV market. In contrast, ST a-Si:H solar cells have been well developed on a laboratory scale, and ST panels made by various companies are available on the market. Apart from ST DSSCs and a-Si:H solar cells, which have evolved considerably, chalcopyrite STPV has only recently started the journey of its development on a laboratory scale although it has a large potential for BISTPV. Therefore, considerable efforts must be made for it to emerge in the BIPV market.

This paper discusses a novel type of non imaging optical concentrator that can be used to reduce the capital cost of a BIPV system. This new concentrator, known as rotationally asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (RACPC), has a flat entrance aperture that facilitates integration within a double-glazing window and reduces fabrication costs. The RACPC, which has a geometrical concentration of 3.66x, also offers other advantages over conventional solar concentrators: suitability for fenestration, ease of integration with square PV cells, and passive tracking. Several experiments were carried out on a double-glazing solar window incorporating an array of 4x3 concentrator-PV cells. The experiments were carried out indoors under standard test conditions.

In spite of the fact that the earth and its atmosphere continually receive 1.7 x 10(17) watts of radiation from the sun, in the portfolio of sustainable and environment friendly energy options, which is about 16% of the world's energy consumption and mostly met by biomass, only a paltry 0.04% is accredited to solar. First and second generation solar cells offer mature technologies for applications. The most important difficulty with regards to integration with structures is not only the additional cost, but also the lack of sufficient knowledge in managing the available energy smartly and efficiently. The incorporation of PV as a part of building fabric greatly reduces the overall costs compared with retrofitting. BIPV (Building Integrated photovoltaic) is a critical technology for establishing aesthetically pleasing solar structures.

However, glass replacement with advanced PV concepts needs thorough energy and environmental assessment, since it took more than a millennium to produce transparent window glass of high visibility. Despite the many published studies in relation to the performance of each technology, there are limited comparative investigations of the proposed PV integration options and the most appropriate integration solutions for different climatic regions. Here, we report, for the first time, on the energy performance of four BIPVs that control solar radiation through windows and their effect on the built environment for three different climatic zones. The evaluation was done through TRNSYS simulations and calculation of representative indexes associated with thermal and visual comfort. A BIPV-flexibility index, given as a ratio of self-sufficiency to self-consumption, is proposed as a figure of merit for the assessment of each BIPV technology's electricity production and its effect on building energy performance. The findings clearly show that BIPVs could substantially contribute to the transition to zero energy buildings due to their passive energy benefits (up to 43% savings) in addition to their electricity production. Opaque module, PV shadings and PV windows optimize the BIPV-flexibility index (up to 0.57) for cold, moderate and hot climates, with acceptable indoor thermal (up to 54% of time) and visual (up to 83% of time) comfort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,AUG 1,2021,295,,,,,,,,117017,10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117017,,,,,,,WOS:000663600400002,,,,,,

Integrating PV (photovoltaics) in shading systems opens new opportunities for BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics) on facades. A key problem of such systems is mutual shading among PV modules as it can lead to electrical mismatch losses and overheating effects. In this work, we present a new modeling framework, which couples parametric 3D with high-resolution electrical modeling of thin-film PV modules to simulate electric energy yield of geometrically complex PV applications. The developed method is able to predict the shading pattern for individual PV modules with high spatio-temporal resolution, which is of great importance for electrical system design. The methodology is applied to evaluate the performance of different dynamic BIPV shading system configurations, as well as its sensitivity to facade orientation and module arrangement. The analysis shows, that there is a trade-off between tracking performance and mutual shading of modules. Distance between modules is a critical parameter influencing the amount of mutual shading and hence limiting solar irradiation and electricity generation of PV shading systems using solar tracking. Planning of module string configuration, PV cell orientation, and location of bypass diodes according to partial shading conditions, reduces electrical mismatch losses and results in significantly higher electricity generation. The integration of parametric 3D and electrical modeling opens new possibilities for PV system design and dynamic control optimization.

Performance enhancement of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels by passive cooling has been investigated both experimentally and with computational modeling. It has been shown that mounting the BIPV with a narrow channel can reduce the operating temperature of the photovoltaic panel. This enhancement in the heat transfer from the PV panel results in decreasing the average temperature of the PV panel from 5 to 10 degrees C. Results show that having a 30 cm channel beneath the panel can increase the electrical output by 3-4%. This increase in PV output can translate into a significant amount over the life cycle of a given PV module. Various channel aspect ratios have been tested in order to correlate the enhancement in performance to the cooling channel geometry. There is significant consistency between the experimentally measured PV panel surface temperatures and those obtained from the computational model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the limitations and the solar irradiation levels received by building surfaces in different positions (with azimuth and tilt angle variation) in capital cities in Brazil are shown, making use of the Brazilian global horizontal solar irradiation data provided by the SWERA (Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment) project. These data were processed to generate figures on the irradiation at various PV module orientations and slopes for each city, which show the relative radiation levels received on specific azimuth and tilt angles in relation to the ideal position. Results were validated using four real and operating PV systems. In general, variations in azimuth or slope did not cause large annual irradiation losses up to around 20 degrees tilt angles. This shows to PV system planners that under these fairly flexible conditions it is possible to install PV on any orientation, keeping high levels of annual irradiation, and that limitations in orientation and tilt can be relatively low.

With present day commercially available PCM materials, a moderate increase of up to 3% of the total energy output can be expected. When taking into account the additional PCM material cost, a PV/PCM module presently is not economically viable. For an acceptable payback period of 1020years to be reached, the heat storage capacity of a PCM would require an increase of about one order of magnitude, which is presently not realistic. Nevertheless, a combination with building climate control in which the PCM plays a double role controlling both the PV temperature as well as the inside climate temperature may be feasible.

Experimental data have been compared with a simulation model built in MATLAB. Modelling agreed with the results obtained from the experiments. The results demonstrated the need for dividing the PV panels into two segments groups, each with the same orientation, and each with their own MPPT channel.

The technology, BP Saturn modules which were steel-blue polycrystalline silicon cells are no longer in production. A bespoke monitoring system has been designed to monitor the characteristics of 6 refurbished strings, of 18 modules connected in series. The total output of the system is configured to 6.5 kWp (series to parallel configuration). In addition to experimental results, the performance ratio (PR) of known values was simulated using PVSyst, a simulation software package. From calculations using experimental values, the PV system showed approximately 10% inferior power outputs to what would have been expected as standard test conditions. However, efficiency values in comparison to standard test conditions and the performance ratio (similar to 75% from PVSyst simulations) over the past decade have remained practically the same. This output though very relevant to the possible performance and stability of aging cells, requires additional parametric studies to develop a more robust argument.

The 2 kWp double-junction amorphous silicon PV system was retrofitted to the Solar Energy Laboratory's (LABSOLAR) building envelope, and connected through four commercial line-commutated inverters to the building's supply network. To demonstrate the architectural features of thin film PV technologies, both semitransparent and opaque modules were mounted on a north-facing, latitude-tilted overhang configuration. BIPV systems operating under the warmer conditions common in Brazil will typically experience relatively high operating temperatures, which suits the a-Si PV technology well. The installation is fully instrumented and is continuously, monitored in order to allow the performance assessment of amorphous silicon PV operating at the prevailing conditions, This paper describes the design of the installation and presents system performance data from the first 18 months of operation.

Overheating is known to be one of the major deficiencies in reaching the targeted lifespan goals. Alongside the thermal degradation, the operational efficiency of the silicon-based solar panel drops when the surface temperature exceeds certain thresholds close to 25 degrees C. Wind-driven cooling, therefore, is widely recommended to decrease the surface temperature of PV panels using cavity cooling through their rear surfaces. Wind-driven flow can predominantly contribute to cavity cooling if a suitable design for the installation of the BIPV systems is considered. In general, various correlations in the form of Nu = CRea are adapted from heat convection of flat-plates to calculate the heat removal from the BIPV surfaces. However, these correlations demonstrate a high discrepancy with realistic conditions due to a more complex flow around BIPVs in comparison with the flat plate scenarios. This study offers a significantly more reliable correlation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique to visualize and thus investigate the flow characteristics around and beneath BIPVs. The CFD model is comprehensively validated against a particle velocimetry and a thermography study by Mirzaei et al. (2014) and Mirzaei and Carmeliet (2013b). The velocity field shows a very good agreement with the experimental results while the average surface temperature has a 6.0 % discrepancy in comparison with the thermography study. Unlike the former correlations, the coefficients are not constant numbers, but a function of the airflow velocity, in the newly proposed correlation, which is in the form of Nu(L) = 0.1513Re(L)(0.7065).

It produces electricity from a 110.5 kWp building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system where heat is also recovered from a section of the array and used to preheat the outdoor air intake. The building's many architectural and mechanical features were integrally designed to achieve the net zero energy target over a five-year averaging period with several key decisions made at the early design stage. These include the shape, area, and orientation of the roof that maximizes electricity production from the BIPV (partBIPV/T[building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal with heat recovery]) system and a design layout that promotes daylight penetration and natural ventilation/free cooling during the cooling season. In the first year after inauguration, an operational energy use intensity (EUI) of 24.8 kBtu/ft(2)y (78.1 kWh/m(2)y) was achieved and has since been reduced to 22.20 kBtu/ft(2)y (70.0 kWh/m(2)y). Considering renewables production, the net-energy use intensity (EUI) is 4.60 kBtu/ft(2)y (14.5 kWh/m(2)y). This is a 95% EUI reduction over the national institutional average and can be further reduced with additional (ongoing) commissioning efforts. Suggested improvements in operation include ensuring the electricity production is optimized and any faults corrected, dimming electric lighting when daylight is sufficient, extending the hours of natural ventilation, and better utilization of the hydronic radiant slab for thermal storage using predictive controls.

The study involved calculating the impact of each parameter on the convection, conduction and radiation components of the incoming solar energy. S/V was shown to be directly proportional to the amount of solar energy received by the facades and gained by the building in the form of heat. The positive correlation of heat gain with S/V was nearly linear with a slope of around 41.8 kWh/m(2)/m(-1) and a mean of approximately 3.4 times more. With the most suitable geometry in terms of net energy gain, S/V of 0.14 m(-1) yielded the highest difference between energy production and heat gain. In terms of beta, the results demonstrated negative slope of energy production with respect to the tilt at about 2.12 times higher than that displayed by heat gain.

After developing its configuration and installation procedure, the thermal and electrical performance of the proposed PVPC facade is numerically simulated based on real-time ambient temperature and solar radiation data. The prototype of PVPC facade is constructed in a factory and then demonstrated in a field. Onsite operating data has been collected to validate simulation results and evaluate the performance of the proposed facade. The simulation results show that the PVPC facade can generate approximately 62.56 kWh/m(2) electricity annually. The maximum temperature difference between external and internal PVPC facade is approximately 16.00 degrees C in summer and 35.03 degrees C in winter, demonstrating that the proposed PVPC facade can not only generate electricity but also reduce the cooling/heating load of the building, and in total about 64.34 kWh/m(2) of electricity can be saved per year for the air-conditioning system due to the thermal resistance effect of the PVPC facade. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the influence of certain factors, such as the thickness of the insulation, air gap and wind speed, on the thermal and electrical performance of PVPC facade.

The validated models are incorporated into Energy Plus to carry out overall energy consumption analyses in five climate regions in Japan to assess the energy saving potential of the semi-transparent PV panels. With appropriate optimization measures, the semi-transparent PV top light with 50% radiation transmission rate contributes to a maximum of 5.3% reduction in heating and cooling energy consumption compared with a standard BiPV roof. The effect of daylighting in lighting energy saving is subtle as most of the residential lighting demand occur during night-time.

Productive facades (PFs), as flexible and multi-functional systems integrating photovoltaic (PV) and vertical farming (VF) systems, could contribute to transforming buildings and communities from consumers to producers. This study analyses the architectural quality of the developed PF concept drawing on the findings of a web-survey conducted among experts - building professionals in Singapore. The developed design variants are compared with regards to key design aspects such as facade aesthetics, view from the inside, materialisation, ease of operation, functionality and overall architectural quality. The study also compares and discusses the results of the web-survey with the results of a previously conducted door-to-door survey among the potential users - residents of the Housing & Development Board (HDB) blocks. The findings confirm an overall acceptance of the PF concept and reveal a need for synergetic collaboration between architects/designers and other building professionals.

This paper proposes a novel economic structure between the residential consumers and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to determine the energy label of the smart residential buildings within the framework of the energy efficiency policies. The proposed structure is a developed model of the existing national certificates, such as Energy Star. In the proposed method, the concept of the energy labeling was improved based on the optimization problem by considering the hourly injected energy from the utility to buildings and annual energy consumption. In addition, an incentive mechanism was designed to encourage volunteer customers to change their consumption patterns based on the presented energy labeling structure. The incentive mechanism is flexible and can be changed by the system operator considering the energy label variation. Different practical methods, which included the economic heat and electrical demands model, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), and building integrated plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), were evaluated to promote the energy label of the residential building. For practical implementation, the proposed structure was applied to a sample smart residential building in East-Azerbaijan of Iran, and it was solved using GAMS software. The numerical results based on realistic data validated the effectiveness of the presented practical methods within the framework of the introduced energy labeling structure. According to the obtained results, the energy label index of the selected test system was promoted from F to E in the presence of the economic demand model and PHEV and promoted to D by using the economic demand model and BIPV system. In addition, the amount of energy injected into the building was decreased by up to 2.52% through the economic demand and PHEV schemes and up to 17.22% in the presence of the BIPV system.

Among the 10 selected morphology parameters, the correlation analysis shows the correlation performances of both definitions of SVF are the strongest (r = 0.94 to 1). As obtaining the value of SVF is not simple, two multilinear regression predictive models for rooftop and facade irradiance are developed.

Changing facilities from net energy users to net energy producers is a major concern for supply chain managers who are interested in greening their business. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is an innovative design idea to achieve energy positive buildings. In a BIPV building, photovoltaic (PV) arrays are integrated into the structure of the building in order to transform the incident solar radiation to clean energy that can be used in facility operations. This option is dependent on the economic attractiveness of the solar PVs, which, in return, depends on the policies (incentives, subsidies, feed-in tariff) in effect at the facility location, the efficiency of the PVs installed, and the amount of incident solar radiation at the facility location. We present an economic model that calculates the cost per kWh capacity of solar PVs installed and then integrate the decision of installing PVs of different sizes on the facility rooftops of a supply chain subject to the different environmental policies available. We study the implications of our model based on a sensitivity analysis for different carbon credit prices, PV generation costs, and feed-in tariff prices. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Partial shading due to nearby objects is a typical problem for facade building-integrated photovoltaics as it strongly reduces the output power of the installation. Distributed maximum power point tracking by means of embedded converters and a common direct current bus has been proposed to alleviate this issue. However, the bus voltage plays an important role in converter topology selection and overall efficiency, although this is not being covered in literature. Also the influence of the solar cell technology on the output voltage of the module is not studied before, although it strongly influences the converter topology selection and the losses. In this paper, a methodology is described to investigate the influence of the voltage level and solar cell technology by taking conversion losses in the converters and the cabling into account. The methodology is applied to two case study buildings for which four different cell technologies are considered. It is shown that overall high efficiencies are obtained, regardless of the voltage level. However, the loss distribution changes significantly with the voltage. This aspect can be used advantageously to reduce thermal stresses on the embedded converter.

Both functions require battery storage and the sizing of battery using numerical optimization is popularly used. However, the weather conditions, outage events and demand peaks are not deterministic in nature. Therefore, the sizing of battery storage capacity should also be based on a probabilistic approach. The Monte Carlo simulation is a rigorous method to sizing BIPV system as it takes into account a real building load profiles, the weather information and the local historical outage distribution. The simulation is split into seasonal basis for the analysis of demand shifting and outage events in order to match the seasonal weather conditions and load profiles. Five configurations of PV (photovoltaic) are assessed that cover different areas and orientations. The simulation output includes the predicted PV energy yield, the amount of energy required for demand management and outage event. Therefore, consumers can base sizing decisions on the historical data and local risk of outage statistics and the success rate of meeting the demand shift required. Finally, the economic evaluations together with the sensitivity analysis and the assessment of customers' outage cost are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A small prototype CPV module of 300 mm x 300 mm was constructed with 2 strings of 14 solar cells in series. The prototype CPV module was characterised in Edinburgh for different weather conditions and the performance is compared with a similar non-concentrating counterpart (i.e. a flat-plate module with the same PV cell area and technology) in real time. The electrical output results for a cloudy day, rainy day and a day with sunny intervals have been reported to evaluate the performance of the concentrating system with direct and diffuse irradiance. The maximum power output of the CPV module on the day with sunny intervals was found to be 5.88 W for a solar radiation input of 943 W/m(2), which is 2.27 times higher than that for the flat-plate module. The average short circuit current of the CPV module was found to be 2.22 times higher than that of the flat-plate module. The average open circuit voltage and fill factor of the CPV module were also found to be 2.5% and 1.6% higher than that for the flat-plate module. The CPV module is found to be very effective on the rainy day with an average power output of 0.13 W, which is 2.17 times higher than the average output power for the flat-plate module.

This paper presents a laboratory based experimental investigation undertaken to determine the potential for high temperature operation in such a BIPV installation. This is achieved by ascertaining the dependence of the PV roof tile temperature on incident radiation and ambient temperature. A theory based correction was developed to account for the unrealistic sky temperature of the solar simulator used in the experiments. The particular PV roof tiles used are warranted up to an operational temperature of 85 degrees C, anything above this temperature will void the warranty because of potential damage to the integrity of the encapsulation. As a guide for installers, a map of Southern Europe has been generated indicating locations where excessive module temperatures might be expected and thus where installation is inadvisable.

This assumption is confirmed by the energy produced per nominal watt-peak for the duration of the measurement campaign by the DSC that is 12% higher than that by a-Si and only 3% lower than that by m-Si for these operating conditions.

Zn(O,S) has a strong interest for the development of UV-selective solar cells with high transparency in the visible region, required for the development of nonintrusive building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) elements as transparent solar windows and glass-based solar facades. By anion alloying, Zn(O,S) mixed crystal absorbers can be fabricated with different sulfur content across the whole compositional range.

By introducing a thin C-60 film as electron transport layer (ETL), charge extraction is enhanced, and devices show an efficiency of 0.5% and an AVT > 69%.

It highlights the main constrains that discourage such modern concept in building and construction. Three groups have been questioned using a questionnaire. These are the policy and decision makers, the leading consultants and the contractors. The main constrains of the dissemination of BIVP and BIWE, according to the policy and decision makers, are: lack of knowledge and awareness of the public in sustainable technology, low cost of electricity, low cost of gas and oil and difficulty in applying local environmental taxes. The consultants had attributed the constrains to ignorance of life cycle cost of PV and Wind turbines systems, lack of education and knowledge in sustainable design, political system, shortage of markets importing sustainable technologies and client worries in profitability and pay-back period. The contractors are found to be very enthusiastic and ready to take over any sustainable building project and prefer to have a construction manger to coordinate between the design and contracting team. Design and Build is found the favorable procurement method in Bahrain for conducting BIPV or BIWE projects.

However, one of the main barriers for a mature commercialization is due to the unpredictability of the renewable power production, mainly in case of wind and solar energy. Unfortunately, electric storage devices are often poorly profitable. Therefore, some more stable renewable energy systems must be designed. In this framework, this paper presents a novel hybrid renewable system consisting of Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic panels and small-scale Wind Turbines and double stage heat pumps. This combination is very promising since it reduces the typical fluctuations of solar or wind systems, achieving a more stable profile of the overall power production. A detailed dynamic simulation model is developed in TRNSYS environment, including validated models for all the components and a suitable thermoeconomic analysis. A case study is implemented for a hotel building, where the space heating and cooling energy is supplied by an electrically driven reversible air-to-water Heat Pump, supplied by the electricity produced by Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic panels and Wind Turbines. the thermal energy recovered from the HP desuperheater is coupled with the thermal energy produced by a two-stage cascade cycle Heat Pump to produce domestic hot water. Results are presented in terms of hourly, monthly and yearly system performance data as well as by discussing the results of a detailed sensitivity analysis performed to detect the optimum configuration and weather zone of this hybrid renewable system. An analysis of the building envelope features is also performed, according to the nearly zero energy buildings target. Results showed that the combination of photovoltaic and wind technologies allows one to significantly enhance the stability of the renewable power production. Results also show that the use of heat pumps leads to a reduction of the primary energy demand for building space heating/cooling and domestic hot water by 30%. A payback period of about 5.2 years is obtained and the optimum configuration suggests adopting one 20 kW Wind Turbine for the selected case study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports the performance analysis of a low concentrating dielectric compound parabolic concentrator designed for building facades integration in northern latitudes (>55 degrees). The range of the acceptance angles for the designed dielectric concentrator is 0-55 degrees, having a concentration ratio (CR) of 2.8. The concentrator is manufactured in clear polyurethane using a casting process. The average AM1.5G spectrum weighted transmittance, within spectral range 300-1100 urn, of the 16.4 mm thick polyurethane concentrator is found to be 81.9%. The performance of the designed concentrator is analysed using small prototype modules with 8 solar cells in series (1.89 W-p), under a solar simulator for different incidence angles. The optical losses that occur within the concentrator-encapsulation interface and cover glass have been reduced for better performance. The indoor characterisation of the concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) module results in a maximum power ratio of 2.27 when compared to a similar non-concentrating counterpart, for 1000 W/m(2) light energy incident at 20 degrees. The maximum experimental optical efficiency of the CPV system is found to be 80.5%; this result gives the electrical conversion efficiency of the CPV module to be an average of 9.43% with a maximum 12.1% within the range of acceptance angle of the designed concentrator. It is observed that that the power ratio decreases near the acceptance half-angles of the designed concentrator due to the optical losses caused by scattering and escaping of light from the edge of the receiver. Investigation of the optical losses from the parabolic sides of the concentrator shows that, the imperfect parabolic surface caused by machining error results in scattering with a fraction of light escaping from the parabolic side instead of reflecting back to the receiver for all angles of incidence. Cost analysis shows that the designed CPV modules can result in a 20% reduction in the cost per unit power output of the system in the current market scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In a previous work we demonstrated the feasibility of adopting porcelain stoneware tiles as thin-film solar cell substrates and we fabricated 1 x 1 cm(2) solar cells on industrial-level ceramic substrates showing more than 4% efficiency. in this study we focus our attention on larger area (7 cm(2)) devices deposited on 100 cm(2) tiles. As the active area increases additional problems arise from the surface of the substrate. In particular we find that short-circuit paths originate from the unfavorable properties of the substrate tiles (roughness, porosity, etc.) having dramatic consequences on the performance of larger area devices. With the assumption that spot-like regions, in which the back layer and the front layer are in electrical contact (local short-circuits), are present all over the device, we propose a new device structure to overcome the substrate drawbacks. A new contacts arrangement was designed in order to minimize the shunting effect of short-circuit paths.

Large buildings often have glass facades that have the potential to convert sunlight to electrical power. The standard photovoltaic materials used today are bulky and not transparent, making them poor candidates for solar windows. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and other two-dimensional absorbers are a good alternative because of their unique properties and high transparency at the monolayer and few-layer regime. This work shows the potential for TMDC-based solar windows by simulating the transmission, quantum efficiency, current density, and colour appearance of different solar cell configurations. Different contacts were investigated, along with the influence of contact thickness, to demonstrate colour-neutral solar cells. In addition, four TMDC materials were compared: MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2. Colour-neutral solar cells with transparencies of 35 % to 55 % are presented, where a current density of 8.33 mA/cm(2) was calculated for a solar cell with a 5-nm absorbing layer of MoSe2. While there are still challenges to overcome in terms of production, our simulations show that it is possible to use TMDCs for colour-neutral solar windows and act as a guideline for further research.",,,,"Agert, Carsten/F-3539-2017","Agert, Carsten/0000-0003-4733-5257; Lattyak, Colleen/0000-0001-6690-3585",,,,,,,,,,,,0932-0784,1865-7109,,,,AUG,2019,74,8,,,SI,,683,688,,10.1515/zna-2019-0134,,,,,,,WOS:000477853400006,,,,,,

The assessment is focused on their energy efficiency and degree of internal visual comfort conditions that they can ensure. The purpose of the comparison is to optimize the combination of shading systems and their integrated solar cells. Shading systems are grouped and studied according to their energy savings (production and reduction of cooling loads) and to the quality of the visual interior environment. For the study, computer simulations are used for the energy loads (needs/production) and both computer simulation and experimental physical models are used for the daylighting assessment. Moreover, through this research, the effect of specific geometrical characteristic of the PV modules installed is analyzed in relation to the energy needs and to the resulting visual conditions. Systems such as Brise-Soleil are proved to be the most efficient for integration of PV modules in relation to energy saving and quality interior conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Careful evaluation to determine suitable locations for photovoltaic installations is needed, however, as their efficiency is highly dependent on exposure to sun. Especially in urban environments, quantifying the shadows cast by other buildings and vegetation canopies may be essential. In the present study, we used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the influence of shading vegetation on solar irradiation estimates in five European towns. The fraction of annual solar irradiation lost to shading by existing vegetation ranged between 3% and 11%. The fraction lost was higher in winter and lower in summer. Due to greater incoming solar radiation in summer, however, more than 50% of annual loss was accounted for in summer. We suggest that at the broad scale of whole cities the influence of vegetation on rooftop solar potential estimates is negligible (especially in densely populated areas). Analyses which do not consider vegetation because of data availability nevertheless provide valuable insight into localities' solar potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we explain the concept of trapping the light escaping through the optical concentrator - encapsulant interface. Understanding how the losses incur is important for the development of concentrating photovoltaic systems. A case study is performed on a 3D Cross Compound Parabolic Concentrator (3DCCPC) based low concentrating photovoltaic system. Detailed optical analysis is presented quantifying the losses based on the thickness of the encapsulant spillage. Simulation results show that the optical efficiency drops from 84.5% to 55.6% whilst increase in the encapsulant spillage thickness from 0.1 mm to 3 mm. Use of reflective film is made along the bottom edges of the concentrator in order to make the interface region optically inactive to carry out refraction and trap the escaping light. Modelling shows that the optical losses can be completely managed by the use of the reflective film. Experiments are carried out by building a prototype in order to demonstrate the concept and validate the results. The short circuit current is found to increase by a maximum of 8.5%.-A maximum power ratio of 2.73 is observed at an incidence angle of 100 for the system using the reflective film compared to 2.56 without the reflective film.

This can be attributed to several reasons, including the high cost incurred in photovoltaic system, the availability of a well-developed power grid, the question of extra land use, and doubts still existing in its environmental impact especially in the production stage. Architects need not only to design and create buildings that are pleasing aesthetically, but also, possibly design buildings that are sustainable or would be so in the long run, as sustainability would be one of the main design philosophical concerns of the new millennium. This would mean that there is going to be much more reliance on renewable energy sources, to ensure less pollution to the environment. In addition, besides the more passive way of designing, such as siting, orientation, use of proper building materials, to ensure thermal insulation and day lighting during design, perhaps a more active way is to incorporate photovoltaics into the building proper. Photovoltaics have been technically proven with a service life of about 20 to 30 years, though the actual effective operating life could reach beyond 50 years. However, in the context of Malaysia, the possibility of integrating photovoltaics into buildings eliminates the need for extra land to implement such systems. Moreover, photovoltaics help to serve as alternative electrical supplements during the peak hours of the day. They also replace some of the cost of the building materials while producing almost totally free electricity during their lifetimes. One important point to note in the study of building integrated design is that there will always be the conflict between photovoltaic solar considerations and contemporary building conventions. In our tropical context, building envelopes are normally designed to minimise the amount of radiation falling on the surface of a building, as cooling the interior of the building is usually required. On the contrary, photovoltaic integrated designs will prefer to maximise the area of the building envelopes so as to receive more radiation. Thus, a balance needs to be struck between these two considerations and this depends largely on the circumstances of individual project.",,,,"Lim, Chin Haw/C-7901-2011; Lim, Chin Haw/K-1869-2016","Lim, Chin Haw/0000-0001-6438-6174; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,972-9027-31-5,,,,2002,,,,,,,819,826,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179444800102,,,,,,

The results indicate a highly affirmative response among a very high percentage of respondents towards gardening. They also indicate that PF concepts promoting small-scale VF adequately fit the needs of HDB residents. The preferences of the potential future users regarding PF types are further presented and discussed.

The problem with most of the BIPV glazing lies in the obstruction of occupants' vision of the outdoor view. In order to resolve this problem, new technology has emerged that utilizes quantum dots semiconductors (QDs) in glazing systems. QDs can absorb and re-emit the incoming radiation in the desired direction with the tunable spectrum, which renders them favorable for building integration. By redirecting the radiation towards edges of the glazing, they can be categorized as luminescent solar concentrators (QD-LSCs) that can help to generate electricity while maintaining transparency in the glazing.

Literature from various disciplines was reviewed to establish correlations between the optical and electrical properties of different types, sizes, thicknesses, and concentration ratios of QDs when used in transparent glazing.

PTEBU model is forced with temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation above the roof level and incorporates detailed data of PV system and urban canyon in Tianjin, China. The simulation results show that PV roof and PV facade with ventilated air gap significantly change the building surface temperature and sensible heat flux density, but the air temperature of urban canyon with PV module varies little compared with the urban canyon of no PV. The PV module also changes the magnitude and pattern of diurnal variation of the storage heat flux and the net radiation for the urban canyon with PV increase slightly.

This has several advantages compared to other colouring techniques, i.e. coloured glass or additional interlayers. The OMO colouring does not require an additional process step, and with sputtering an already existing deposition method is used. By varying the thickness of the oxide layers it is possible to change the reflected spectrum of the stack and with it the module colour.

Subsequent to this, a specific system model has been designed and developed in MATLAB Simulink application. The selection of PV system specifications is based on practical system implementation. The inverter control system along with the reactive power control has been developed for the proper system operation at different system conditions to reduce the var compensation on the utility grid. Better system accuracy of the developed system model has been found by validating with real system data. The overall system performance has indicated that the effective utilization of reactive power control of a grid-connected PV system yields to a stable, reliable and cost-effective system network operation which reduces the heavy burden on the utility grid to control the PV system effects.

Usually, a hierarchy of potentials are calculated which gradually include restrictions for the use of a specific renewable resource. This paper deals with the estimation of the technical potential of roof-integrated photovoltaic systems. The most restrictive step when estimating this potential for large-scale territories is the estimation of the roof available area in existing buildings, for which no direct data exists. The methodology proposed in this paper allows to estimate the roof area available for solar applications and also quantify the error made in this estimation. It is based on easily accessible data (such as land uses and population and building densities) and on a statistically representative stratified-sample of vectorial GIS maps of urban areas. The main point in this sampling process is that the stratification is done based on a finite set of average building typologies which comprises every urban area in the region of study. An interesting characteristic emerging from the proposed methodology is its scalability and the possibility of being used front regional to continental scales. This methodology is applied in this work to Spain and a mean available area for photovoltaic equipment on roofs of 14.0 +/- 4.5 m(2)/ca. with a confidence level of 95%, is obtained. Additionally, results are given for the technical limit of production of roof-integrated photovoltaic energy. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A scenario approach and an OFAT sensitivity analysis were used to evaluate feasibility (IRR, NPV, cash flow and payback) based on existing electricity charging policies and usual long-term financing plans for social housing programs. The results for all the proposed scenarios indicate that photovoltaics are an environmentally and economically feasible alternative. Deploying between four to seven 217 W photovoltaic panels onto each house would meet the needs of all solar irradiation zones considered, making dwellers significantly less dependent on the grid and capable of up to 47% grid feedback for up to 30 years.

This paper proposes an approach to mitigate the strains transferred from structural members to PV cells through the partial composite action provided by low-modulus adhesives. Specimens were fabricated by bonding amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV cells to glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) structural components by an adhesive layer of 0.5- or 2.0-mm thickness. Two types of adhesives were used including a two-part rigid epoxy adhesive and a low-modulus silicone adhesive. These integrations were then submitted to inplane compressive loadings. PV cells bonded by the silicone adhesive showed no damages during loading. While for PV cells bonded by epoxy adhesives, obvious electrical performance degradations were observed, when the strain reached 0.62% or 0.23% for specimens bonded by epoxy with a layer thickness of 0.5 mm or 2.0 mm respectively. Debonding and local-buckling of the PV cells were also witnessed. Theoretical analysis was conducted to understand the strain mitigation of the adhesive as a result of the induced partial composite action. Results demonstrate that such strain differences between the GFRP and the bonded PV cell are dominated by the shear modulus and thickness of the adhesive layer as well as elastic modulus, thickness and length of the PV cell.

Several key parameters including the ignition temperature and time, heat release rate (HRR), and concentration of toxic gases are investigated.

Both transposition models are validated with experimental measurements taken in Murcia (southeast of Spain) and datasets provided by the photovoltaic geographical information system (PVGIS) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for vertical surfaces facing the four cardinal points. For the validation, the mean bias deviation, root mean square error and forecasted skill were used as indicators. Results show that the error rate decreases slightly for clear days. Better results are also obtained by dismissing data with low solar elevation angles so as to avoid shadowing effects from the surroundings in the early and late hours of the day, which affects mainly the performance of the transposition models for west and east surfaces.

In this article, we present three case studies at different scales (from hundreds of W-p to a 2.1 MWp plant), where automated parameter monitorization and data analysis has been carried out, aiming to detect failures and provide recommendations for optimum maintenance procedures. For larger systems, the data collected by the inverters provides the best source of information, and the cross-correlated analysis which uses these data is the best strategy to detect failures in module strings and failures in the inverters themselves (an average of 32.2% of inverters with failures was found after ten years of operation). In regards to determining which module is failing, the analysis of thermographic images is reliable and allows the detection of the failed module within the string (up to 1.5% for grave failures and 9.1% of medium failures for the solar plant after eleven years of activity). Photovoltaic (PV) systems at different scales require different methods for monitorization: Medium and large systems depend on inverter automated data acquisition, which can be complemented with thermographic images.

Thus, this paper reviewed direct transmittance degradation works of PV module surface glasses, and employed several integrated and improved experiment and model methods to investigate the correlation effects of PM2.5 deposition dynamics, tilt angles, surface conditions and self-cleaning TiO2 nanocoating on glasses. Series of physical models from ambient aerosol concentration to deposition density and transmittance reduction were extended or newly developed. Measured and modeled data could inter-validate with each other and literature results. The usage condition of Al-Hasan model was discovered as 0< a(p) < 0.10 for particle projected-area fraction under clustering particle projected-area fraction a(pcp) <= 5%. Ranging from 0 to 18.7 mu g/cm(2), deposition densities with the most reductions (50-91%) were found under the combination of wet and nanocoating conditions due to effects of water film and low adhesive force. Generally, the average deposition densities decreased 19-47% with the increase of each 30 degrees tilt angle for different surface properties. Finally, six linear empirical models were obtained with decreasing slopes of 0.001544-0.001841 between fine aerosol deposition density and transmittance ratio.

The adaptive control of the solar facade is determined through an optimisation algorithm that minimises the net energy demand. In this paper, we first evaluate the sensitivity of the adaptive solar facade to the thermal performance of the building envelope for a south facing room in Zurich. We then evaluate the performance of an adaptive solar facade on 11 building use types spanning six construction periods. In addition, we compare the performance of an adaptive system against an equivalent static photovoltaic system, and a facade with no shading system. Our results show that the adaptive solar facade performs best in buildings that have a high cooling demand and low heating demand. This is because the optimum configurations for cooling minimisation generate the maximum photovoltaic electricity. As a result, we notice a higher energy saving potential in newer buildings with low envelope thermal transmittance (U-value or infiltration). However, in buildings with a very high cooling demand, and no heating demand, there is only a small improvement in performance compared to an equivalent static system. An adaptive solar facade is therefore an optimum solution when there are both heating demands, and cooling demands present. Modern offices, retail stores, food stores, and schools have this property and perform well with an adaptive solar facade compared to an equivalent static system, and a facade with no shading.

The fully-monitored, 2kWp installation uses 40m(2) of glass-glass, double-junction, thin-film amorphous silicon (a-Si) PV laminates, which were retrofitted to the existing solar energy research laboratory (LABSOLAR) building, at latitude tilt and facing north. The installation is connected to the low-voltage distribution grid via four line-commutated sinewave inverters, and has been operating and logging operational data continuously since start up. The negligible effect of temperature on the output performance of the a-Si thin-film technology, associated with the large solar energy resource availability in the Brazilian territory, and the consequent large PV module operating temperatures, were decisive in the original selection of this thin-film technology. This has resulted in high performance ratios (over 85% and 80% at the DC and AC levels respectively) and also in a high annual energy yield (1300 kWh/kWp/year for a 1550 kWh/m(2)/year irradiation level at the site) reported in this paper. Furthermore, with the operational results from this installation, we have been able to demonstrate the potential of grid-connected PV as a peak shaving tool in an urban area in a developing country. In this paper we show how PV can be strategically and conveniently sited in the metropolitan area of a capital city, in order to optimise the benefits of this distributed energy generating technology.",,,,"Ruther, Ricardo/U-5503-2019; Ruther, Ricardo/AAL-6149-2020","Ruther, Ricardo/0000-0003-1240-796X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-7-302-16146-2,,,,2007,,,,,,,1606,+,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252634501143,,,,,,

Both water and air have been used for PV cooling through a thermal unit attached to the back of the module yielding photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector, but air is preferred due to minimal use of material and low operating cost despite its poor thermo-physical properties. This study investigates the performance of two low cost heat extraction improvement modifications in the channel of a PV/T air system to achieve higher thermal output and PV cooling so as to keep the electrical efficiency at acceptable level. The use of thin flat metal sheet suspended at the middle or finned back wall of an air channel in the PV/T air configuration are the suggested methods. A theoretical model is developed and validated against experimental data, where good agreement between the predicted results and measured data were achieved. The validated model was then used to study the effect of the channel depth, channel length and mass flow rate on electrical and thermal efficiency, PV cooling and pressure drop for both improved and typical PV/T air systems and their results were compared. Both experimental and theoretical results show that the suggested modifications improve the performance of the PV/T air system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Two types of PV cells are studied under the proposed approach including amorphous silicon (a-Si) and organic PV cells and the results demonstrate its practicability to determine the critical tensile strains reliably for both PV types. It is found that V-OC is more sensitive than I-SC to the applied tensile strain for both types of PV cells and substantial degradation in Voc for a-Si cells initiates at the tensile strain of 1.51%. For organic cells, significant reduction in V-OC is observed at the critical tensile strain of 1.46% in association with yielding of the substrate. While noticeable degradation can be only observed in I-SC from 1.67% strain for a-Si PV cells and from 3.09% strain for organic ones.

The STPV window was designed, manufactured and applied on a test building. Energy and environmental benefits were studied. The research site is located in an area with solar radiation diversification. The parameters of the life cycle assessment (LCA) model are derived from the database, experimental data and the electricity simulation model. The two important indicators, energy payback time (EPBT) and greenhouse gas payback time (GPBT), are selected to analysis this system, and another seven environmental indicators are considered for different aspects. According to the research findings, the EPBT of the STPV window is 13.8 years, and the GPBT 10.4 years, which are both less than the preset service life of 25 years. The results show that the STPV window can reduce pollution and the waste of non-renewable resources. The optimization analysis connected with the LCA study was carried out based on the critical parameters of the STPV window application in buildings. Optimal directions and preferable locations can result in the STPV window being more economical and sustainable. With increase of the window-to wall ratio (WWR) and the coverage ratio of PV cells, the EPBT and GPBT gradually become shorter.

However, after producing electrical energy, the remaining solar energy is transferred as heat, raising the temperature at the rear of the BIPV module, and reducing electrical efficiency. On the other hand, a PVT (Photovoltaic Thermal) collector is a device that generates electricity from a PV module and at the same time uses the heat transferred to the air layer inside the collector. In general, the performance of air-type PVT collectors is based on energy analysis using the first law of thermodynamics. Since this performance does not take into account the loss amount, it is not the actual amount of power generation and preheat of the collector that can be used. Therefore, an exergy analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics considering the amount of energy loss must be performed. In this paper, an air-type PVT collector to which perforated baffles were applied was tested through outdoor experiments based on ISO 9806 standard. The total energy (thermal and electrical characteristics) and exergy according to the flow rate (100, 150, and 200 m(3)/h), solar radiation, and rear temperature of the PV module of the air-type PVT collector were analyzed. As a result, the total exergy efficiency of the air-type PVT collector with perforated baffles was 24.8-30.5% when the total energy efficiency was 44.1-63.3%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,MAY,2021,14,10,,,,,,,2919,10.3390/en14102919,,,,,,,WOS:000662353500001,,,,,,
